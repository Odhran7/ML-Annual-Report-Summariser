 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business 

the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows  the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic continues to be uncertain and rapidly changing as a result of new variants and vaccines measures enacted by authorities and actions taken by the company to mitigate the spread of the covid19 pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and shutdowns have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the covid19 pandemic and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed additionally such measures could in and of themselves impact our ability to perform critical functions a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities as a result of illness government restrictions or other workforce disruptions or absenteeism or reductions in capacity utilization levels could result in us incurring additional direct costs and experiencing lost revenue illness travel restrictions or workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business the covid19 pandemic could disrupt our supply chain operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our brokers or distributors these disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs or cause delays or inability to deliver products to our customers we have experienced temporary disruptions to our supply chain in certain markets these disruptions to our work force and supply could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates and energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges we expect the covid19 pandemic may result in lower revenues in some of our emerging market countries that have a higher concentration of traditional trade outlets such as small familyrun stores 

the duration and significance of this sustained demand is uncertain although our business has benefited from some of these measures volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

• consumers may shift purchases to more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns which could result in a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings adversely affecting the results of our operations 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic could result in delays or modifications to our strategic plans and initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our objective to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and currencies in the countries in which we operate could negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses 

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of illness or government restrictions or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work 

• an increased reliance on our information technology systems due to many employees working remotely causing us to be increasingly subject to cyberattack 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities or disruption in our supply chain including but not limited to as a result of illness government restrictions or other workforce disruptions 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to among other things reduced instore visits and travel restrictions 

• decreased demand for our products due to unemployment as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• volatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact our result of operations and our commodity hedging activities might not sufficiently offset this volatility 

• volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially impact our pension costs and required pension contributions and 

• increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and commercial paper markets could limit our access to our preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section such as those relating to our reputation brands product sales results of operations or financial condition the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic is uncertain rapidly changing and depends on events beyond our knowledge or control we might not be able to anticipate or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results as a result the impact of the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management  we are utilizing formal revenue growth management practices to help us realize price in a more effective way this datadriven approach addresses price strategy pricepack architecture promotion strategy mix management and trade strategies revenue growth management involves changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers consumers or thirdparty providers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits in addition the complexity of the execution requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers any failure to execute revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands  we have a number of iconic brands with significant value promoting and protecting the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we or any of our employees or agents have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our labor relations whether or not valid our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences the products becoming unavailable to consumers or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products whether or not valid including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity in addition due to our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers consume food products and their desire for premium or value offerings provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences accordingly we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts or use datadriven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message the growing use of social and digital media platforms by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands our products our labor relations or any of our employees or agents on social or digital media platforms could seriously damage our brands reputation and brand loyalty regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns marketing programs and sponsorships as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex 

network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations warehousing and distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters water availability fires or explosions terrorism political unrest government restrictions mandates or shutdowns tariffs and other trade restrictions cybersecurity breaches health pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers their suppliers or our contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information technology production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes 

the union representing employees at our us ready to eat cereal manufacturing locations went on strike for almost three months in 2021 related to negotiations of a collectively bargained agreement covering employees at those plants resulting in business disruptions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

in addition we experienced increased demand for many of our products during the covid19 pandemic and were at times unable to fill all customer orders short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives  our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we have delayed the implementation of system upgrades and certain other costsaving and productivity initiatives due to the covid19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our cost savings and productivity initiatives on the same timelines 

structural and organizational risks 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses  from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local laws and regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

to the extent we undertake divestitures in the future we may face additional risks related to such activity for example risks related to our ability to find appropriate buyers to execute transactions on favorable terms to separate divested businesses from our remaining operations and to effectively manage any transitional service arrangements any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business  we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals including individuals with ecommerce digital marketing and data analytics capabilities we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented personnel any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who terminate their employment or become ill as a result of covid19 or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results  additionally changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

risks related to our industry 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities packaging fuel and labor  agricultural commodities including corn wheat rice potato flakes vegetable oils sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy regulation andor shutdown import and export requirements including tariffs global geopolitical conditions general economic conditions including inflationary pressures drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change a pandemic illness such as the covid19 outbreak or other unforeseen circumstances specifically certain ingredients packaging and other goods and services have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and inflationary pressures and although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source such materials and services in the future we expect these supply pressures and market disruptions to continue into 2022 to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn such as the covid19 pandemic which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share food processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity oil natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane andor oil storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy regulation andor shutdown war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our results may be adversely affected by increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels  we rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver incoming ingredients to our manufacturing locations and to deliver finished products to our customers  shortages of truck drivers and railroad workers have contributed to increased freight costs which has had a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  in 2021 the cost of distribution increased due to an increase in transportation and logistics costs transportation costs are further increasing as a result of high levels of longhaul driver turnover and increased railroad traffic and service issues  additionally energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry  we face competition across our product lines including snacks readytoeat cereals and other convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions the principal aspects of our business where we face competition include brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space navigating the growing ecommerce marketplace convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and customer service most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do our competition with other companies in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences 

in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or consumer preferences more quickly than us category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

in addition in nearly all of our product categories we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

the changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels could negatively impact our sales and profits  our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 19 of consolidated net sales during 2021 comprised principally of sales within the united states no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2021 during 2021 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 53 of us net sales there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers have sought and may continue to seek in the future to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms such consolidation can continue to adversely impact our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume 

growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

additionally alternative retail channels such as ecommerce retailers including as a result of the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers subscription services discount and dollar stores directtoconsumer brands drug stores and club stores have continued to grow this trend away from traditional retail grocery and towards such channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be negatively impacted in particular substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits in addition these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation affecting our large retail and wholesale customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases also if these alternative retail channels such as ecommerce retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes  there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced loyalty reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products  we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the companys existing products the companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations  climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets  adverse changes such as these could i unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water ii disrupt production schedules and our ability or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers to manufacture or distribute our products iii reduce crop size or quality iv disrupt the retail operations of our customers or v unfavorably impact the demand for or the consumers ability to purchase our products 

there is an increased focus by foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions energy policies and sustainability including single use plastics this new or increased focus may result in new or increased laws and regulations that could cause significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change as well as actions taken to mitigate climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

risks related to our operations 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition  our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions have occurred including am almost threemonth long strike in fiscal 2021 related to negotiations of a collectively bargained agreement at our us readytoeat cereal manufacturing locations and could occur in the future if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business  we participate in “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our us based employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability payments and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan would depend in part on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability one of the multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could impact the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions  increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and could negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation an increase in participants enrolled the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to 

operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

from time to time we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates “ibors” and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor libor or the london interbank offered rate is expected to be phased out after 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate once libor ceases to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties although we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this transition given our current mix of fixed and variablerate debt our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

we utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital if the extension of payment terms is reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation our ability to maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted  our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of offering extended customer payment terms we entered into agreements to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization programs in addition in combination with extending supplier payment terms we have agreements with third parties accounts payable program to offer structured payables programs to our suppliers which enable suppliers at their sole discretion to enter bilateral agreements to sell company payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions 

if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms working capital could be negatively impacted additionally working capital could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations for suppliers participating in the accounts payable program financial institutions may terminate their participation or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity or increase our longterm borrowings 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks as of january 1 2022 we had total debt of approximately 70 billion and total kellogg company equity of 37 billion our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including i impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade ii a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm credit rating would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue increase our commercial paper borrowing costs or both iii restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business iv requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions paying dividends repurchasing shares marketing and other spending and expansion of our product offerings v and causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not 

amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and other intangibles while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of january 1 2022 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment 

as of january 1 2022 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 82 billion of which 58 billion was goodwill and 24 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 182 billion and total kellogg company equity of 37 billion 

risks related to regulations and litigation 

we face risks related to tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes  the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions including shifts in the geopolitical landscape tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax reform” and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination food borne illnesses spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united 

states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies legal and regulatory systems can change quickly as demonstrated by brexit  in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic regulatory or social events in addition the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling sustainability of packaging including plastics import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products 

the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory reforms changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation 

modifications to international trade policy including the ratification of the united statesmexicocanada agreement changes in the european union such as brexit or the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas or trade barriers on key commodities with other countries could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve including as a result of related uncertainty and could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows higher duties on existing tariffs or additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we are not able to offset 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks  our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

technology failures cyber attacks privacy breaches or data breaches could disrupt our operations reputation and negatively impact our business  we increasingly rely on information technology systems and thirdparty service providers including through the internet to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of many of our employees working remotely updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control including but not limited to network or hardware failures malicious or disruptive software unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors cyberattacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or socialactivist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters a pandemic illness such as covid19 failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events 

moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes social engineering attacks unauthorized access attempts password theft physical breaches employee or inside error malfeasance and cyber or phishingattacks cyber threats are constantly evolving are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions such as the maintenance of an information security program that includes updating our technology and security policies insurance employee training and monitoring and routinely testing our information technology systems to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information the company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the company’s existing and future technology systems in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the european union general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” which went into effect on january 1 2020 each of which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements in addition regulations to implement portions of the ccpa have not been finalized and could significantly impact ccpa compliance measures for example the california privacy rights act the “cpra” which was approved by california voters as a ballot initiative in november 2020 modifies the ccpa significantly and was effective on january 1 2022 several other states have introduced or passed similar legislation to the ccpa and cpra which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection use and processing activities our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws including the gdpr ccpa and cpra may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time 

if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches issues with or errors in system maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication or other incident involving one of the companys vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational 

competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability and government investigations which may adversely affect the companys results of operations andor financial condition the misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and the company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems in addition if the companys suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the companys supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the companys business operations we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers including cloudbased service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands  we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products our technology or any other form of intellectual property or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products or operations in addition if in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly such finding could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

general risk factors 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally  we are a global company and generated almost half of our net sales for both 2021 and 2020 outside the united states we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include i compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as ofac trade sanction regulations and antiboycott regulations ii compliance with anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act the “ukba” iii compliance with antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes iv changes in tax laws interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes v fluctuations or devaluations in currency values especially in emerging markets vi changes in capital controls including currency exchange controls government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the united states vii changes in local regulations and laws the lack of wellestablished reliable andor impartial legal systems in certain countries in which we operate and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in such jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources viii laws relating to information security privacy including the gdpr cashless payments and consumer protection ix uncertainty relating to brexit and its impact on the local and international markets the flow of goods and materials across borders and political environments x discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies xi challenges associated with crossborder product distribution xii increased sovereign risk such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments xiii varying abilities to enforce intellectual property contractual and other legal rights xiv greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles xv loss of ability to manage our operations in certain markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses xvi design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base xvii imposition of more or new tariffs quotas trade barriers price controls and similar restrictions in the countries in which we or our suppliers or manufacturers 

operate or regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales and xviii changes in trade policies and trade relations 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest and government shutdowns civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political or social uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability  continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2022 for example the continuing uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic including new variants and the efficacy of vaccines brexit and international trade disputes as well as ongoing terrorist activity may adversely impact global stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which our common shares are traded and general global economic conditions all of these factors are outside of our control but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets 

our performance is affected by general economic political and social conditions and taxation policies  customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises including the covid19 pandemic recession financial and credit market disruptions government shutdowns or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic political and social conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency trade policy political and social unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business  the economic political and social conditions resulting from brexit and the uncertainty regarding the postbrexit trade agreement as defined below in the transition period and beyond among other events may adversely impact our overall performance 

deteriorating economic conditions in our major markets affected by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition such deterioration in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition in addition significant covid19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products could adversely impact our operations and results 

financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and as a result we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable causing our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results  we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar 

canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates for example as a result of the united kingdom’s termination of membership in the european union under new trade and cross border operating agreements there could be significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

the united kingdoms exit from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business  the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” became official as of january 31 2020 and triggered a transition period that expired on december 31 2020 during which time the united kingdom and the european union negotiated a postbrexit trade agreement tca which came into effect on january 1 2021 the uk and eu continue to discuss some elements of the tca in particular elements relating to the northern ireland protocol and the impact that has on trading borders between the eu and uk 

the main trade provisions in the tca include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the uk and eu subject to prescribed trade terms including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the uk and eu crossborder trade between the uk and eu is also subject to new customs regulations documentation and reviews 

kellogg has worked diligently to minimize the impact of brexit on the business however to comply with the new requirements we have had to increase resources in customer service and logistics in our factories and on our customs support teams we have adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions we continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials packaging and finished goods in the uk we have made investments in resources systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs 

despite our efforts to control costs we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our uk business this year as we have also experienced in other markets if the uk’s exit from or new trade arrangements with the eu negatively impact the uk economy or result in disagreements on trade terms then the impact to our operations financial condition and cash flows could be material 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions inclusive of class action lawsuits and foreign litigation including under general commercial employment environmental data privacy or security intellectual property food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting our rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs furthermore actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us as a result we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations

restructuring programs 

the company views its restructuring programs as part of its operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving its longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a 3 to 5year period subsequent to completion completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs is when the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

during 2021 the company announced a reconfiguration of the north america reportable segment supply chain network designed to drive increased productivity the project is expected to be substantially completed by early 2024 with related productivity improvements commencing in 2023 the overall project is expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately 45 million which include employeerelated costs of 4 million other cash costs of 21 million and noncash costs primarily consisting of accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs of 20 million charges incurred related to this restructuring program were approximately 5 million during 2021 these charges primarily related to severance costs and were recorded in cogs 

during 2019 the company announced a reorganization plan for its european reportable segment designed to simplify the organization increase organizational efficiency and enhance key processes the project was substantially completed as of the end of fiscal year 2020 total charges and cash costs were in line with expectations the company recorded total net charges of  1  million in 2020 with 7 million recorded in sga expense and 8 million recorded in oie the company recorded total net charges of 38 million in 2019 with 43 million recorded in sga expense and 5 million recorded in oie the project resulted in cumulative pretax net charges of approximately  37 million including certain noncash credits total cash costs were approximately  50 million the total charges include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to relocation pension curtailment gains third party legal and consulting fees and contract termination costs 

also during 2019 the company announced a reorganization plan which primarily impacted the north america reportable segment designed to simplify the organization that supports the remaining north america reportable segment after the divestiture and related transition the project was substantially completed as of the end of fiscal year 2020 total charges and cash costs were in line with expectations the company recorded total charges of  2 million and 21 million related to this initiative during 2020 and 2019 respectively these charges were recorded in sga expense the project has resulted in cumulative pretax charges of approximately  23 million total charges include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to third party consulting fees 

in addition to the projects discussed above during 2021 and 2020 the company incurred restructuring costs in each of its reportable segments related to various reorganization and simplification initiatives and supply chain optimization projects the company recorded total charges of 22 million related to these initiatives during 2021 including 16 million in cogs and 6 million in sga expense the company recorded total charges of 28 million related to these initiatives during 2020 including 6 million in cogs and 22 million in sga expense these costs primarily relate to severance and other termination benefits 

project k 

as of the end of 2019 the company completed implementation of all project k initiatives total project charges aftertax cash costs and annual savings delivered by project k were in line with expectations 

cumulatively project k resulted in total pretax charges of approximately 16 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments of approximately 12 billion 

annual cost savings generated from project k are approximately 700 million these savings were realized primarily in selling general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from gotomarket business model changes the overall savings profile of the project reflects our gotomarket initiatives that will impact both selling general and administrative expense and gross profit cost savings have been utilized to offset inflation and fund investments in areas such as instore execution sales capabilities including adding sales representatives and in the design and quality of our products we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

refer to note 5 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

interest expense was 223 million and 281 million for the years ended january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 respectively the decrease from the prior year is due primarily to debt redemption costs totaling 20 million in the prior year as well as lower average outstanding debt compared to the prior year interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for both periods 

interest income recorded in other income expense net was 12 million and 21 million for the years ended january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 respectively 

income taxes 

our reported effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 241 and 202 respectively 

the 2021 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by tax legislation in the uk and the establishment of a full valuation allowance related to certain foreign deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2021 the company recorded tax expense of 23 million as a result of tax legislation enacted in the uk in june 2021 which increased the statutory uk tax rate from 19 percent to 25 percent for tax periods after april 1 2023 the company revalued its net deferred tax balances related to the uk business to reflect the increased tax rate additionally d uring the third quarter the company determined that certain foreign deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized in the future and a full valuation allowance totaling 20 million was recorded on a discrete period basis 

the 2020 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the reversal of a liability for uncertain tax positions of 32 million resulting from the finalization of a tax examination during the third quarter the reserves were related to the companys estimate of the transition tax liability in conjunction with the finalization of accounting under staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act 

adjusted effective tax rates for 2021 and 2020 and were 219 and 222 respectively

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory rates additionally the rate could be impacted by tax legislation and if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 

liquidity and capital resources 

at this time the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and we anticipate current cash and marketable security balances operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other financing sources including commercial paper credit and bond markets will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect cash provided by operating activities of 1718 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 600 million in 2022 we currently have 25 billion of unused revolving credit agreements including 15 billion effective through 2026 and 10 billion effective through december 2022 as well as continued access to the commercial paper markets we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants and do not have material uncertainty about our ability to maintain compliance in future periods we continue to utilize available capacity within the monetization programs to maintain financial flexibility without negatively impacting working capital as the impact of covid19 on the economy and our operations evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity needs 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables the impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting these programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management 

we periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms to the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms we may seek to adjust our terms including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate supplier payment term modifications did not have a material impact on our cash flows during 2021 and are not expected to have a material impact in 2022 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts 

we had negative working capital of 19 billion and 18 billion as of january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 respectively 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing including commercial paper will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

net cash provided by our operating activities for 2021 totaled 1701 million compared to 1986 million in the prior year the decrease is due primarily to higher yearoveryear income tax payments and changes in incentive compensation and other accruals from the prior year 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is approximately negative 9 days and negative 11 days for 2021 and 2020 respectively core working capital in 2021 averaged 10 of net sales compared to 12 in 2020 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 20 million and 32 million for the years ended january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2022 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2022 of approximately 20 million actual 2022 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available over time for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2021 totaled 528 million compared to 585 million in 2020 

capital spending in 2021 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure including manufacturing capacity expansions in multiple markets and categories and initiatives targeting waste reductions and productivity improvements 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 39 and 37 in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

financing activities 

our net cash used in financing activities totaled 1306 million compared to 1388 million during the prior year the yearoveryear variance was driven by the repayment of €500 million sevenyear 175 euro notes upon maturity in may 2021 and the repurchase of 240 million of our common stock during the current year partially offset by the may 2021 issuance of €300 million eightyear 050 euro notes due 2029 

total debt was 71 billion and 75 billion at yearend 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the following table reflects net debt amounts 



in may 2021 we issued € 300 million of eightyear 050  euro notes due 2029 resulting in net proceeds of € 298 million after discount and underwriting commissions the 2029 euro notes were issued as a sustainability bond and thus an amount equal to the net proceeds will be used to finance or refinance in whole or in part one or more eligible environmental or social projects described in the companys sustainability bond framework the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions as well as a change of control provision additionally we repaid the € 500 million sevenyear 175  euro notes due 2021 upon maturity 

in may of 2020 we issued 500 million of tenyear 210 notes due 2030 resulting in net proceeds after 

debt discount of 496 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including 

the payment of offering related fees and expenses repayment of a portion of the 600 million 400 notes due 

2020 upon maturity and repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions as well as a change of control provision 

in december of 2020 we redeemed 198 million of our 3250 senior notes due 2021 and 358 million of our 3125 senior notes due 2022 additionally the remaining balance of the 600 million 400 notes due 2020 was redeemed upon maturity 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 231 per share in 2021 versus 228 per share in 2020 on february 18 2022 the board of directors declared a dividend of 58 per common share payable on march 15 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 1 2022 

we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement in december 2021 allowing us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 15 billion and expiring in december 2026 

in december 2021 we entered into an unsecured 364day credit agreement to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 10 billion at any time outstanding to replace the 10 billion 364day facility that was originally set to expire in january 2022 

the fiveyear and 364 day credit agreements which had no outstanding borrowings as january 1 2022 contain customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio if an event of default occurs then to the extent permitted the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders letter of credit exposure plus interest the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in these agreements at january 1 2022 

our notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and also contain a change of control provision there are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends we were in compliance with all covenants as of january 1 2022 

the notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our 364day credit facility which expires in december 2022 as well as our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in december 2026 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of select acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

monetization and accounts payable programs 

we have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts extended terms program in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for discrete customers we entered into agreements to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization programs transfers under the monetization programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the monetization programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 11 billion but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the extended terms program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the monetization programs accounts receivable sold of 549 million and 783 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 respectively 

the monetization programs are designed to directly offset the impact the extended terms program would have on the dayssalesoutstanding dso metric that is critical to the effective management of the companys accounts receivable balance and overall working capital current dso levels within north america are consistent with dso levels prior to the execution of the extended term program and monetization programs 

refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable 

we have agreements with third parties accounts payable program to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and if elected sell our payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions participating suppliers may at their sole discretion make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions our goal is to capture overall supplier savings in the form of payment terms or vendor funding and the agreements facilitate the suppliers’ ability to sell payment obligations while providing them with greater working capital flexibility we have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under the 

arrangements however our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers 

refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to accounts payable 

if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms working capital could be negatively impacted additionally working capital could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations for suppliers participating in the accounts payable programs financial institutions may terminate their participation or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity or increase our longterm borrowings 

contractual obligations 

we have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months in addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding longterm debt and notes payable balances our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments income taxes pension and postretirement benefits and unconditional purchase obligations 

a summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of january 1 2022 can be found in note 7 “leases and other commitments” to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

a summary of principal payments for longterm debt as of january 1 2022 can be found in note 8 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

interest payments will be approximately 200 million per year from 2022 through 2026 and approximately 900 million in total from 2027 through the last debt maturity date 

a summary of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of january 1 2022 can be found in notes 10 “pension benefits” and note 11 “nonpension postretirement and postemployment benefits” to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

see note 13 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for discussion of uncertain tax positions 

our unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing advertising and other services as of january 1 2022 unconditional purchase obligations totaled approximately 15 billion approximately 12 billion of these unconditional purchase obligations will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next the 12 months 

as of january 1 2022 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 1 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail

we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur and assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our reporting units with goodwill annually during the fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may instead perform a quantitative impairment test  in our quantitative testing we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value with a reporting unit’s fair value being estimated using market multiples this approach employs market multiples based on either sales or earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for companies that are comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiple approach is close to carrying value we may supplement the fair value determination using discounted cash flows that incorporates assumptions surrounding planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we consider the reporting unit impaired and reduce its carrying value of goodwill such that the reporting unit’s new carrying value is the estimated fair value 

similarly we assess indefinitelife intangible assets impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets annually during the fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual budgeting process we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may instead perform a quantitative impairment test in the quantitative testing we compare an intangible asset’s estimated fair value with its carrying value with the intangible asset’s fair value being determined using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from that asset based on estimates of future sales as well as assumptions surrounding earnings growth rates royalty rates and discount rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at january 1 2022 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 82 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands within this total approximately 20 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived including 17 billion related to trademarks comprised principally of pringles and crackerrelated trademarks the majority of all goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded in our north america reporting unit 

the company currently believes the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to cash flows our impairment testing performed through the fourth quarter of 2021 consisted of qualitative testing for all reporting unit goodwill and all indefinitelived intangible assets except for one brand for which quantitative testing was performed no heightened risk of impairment of individual intangible assets or reporting units was identified 

we have 184 million at january 1 2022 related to one brand in the north america operating segment that primarily relates to snack category products in performing the quantitative test of this brand fair value was determined using a relief from royalty valuation method that includes estimates and significant assumptions of future cash flows to be generated from that asset based on estimates of future sales royalty rate and discount rate consistent with rates used by market participants we determined the fair value of this brand exceeds its carrying value and no heightened risk of impairment exists for the asset 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we finalized a decision to reorganize part of our north america operating segment including the rx reporting unit effective at the beginning of fiscal 2021 the reorganization further integrated the rx business with the rest of the north american business and changed internal reporting provided to the segment manager as a result of these changes we reevaluated our north american reporting units and determined that effective at the beginning of fiscal 2021 the rx reporting unit was combined with the north america reporting unit we evaluated the related impacted reporting units for impairment on a before and after basis and concluded that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities with smaller holdings of other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 69 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and a 2021 weightedaverage active management premium of 075 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2021 was 625 equated to approximately the 65th percentile expectation of our model respectively similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 31 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 1 2022 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly decrease or increase 2022 benefits expense by approximately 61 million for the years ended january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by 33 million and 400 million respectively 

pension assets include a level 3 investment comprising 5 of total plan assets as of january 1 2022 the investment a buyin annuity contract is valued based on the calculated pension benefit obligation covered by the contract 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends this year 2020 experience was adjusted to remove the estimated impact of covid19 claims no adjustment was made to 2021 claims our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends kellogg’s 5year average claims inflation has been in the vicinity of 500 in recent years our initial trend rate for 2022 of 525 reflects the expectation that there may still be some additional impacts of the covid19 pandemic that have not yet been reflected including continued upward pressure on trends due to the return of deferred care ongoing covid19 associated costs and increased prices driven by investment in the healthcare system to prepare for the next epidemic our initial rate remains flat for three years before trending downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2021 claims experience was approximately 44 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize in 2019 the society of actuaries soa published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale in 2021 the soa released an updated improvement scale that incorporates an additional year of data in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of 2021 fiscal yearend we used the 2019 soa tables with collar adjustments based on kellogg’s current population consistent with the prior year in addition based on mortality information available from the social security administration and other sources we developed assumptions for future mortality improvement in line with our expectations for future experience the change to the mortality assumption increased the yearend pension and postretirement benefit obligations by 15 million and 5 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe and in the united kingdom the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove government backed bonds we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at january 1 2022 a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2022 benefits expense by approximately 8 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 207 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions during 2021 we recognized a net actuarial gain of approximately 164 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 151 million in 2020 the total net gain recognized in 2021 was driven by a gain of approximately 197 million of plan experience and assumption changes including increases in the discount rate partially offset by a 33 million loss from lower than expected asset returns 

during 2021 we made contributions in the amount of 4 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 16 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

management monitors the company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future 

future outlook 

the company issued its initial financial guidance for 2022 specifically in spite of continued economywide supply challenges the residual impact of the us cereal labor strike and further acceleration in cost inflation the company is projecting 

organic net sales growth of approximately 3 led by pricemix growth 

currencyneutral adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 12 

currencyneutral adjusted earnings per share to increase by approximately 12 

net cash provided by operating activities of approximately 1718 billion with capital expenditure of about 06 billion as a result cash flow is expected to be in the 1112 billion range 

excluded from this guidance are any significant supply chain or other prolonged market disruptions related to the pandemic or global economy 

reconciliation of nongaap guidance measures 

we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of marktomarket adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions interest rates return on assets and commodity prices similarly because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of foreign currency translation 

  

as a result these impacts are not included in the guidance provided therefore we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these nongaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company 

see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from nongaap guidance for 2022 



 2022 full year guidance for net sales operating profit and earnings per share are provided on a nongaap basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company these items for 2022 include impacts of marktomarket adjustments for pension plans service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded commodity contracts certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available 

 represents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items using weightedaverage statutory tax rates depending upon the applicable jurisdiction 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 14 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 

additionally volatile market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira russian ruble and egyptian pound and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro 

we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments including cross currency swaps at yearend 2021 was 42 billion representing a settlement receivable of 35 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2020 was 43 billion representing a settlement obligation of 33 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities foreign currency contracts generally mature within 18 months and cross currency contracts mature with the related debt assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have decreased by 247 million resulting in a net settlement obligation of 212 million at yearend 2021 and the settlement obligation would have increased by 272 million at yearend 2020 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

on december 31 2021 the london interbank offered rates libor was discontinued libor will be phased out completely by june 30 2023 and replaced by the secured overnight financing rate sofr we will have exposure to libor for existing interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts through the phase out period interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts entered into after december 31 2021 will be based on sofr 

we entered into interest rate swaps and in some instances terminated interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar and euro notes the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2021 was 28 billion representing a settlement receivable of 4 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2020 was 26 billion representing a settlement receivable of 46 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 13 million and 8 million at yearend 2021 and 2020 respectively 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

additionally certain ingredients packaging and other goods and services have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and inflationary pressures and we expect these supply pressures and market disruptions to continue into 2022 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2021 was 360 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 1 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2020 was 314 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 8 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by 31 million at yearend 2021 and the settlement receivable would become a settlement obligation of approximately 22 million at yearend 2020 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 collateral related to reciprocal collateralization agreements and margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments were immaterial

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business 

the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows  the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic is uncertain and rapidly changing measures enacted by authorities and actions taken by the company to mitigate the spread of the covid19 pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and shutdowns have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the covid19 pandemic and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities as a result of illness government restrictions or other workforce disruptions or absenteeism or reductions in capacity utilization levels could result in us incurring additional direct costs and experiencing lost revenue illness travel restrictions or workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business the covid19 pandemic could disrupt our supply chain operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our brokers or distributors these disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs or cause delays or inability to deliver products to our customers we have experienced temporary disruptions to our supply chain in certain markets that to date have not been material to our consolidated results these disruptions to our work force and supply could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows further we have delayed certain capital and innovation projects due to the covid19 pandemic continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period could result in additional delays or modifications to these projects and other productivity capital and innovation projects and hinder our ability to achieve the project objectives 

the covid19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty including inflation interest rates availability of capital markets consumer spending rates and energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges we expect the covid19 pandemic may result in lower revenues in some of our emerging market countries that have a higher concentration of traditional trade outlets such as small familyrun stores 

the duration and significance of this sustained demand is uncertain although our business has benefited from some of these measures volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

• consumers may shift purchases to more generic lowerpriced or other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns which could result in a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings adversely affecting the results of our operations 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic could result in delays or modifications to our strategic plans and initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our objective to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

• a strengthening in the us dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses 

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of illness or government restrictions or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work 

• an increased reliance on our information technology systems due to many employees working remotely causing us to be increasingly subject to cyberattack 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing warehousing or distribution facilities or disruption in our supply chain including but not limited to as a result of illness government restrictions or other workforce disruptions 

• an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to among other things reduced instore visits and travel restrictions 

• decreased demand for our products due to unemployment as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• volatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact our result of operations and our commodity hedging activities might not sufficiently offset this volatility 

• volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially impact our pension costs and required pension contributions and 

• increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and commercial paper markets could limit our access to our preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section such as those relating to our reputation brands product sales results of operations or financial condition the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic is uncertain rapidly changing and depends on events beyond our knowledge or control we might not be able to anticipate or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results as a result the impact of the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management  we are utilizing formal revenue growth management practices to help us realize price in a more effective way this approach addresses price strategy pricepack architecture promotion strategy mix management and trade strategies revenue growth management involves changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers consumers or third party providers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits in addition the complexity of the execution requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers any failure to execute revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands  we have a number of iconic brands with significant value promoting and protecting the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we or any of our employees or agents have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences the products becoming unavailable to consumers or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products whether or not valid including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity in addition due to our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers consume food products and their desire for premium or value offerings provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences accordingly we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts or use datadriven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message the growing use of social and digital media platforms by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands our products or any of our employees or agents on social or digital media platforms could seriously damage our brands reputation and brand loyalty regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns marketing programs and sponsorships as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations warehousing and distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters water availability fires or explosions terrorism political unrest government restrictions mandates or shutdowns tariffs and other trade restrictions cybersecurity breaches health pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers their suppliers or our contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information technology production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

in addition we experienced increased demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and were at times unable to fill all customer orders short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives  our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we have recently delayed the implementation of system upgrades and certain other costsaving and productivity initiatives due to the covid19 pandemic continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our cost savings and productivity initiatives on the same timelines 

structural and organizational risks 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses  from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local laws and regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including 

diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the divestiture the divestiture of selected cookie fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cone businesses consummated on july 28 2019 the divested business may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits the divestiture may adversely affect our business and there are execution risks associated with our continued provision of transition services to the divested business to the extent we undertake divestitures in the future we may face additional risks related to such activity for example risks related to our ability to find appropriate buyers to execute transactions on favorable terms to separate divested businesses from our remaining operations and to effectively manage any transitional service arrangements any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business  we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals including individuals with ecommerce digital marketing and data analytics capabilities we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented personnel any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who terminate their employment or become ill as a result of covid19 or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results  additionally changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

risks related to our industry 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities packaging fuel and labor  agricultural commodities including corn wheat rice potato flakes vegetable oils sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy regulation andor shutdown import and export requirements including tariffs global geopolitical conditions drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change a pandemic illness such as the covid19 outbreak or other unforeseen circumstances specifically certain ingredients packaging and other goods and services have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source such materials and services in the future we expect these supply pressures and market disruptions to continue into 2021 to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn such as the covid19 pandemic which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share food processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity oil natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane andor oil storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy regulation andor shutdown war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our results may be adversely affected by increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels  we rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver incoming ingredients to our manufacturing locations and to deliver finished products to our customers  shortages of truck 

drivers and railroad workers have contributed to increased freight costs which has had a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  in 2020 the cost of distribution decreased due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs driven by excess availability warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs however we have experienced a recent increase in transportation and logistics costs in particular compliance with the electronic device logging mandate has increased the cost of transportation for us and many other companies  transportation costs are further increasing as a result of high levels of longhaul driver turnover and increased railroad traffic and service issues  additionally energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry we face competition across our product lines including snacks readytoeat cereals and other convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions the principal aspects of our business where we face competition include brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space navigating the growing ecommerce marketplace convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and customer service most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do our competition with other companies in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences 

in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or consumer preferences more quickly than us category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

the changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels could negatively impact our sales and profits  our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 19 of consolidated net sales during 2020 comprised principally of sales within the united states no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2020 during 2020 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 51 of us net sales there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers have sought and may continue to seek in the future to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms such consolidation can continue to adversely impact our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

additionally alternative retail channels such as ecommerce retailers including as a result of the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers subscription services discount and dollar stores directtoconsumer brands drug stores and club stores have continued to grow this trend away from traditional retail grocery and towards such channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be negatively impacted in particular substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may 

negatively affect our sales or profits in addition these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation affecting our large retail and wholesale customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases also if these alternative retail channels such as ecommerce retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes  there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced loyalty reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products  we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products however the covid19 pandemic has altered and in some cases delayed product innovation efforts while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the companys existing products the companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

competition against private label brands could negatively impact our business  in nearly all of our product categories we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations  climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets  adverse changes such as these could i unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water ii disrupt production schedules and our ability or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers to manufacture or distribute our products iii reduce crop size or quality iv disrupt the retail operations of our customers or v unfavorably impact the demand for or the consumers ability to purchase our products 

there is an increased focus by foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions energy policies and sustainability including single use plastics this new or increased focus may result in new or increased laws and regulations that could cause significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

risks related to our operations 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition  our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business  we participate in “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability payments and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability one of the multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions  increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation an increase in participants enrolled the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

from time to time we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates ibors and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor libor or the london interbank offered rate is expected to be phased out after 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate once libor ceases to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties although we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this transition given our current mix of fixed and variablerate debt our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

we utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital  if the extension of payment terms are reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation our ability to maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted  our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of offering extended customer payment terms we entered into agreements to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization programs in addition in combination with extending supplier payment terms we have agreements with third parties accounts payable program to offer structured payables programs to our suppliers which enable suppliers at their sole discretion to enter bilateral agreements to sell company payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions 

if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms working capital could be negatively impacted additionally working capital could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations for suppliers participating in the accounts payable program financial institutions may terminate their participation or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity or increase our longterm borrowings 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks  as of january 2 2021 we had total debt of approximately 75 billion and total kellogg company equity of 31 billion our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including i impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade ii a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm credit rating would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue increase our commercial paper borrowing costs or both iii restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business iv requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions paying dividends repurchasing shares marketing and other spending and expansion of our product offerings v and causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased 

competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and other intangibles while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of january 2 2021 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment 

as of january 2 2021 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 83 billion of which 58 billion was goodwill and 25 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 180 billion and total kellogg company equity of 31 billion 

risks related to regulations and litigation 

we face risks related to tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes  the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions including shifts in the geopolitical landscape tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax reform” and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances during the third quarter of 2019 swiss federal and zurich cantonal events took place that resulted in enacted tax law changes “swiss tax reform” the new legislation is intended to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures we will continue to monitor swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination food borne illnesses spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies legal and 

regulatory systems can change quickly as demonstrated by brexit  in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic regulatory or social events in addition the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling sustainability of packaging including plastics import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products 

the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory reforms changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation 

modifications to international trade policy including the ratification of the united statesmexicocanada agreement changes in the european union such as brexit or the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas or trade barriers on key commodities with other countries most significantly china could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve including as a result of related uncertainty and could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows higher duties on existing tariffs or additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we are not able to offset 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks  our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our intellectual property and technology 

technology failures cyber attacks privacy breaches or data breaches could disrupt our operations reputation and negatively impact our business  we increasingly rely on information technology systems and third party service providers including through the internet to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to 

increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of many of our employees working remotely updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control including but not limited to network or hardware failures malicious or disruptive software unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors cyberattacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or socialactivist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters a pandemic illness such as covid19 failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events 

moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes social engineering attacks unauthorized access attempts password theft physical breaches employee or inside error malfeasance and cyber or phishingattacks cyber threats are constantly evolving are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions such as the maintenance of an information security program that includes updating our technology and security policies insurance employee training and monitoring and routinely testing our information technology systems to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information the company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the company’s existing and future technology systems in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 each of which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements in addition regulations to implement portions of the ccpa have not been finalized and could significantly impact ccpa compliance measures our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws including the gdpr and ccpa may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time 

if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches issues with or errors in system maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication or other incident involving one of the companys vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability and government investigations which may adversely affect the companys results of operations andor financial condition the misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and the company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems in addition if the companys suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the companys supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the companys business operations we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative 

functions to thirdparty service providers including cloudbased service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally  we are a global company and generated 43 and 42 of our net sales for 2020 and 2019 respectively outside the united states we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include i compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as ofac trade sanction regulations and antiboycott regulations ii compliance with anticorruption laws including the fcpa and uk bribery act ukba iii compliance with antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes iv changes in tax laws interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes v fluctuations or devaluations in currency values especially in emerging markets vi changes in capital controls including currency exchange controls government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the united states vii changes in local regulations and laws the lack of wellestablished reliable andor impartial legal systems in certain countries in which we operate and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in such jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources viii laws relating to information security privacy including the gdpr cashless payments and consumer protection ix uncertainty relating to brexit and its impact on the local and international markets the flow of goods and materials across borders and political environments x discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies xi challenges associated with crossborder product distribution xii increased sovereign risk such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments xiii varying abilities to enforce intellectual property contractual and other legal rights xiv greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles xv loss of ability to manage our operations in certain markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses xvi design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base xvii imposition of more or new tariffs quotas trade barriers price controls and similar restrictions in the countries in which we or our suppliers or manufacturers operate or regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales and xviii changes in trade policies and trade relations 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest and government shutdowns civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political or social uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability  continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these 

factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2021 for example the continuing uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic brexit and international trade disputes as well as ongoing terrorist activity may adversely impact global stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which our common shares are traded and general global economic conditions all of these factors are outside of our control but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets 

our performance is affected by general economic political and social conditions and taxation policies  customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises including the covid19 pandemic recession financial and credit market disruptions government shutdowns or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic political and social conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency trade policy political and social unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business  the economic political and social conditions resulting from brexit and the uncertainty regarding the postbrexit trade agreement as defined below in the transition period and beyond among other events may adversely impact our overall performance 

deteriorating economic conditions in our major markets affected by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition such deterioration in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition in addition significant covid19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products could adversely impact our operations and results 

financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and as a result we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable causing our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results  we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates for example as a result of the united kingdom’s termination of membership in the european union under new trade and cross border operating agreements there could be significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

the united kingdoms exit from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business  the decision of the united kingdom to exit from the european union and the uncertainty concerning the postbrexit trade agreement may have a negative effect on global 

economic conditions financial markets and our business on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the united kingdom officially left the european union on january 31 2020 and entered into a transition period that expired on december 31 2020 during which the united kingdom and the european union negotiated a postbrexit trade agreement the “postbrexit trade agreement” the ultimate effects of brexit on us will depend on the effects of the postbrexit trade agreement which went into effect on january 1 2021 

the uncertainty concerning the postbrexit trade agreement and the united kingdom’s legal political and economic relationship with the european union may be a source of instability in the international markets create significant currency fluctuations andor otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar crossborder cooperation arrangements whether economic tax fiscal legal regulatory or otherwise  we may also face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of brexit including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the united kingdom and european union that could have an adverse effect on our operations for example the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the european union on behalf of its members which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in the european union and the european economic area more difficult any of these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

potential impacts to our business include i reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the united kingdom and other countries that could impact our ability to have sufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers ii requirement to increase inventory levels maintained in both the united kingdom and other countries to ensure adequate supply of product to support both base and promotional activities normally executed with our customers iii increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers iv significant financial impact resulting from tariffs that are implemented between the united kingdom and other countries as the location of our european production facilities and the markets we sell in regularly require significant import and export shipments involving the united kingdom and v our ability to realize future benefit from other assets on our balance sheet such as deferred tax assets may be impacted which could result in additional valuation allowances or reserves being established 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions inclusive of class action lawsuits and foreign litigation including under general commercial employment environmental data privacy or security intellectual property food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting our rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs furthermore actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us as a result we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations

employee health and safety 

the health and safety of our employees is our top priority as a result the company has designed and implemented a number of actions across the business from the outset of the pandemic the company restricted travel and visitors to its facilities prohibited external group meetings and established quarantine procedures for any potentially exposed employees the company subsequently required employees who could do so to work remotely to further minimize the exposure of our employees to covid19 at this time most of our office employees continue to work remotely for those who are not able to work remotely the company implemented new protocols at all of our facilities to protect our employees including temperature checks social distancing response plans face coverings contact tracing enhanced sanitation procedures and additional personal protection equipment

restructuring programs 

we view our restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a three to fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

during 2019 the company announced a reorganization plan for the european reportable segment designed to simplify the organization increase organizational efficiency and enhance key processes since inception the project has resulted in cumulative pretax net charges of approximately 37 million including certain noncash credits cash costs are approximately 50 million the total charges include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to relocation pension curtailment gains third party legal and consulting fees and contract termination costs during 2020 the company recorded total net charges of 1 million related to this initiative with 7 million recorded in sga expense and 8 million recorded in oie this project is substantially complete as of the end of fiscal year 2020 total charges and cash costs were in line with expectations 

also during 2019 the company announced a reorganization plan which primarily impacts the north america reportable segment the reorganization plan is designed to simplify the organization that supports the remaining north america reportable segment after the divestiture and related transition since inception the overall project resulted in cumulative pretax charges of approximately 23 million cash costs approximated the pretax charges total charges include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to third party consulting fees during 2020 the company recorded total charges of 2 million related to this initiative during 2020 this project is substantially complete as of the end of fiscal year 2020 total charges and cash costs were in line with expectations 

in addition to the projects discussed above during 2020 the company incurred restructuring costs in each of its reportable segments related to various reorganization and simplification initiatives and supply chain optimization projects the company recorded total charges of 28 million related to these initiatives including 6 million in cogs and 22 million in sga expense these costs primarily relate to severance and other termination benefits 

project k 

as of the end of 2019 the company completed implementation of all project k initiatives total project charges aftertax cash costs and annual savings delivered by project k were in line with expectations 

cumulatively project k resulted in total pretax charges of approximately 16 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments of approximately 12 billion 

annual cost savings generated from project k are approximately 700 million these savings were realized primarily in selling general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from gotomarket business model changes the overall savings profile of the project reflects our gotomarket initiatives that will impact both selling general and administrative expense and gross profit cost savings have been utilized to offset inflation and fund investments in areas such as instore execution sales capabilities including adding sales representatives and in the design and quality of our products we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

refer to note 5 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

interest expense was 281 million and 284 million for the years ended january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 respectively debt redemption costs included within interest expense for the years ended january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 totaled 20 million and 16 million respectively interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for both periods the decrease from the prior year is due primarily to lower average debt outstanding 

interest income recorded in other income expense net was 21 million and 24 million for the years ended january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 respectively 

income taxes 

our reported effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 202 and 246 respectively 

the 2020 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the reversal of a liability for uncertain tax positions of 32 million resulting from the finalization of a tax examination during the third quarter the reserves were related to the companys estimate of the transition tax liability in conjunction with the finalization of accounting under staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act 

the 2019 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a permanent basis difference in the assets sold to ferrero as well as an outofperiod correction during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded an outofperiod adjustment to correct an error in the tax rate applied to a deferred tax asset arising from an intellectual property transfer in a prior year the adjustment increased income tax expense and decreased deferred tax assets by 39 million respectively we determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 28 2019 and related prior annual and quarterly periods 

adjusted effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 and were 222 and 195 respectively

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory rates additionally the rate could be impacted by tax legislation and if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 

brexit 

the united kingdom uk left the european union on january 31 2020 following the conclusion of the transition period on december 31 2020 the uk exited the european unions custom union and single market moving onto trading terms consistent with the euuk trade and cooperation agreement specific operational and financial impacts of brexit continue to evolve and uncertainty remains relating to its impact on local and international markets and the flow of goods and materials across borders while we do not expect such impacts to be material to the financial trends of our european and consolidated businesses we continue to monitor and evaluate potential impacts including the following 

• net sales could be negatively impacted by reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the united kingdom and other countries resulting in insufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers 

• cost of goods sold could increase due to increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers 

• divergence in implementation of regulatory requirements or disagreements on the trade terms between the european union and the uk could result in unexpected delays negatively impacting our ability to service customers in a timely and costeffective manner 

liquidity and capital resources 

at this time the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and we anticipate current cash and operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other financing sources including commercial paper credit and bond markets will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs we expect cash provided by operating activities of 16 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 500 million in 2021 we currently have 29 billion of unused revolving credit agreements including 15 billion effective through january 2023 and 10 billion effective through january 2022 as well as continued access to the commercial paper markets we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants and do not have material uncertainty about our ability to maintain compliance in future periods we continue to utilize available capacity within the monetization programs to maintain financial flexibility without negatively impacting working capital additionally we utilized certain aspects of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act to delay the employer share of certain us payroll taxes until 2021 and 2022 our utilization does not include a government loan and is not expected to result in any restrictions on the company’s decisions on executive compensation payment of dividends or share buyback programs as the impact of covid19 on the economy and our operations evolves we will continue to assess our liquidity needs our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables the impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting  these programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management 

we periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms to the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms we may seek to adjust our terms including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate supplier payment term modifications did not have a material impact on our cash flows during 2020 and are not expected to have a material impact in 2021 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts 

we had negative working capital of 18 billion and 13 billion as of january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 respectively 

in conjunction with the july 28 2019 closing of the sale of selected cookies fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately 13 billion in cash aftertax proceeds of 

approximately 10 billion were used to redeem outstanding debt which reduced our leverage and provides additional financial flexibility for future operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing including commercial paper will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

net cash provided by our operating activities for 2020 totaled 1986 million compared to 1176 million in the prior year the increase is due primarily to increased profitability and lower cash outflows related to restructuring and business realignment 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is approximately negative 11 days and negative 5 days for 2020 and 2019 respectively core working capital in 2020 averaged 12 of net sales compared to 17 in 2019 the improvement from the prior year is due primarily to improvement in the number of days of trade payables outstanding which results from a decrease in charges related to prior restructuring activity 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 32 million and 28 million for the years ended january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2022 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2021 of approximately 25 million actual 2021 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available over time for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2020 totaled 585 million compared to cash provided of 774 million in 2019 the decrease is due primarily to proceeds from the sale of selected cookies fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately 13 billion in cash in the prior year 

capital spending in 2020 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure including manufacturing capacity expansions in multiple markets and categories and initiatives targeting waste reductions and productivity improvements 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 37 and 43 in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

financing activities 

our net cash used in financing activities was 1388 million and 1905 for 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in cash used is due primarily to the issuance of 500 million of tenyear notes in may 2020 

total debt was 75 billion and 79 billion at yearend 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the following table reflects net debt amounts 



in may of 2020 we issued 500 million of tenyear 210 notes due 2030 resulting in net proceeds after 

debt discount of 496 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including 

the payment of offering related fees and expenses repayment of a portion of the 600 million 400 notes due 

2020 upon maturity and repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions as well as a change of control provision 

in december of 2020 we redeemed 198 million of our 3250 senior notes due 2021 and 358 million of our 3125 senior notes due 2022 additionally the remaining balance of the 600 million 400 notes due 2020 was redeemed upon maturity 

in august 2019 we redeemed 191 million of our 415 us dollar notes due november 2019 248 million of our 400 us dollar notes due 2020 202 million of our 325 us dollar notes due 2021 and 50 million of our 265 us dollar notes due 2023 in september 2019 we redeemed 309 million of our 415 us dollar notes due november 2019 the remaining principal balance subsequent to the august redemption 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 228 per share in 2020 versus 226 per share in 2019 on february 19 2021 the board of directors declared a dividend of 57 per common share payable on march 15 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 2 2021 

we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement in january 2018 allowing us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 15 billion and expiring in january 2023 

in january 2021 we entered into an unsecured 364day credit agreement to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 10 billion at any time outstanding to replace the 10 billion 364day facility that expired in january 2021 

the fiveyear and 364 day credit agreements which had no outstanding borrowings as january 2 2021 contain customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio if an event of default occurs then to the extent permitted the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders letter of credit exposure plus interest the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in these agreements at january 2 2021 

our notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and also contain a change of control provision there are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends we were in compliance with all covenants as of january 2 2021 

the notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our 364day credit facility which expires in january 2022 as well as our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in january 2023 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of select acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

monetization and accounts payable programs 

we have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts extended terms program in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for discrete customers we entered into agreements to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization programs transfers under the monetization programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the monetization programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 1033 million but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the extended terms program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the monetization programs accounts receivable sold of 783 million and 774 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 respectively 

the monetization programs are designed to directly offset the impact the extended terms program would have on the dayssalesoutstanding dso metric that is critical to the effective management of the companys accounts receivable balance and overall working capital current dso levels within north america are consistent with dso levels prior to the execution of the extended term program and monetization programs 

refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable 

we have agreements with third parties accounts payable program to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and if elected sell our payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions participating suppliers may at their sole discretion make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions our goal is to capture overall supplier savings in the form of payment terms or vendor funding and the agreements facilitate the suppliers’ ability to sell payment obligations while providing them with greater working capital flexibility we have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements however our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers 

refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to accounts payable 

if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms working capital could be negatively impacted additionally working capital 

could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations for suppliers participating in the accounts payable programs financial institutions may terminate their participation or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity or increase our longterm borrowings 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at january 2 2021 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 2 2021 



a includes interest payments on our longterm debt and payments on our interest rate swaps interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of january 2 2021 

b the total expected cash payments on our finance leases include interest expense totaling less than 1 million over the periods presented above 

c operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

d purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing advertising and other services the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at yearend 2020 nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans but are not obligated to incur therefore it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 

e as of january 2 2021 our total liability for uncertain tax positions was 65 million of which 19 million scheduled to be paid in the next twelve months we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining 46 million 

f other longterm obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at yearend 2020 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements multiemployer plans and supplemental employee retirement benefits the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2026 as follows 202143 202241 202339 202441 202539 202650 

in addition 80 million of insurance loss reserves and 24 million of tax repatriation payable are expected to be paid over the next four and seven years respectively are included in the total above 

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 05 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at january 2 2021 we have property plant and equipment of 37 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2020 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples of sales if applicable andor earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at january 2 2021 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 83 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands within this total approximately 21 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived including 17 billion related to trademarks comprised principally of pringles and crackerrelated trademarks the majority of all goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded in our north america reporting unit the company currently believes the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to cash flows through impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 no heightened risk of impairment of individual intangible assets or reporting units was identified 

additionally the company has goodwill of 373 million at january 2 2021 related to the rx reporting unit in performing the quantitative test of goodwill for rx fair value was determined based on a calculation which gave consideration to an income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method and the market approach using the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods the significant assumptions utilized within the rx discounted cash flow method are forecasted net sales and profitability growth and the discount rate the company determined the fair value of rx exceeds the carrying value and no heightened risk of impairment exists for the reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 management finalized a decision to reorganize part of its north america operating segment including the rx reporting unit effective at the beginning of fiscal 2021 the reorganization further integrates the rx business with the rest of the north american business and changes internal reporting provided to the segment manager as a result of these changes the company has reevaluated its north american reporting units and determined that effective at the beginning of fiscal 2021 the rx reporting unit will be combined with the north america reporting unit the company evaluated the related impacted reporting units for impairment on a before and after basis and concluded that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities with smaller holdings of other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 70 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and a 2020 weightedaverage active management premium of 080 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2020 was 70 equated to approximately the 64th percentile expectation of our model respectively similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 30 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 2 2021 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly decrease or increase 2021 benefits expense by approximately 63 million for the years ended january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by 400 million and 730 million respectively 

pension assets include a level 3 investment comprising 5 of total plan assets as of january 2 2021 the investment a buyin annuity contract is valued based on the calculated pension benefit obligation covered by the contract 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends this year 2020 experience has been excluded from the averages since it has been influenced by covid19 claims and care deferral as a result of restrictions on elective care therefore we are comparing to a fouryear average 20162019 our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fouryear 

compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 502 our initial trend rate for 2021 of 500 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2020 claims experience was approximately 37 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize in 2019 the society of actuaries soa published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale in 2020 the soa released an updated improvement scale that incorporates an additional year of data in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of 2020 fiscal yearend we used the 2019 soa tables with collar adjustments based on kellogg’s current population consistent with the prior year in addition based on mortality information available from the social security administration and other sources we developed assumptions for future mortality improvement in line with our expectations for future experience the change to the mortality assumption decreased the yearend pension and postretirement benefit obligations by 14 million and 04 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe and in the united kingdom the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove government backed bonds we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at january 2 2021 a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2021 benefits expense by approximately 9 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 181 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions during 2020 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 151 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 94 million in 2019 the total net loss recognized in 2020 was driven by a loss of approximately 551 million of plan experience and assumption changes including decreases in the discount rate partially offset by a 400 million gain from better than expected asset returns 

during 2020 we made contributions in the amount of 8 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 24 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

management monitors the company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future 

future outlook 

the company issued its initial financial guidance for 2021 specifically the company is projecting 

organic net sales to decrease by approximately 1 as it compares against unusually strong covidrelated growth in the prior year 

currencyneutral adjusted operating profit to decline approximately 2 as it compares against unusually strong covidrelated growth and a 53rd week of business in the prior year 

currencyneutral adjusted earnings per share to increase by approximately 1 

net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be approximately 16 billion with capital expenditures of approximately 05 billion as a result nongaap cash flow is expected to be approximately 11 billion 

excluded from this guidance are any significant supply chain or other prolonged market disruptions related to the pandemic or global economy 

reconciliation of nongaap guidance measures 

we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of marktomarket adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions interest rates return on assets and commodity prices similarly because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of foreign currency translation 

  

as a result these impacts are not included in the guidance provided therefore we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these nongaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company 

see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from nongaap guidance for 2021 



 2021 full year guidance for net sales operating profit and earnings per share are provided on a nongaap basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company these items for 2021 include impacts of marktomarket adjustments for pension plans service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded commodities and certain foreign currency contracts the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available 

 represents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items using weightedaverage statutory tax rates depending upon the applicable jurisdiction 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 14 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 

additionally volatile market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira russian ruble and egyptian pound and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations including argentina can impact our results and financial guidance effective july 1 2018 we have accounted for argentina as a highly inflationary economy as the projected threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100 accordingly our argentina subsidiary will use the us dollar as its functional currency accordingly changes in the value of the argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our pesodenominated net monetary asset position is recorded in income at the time of the change net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos were not material as of january 2 2021 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations specifically within the united kingdom and europe as a result of the uks exit from the european union on january 31 2020 the united kingdom left the european union following the conclusion of the transition period on december 31 2020 the united kingdom exited the european unions custom union and single market moving on to trading terms consistent with the european union  united kingdom trade and cooperation agreement while the specific operational and financial impacts of brexit will continue to evolve and uncertainty remains relating to brexit and its impact on the local and international markets and the flow of goods and materials across borders we do not expect such impacts to be material to the financial trends of our european and consolidated businesses we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments including cross currency swaps at yearend 2020 was 43 billion representing a settlement obligation of 33 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2019 was 42 billion representing a settlement receivable of 79 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities foreign currency contracts generally mature within 18 months and cross currency contracts mature with the related debt assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by 272 million resulting in a net settlement obligation of 305 million at yearend 2020 and the settlement receivable would have decreased by 245 million at yearend 2019 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward 

interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

we entered into interest rate swaps and in some instances terminated interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar and euro notes refer to note 8 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2020 was 26 billion representing a settlement receivable of 46 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2019 was 19 billion representing a settlement obligation of 6 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 8 million and 13 million at yearend 2020 and 2019 respectively 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2020 was 314 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 8 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2019 was 524 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 8 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement receivable would become a settlement obligation of 22 million at yearend 2020 and the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 40 million at yearend 2019 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of january 2 2021 collateral related to reciprocal collateralization agreements and margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments were immaterial as of december 28 2019 we were not required to post collateral and collected approximately 19 million of collateral in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2019 we posted 12 million in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local laws and regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the divestiture the divestiture of selected cookie fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cone businesses consummated on july 28 2019 the divested business may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits the divestiture may adversely affect our business and there are execution risks associated with our continued provision of transition services to the divested business 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management 

we are utilizing formal revenue growth management practices to help us realize price in a more effective way this approach addresses price strategy pricepack architecture promotion strategy mix management and trade strategies revenue growth management involves changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers consumers or third party providers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits in addition the complexity of the execution requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers any failure to execute revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat rice potato flakes vegetable oils sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy regulation andor shutdown import and export requirements including tariffs global geopolitical conditions drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings also sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share 

cereal processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy regulation andor shutdown war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our results may be adversely affected by increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels 

we rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver incoming ingredients to our manufacturing locations and to deliver finished products to our customers shortages of truck drivers and railroad workers have contributed to increased freight costs which has had a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular  compliance with the electronic device logging mandate has increased the cost of transportation for us and many other companies transportation costs are further increasing as a result of high levels of longhaul driver turnover and increased railroad traffic and service issues additionally energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution and costs to purchase our products from suppliers increases in transportation and energy and fuel costs has and may continue to affect our profitability and may increase the cost of our products which may reduce consumer demand 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to 

year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability payments and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability one of the multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we withdrew from two multiemployer pension plans in 2019 and recorded an estimate of the related withdrawal liability while this is our best estimate of the ultimate cost of withdrawing from the plans at this time we have not yet reached agreement on the ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability as a result the actual cost could differ from our estimate based on final funding assessments 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including snacks readytoeat cereals and other convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions the principal aspects of our business where we face competition include brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space navigating the growing ecommerce marketplace convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and customer service most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do our competition with other companies in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy our sales and market share will decrease resulting in reduced profitability if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longlasting or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences 

in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or consumer preferences more quickly than us category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

the changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 19 of consolidated net sales during 2019  comprised principally of sales within the united states no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2019  during 2019  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 50 of us net sales there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers have sought and may continue to seek in the future to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

additionally alternative retail channels such as ecommerce retailers including as a result of the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers subscription services discount and dollar stores directtoconsumer brands drug stores and club stores have become more prevalent this trend away from traditional retail grocery and towards such channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be negatively impacted in particular substantial growth in ecommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the expanding presence of ecommerce retailers has impacted and may continue to impact consumer preferences and market dynamics which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits in addition these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases also if these alternative retail channels such as ecommerce retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we or any of our employees have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences the products becoming unavailable to consumers or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products whether or not valid including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity in addition due to our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers consume food products and their desire for premium or value offerings provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences accordingly we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts or use datadriven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands our products or any of our employees on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands reputation and brand loyalty regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns marketing programs and sponsorships as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions including shifts in the geopolitical landscape tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes recently enacted us tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination food borne illnesses spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations warehousing and distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters fires or explosions terrorism political unrest government shutdowns tariffs and other trade restrictions cybersecurity breaches health pandemics disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers their suppliers or our contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information technology production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies legal and regulatory systems can change quickly as demonstrated by the events of the brexit vote in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic regulatory or social events in addition the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling sustainability of packaging including plastics import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment 

and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products 

the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory reforms changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation further modifications to international trade policy including the expected ratification of the united statesmexicocanada agreement changes in the european union such as brexit or the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas or trade barriers on key commodities could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve including as a result of related uncertainty and could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates for example the announcement and implementation of brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions inclusive of class action lawsuits and foreign litigation including under general commercial employment environmental data privacy or security intellectual property food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting our rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced loyalty reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of 

existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the companys existing products the companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect 

our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation an increase in participants enrolled the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

from time to time we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates ibors and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors such as libor will continue to be available after 2021 if certain ibors cease to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

we utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital if the extension of payment terms are reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation our ability to maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions we utilize thirdparty financing programs to offset the negative impact of offering extended customer payment terms in addition in combination with extending supplier payment terms structured payables programs are available to our suppliers which enable suppliers at their sole discretion to enter bilateral agreements to sell company payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions 

changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these third party financing programs less attractive to the financial institutions purchasing trade accounts receivables and company payment obligations thereunder and these financial institutions may seek to terminate their participation in the event of such termination or if our extended payment terms are reversed our ability to effectively manage core working capital could be adversely impacted 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks as of december 28 2019  we had total debt of approximately 79 billion and total kellogg company equity of 27 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic political and social conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic political and social conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency trade policy political and social unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business the economic political and social conditions resulting from brexit among other events may adversely impact our overall performance 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented personnel any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any 

key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results additionally changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 28 2019  the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 84 billion of which 58 billion was goodwill and 26 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 175 billion and total kellogg company equity of 27 billion 

competition against private label brands could negatively impact our business 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures cyber attacks privacy breaches or data breaches could disrupt our operations reputation and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems and third party service providers including through the internet to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control including but not limited to network or hardware failures malicious or disruptive software unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors cyberattacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or socialactivist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events 

moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes social engineering attacks unauthorized access attempts password theft physical breaches employee or inside error malfeasance and cyber or phishingattacks cyber threats are constantly evolving are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide 

range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions such as the maintenance of an information security program that includes updating our technology and security policies insurance employee training and monitoring and routinely testing our information technology systems to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information the company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the company’s existing and future technology systems i n addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 each of which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements additionally our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws including the gdpr and ccpa may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time 

if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches issues with or errors in system maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication or other incident involving one of the companys vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability and government investigations which may adversely affect the companys results of operations andor financial condition the misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws the company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems in addition if the companys suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the companys supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the companys business operations we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers including cloudbased service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products our technology or any other form of intellectual property or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products or operations in addition if in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly such finding could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 42 and 40 of our net sales for 2019 and 2018 respectively outside the united states we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest and government shutdowns civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political or social uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2020 for example the continuing uncertainty related to the future trading relationship between the united kingdom and the european union arising from the brexit referendum and international trade disputes as well as ongoing terrorist activity may adversely impact global stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which our common shares are traded and general global economic conditions all of these factors are outside of our control but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets 

the results of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

following the result of a referendum in 2016 the united kingdom left the european union on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as brexit pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the united kingdom and european union the united kingdom will be subject to a transition period until december 31 2020 the “transition period” during which time european union rules will continue to apply negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the united kingdom and the european union following the expiration of the transition period 

the uncertainty concerning the united kingdom’s legal political and economic relationship with the european union after the transition period may be a source of instability in the international markets create significant currency fluctuations andor otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar crossborder cooperation arrangements whether economic tax fiscal legal regulatory or otherwise we may also face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of brexit including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the united kingdom and european union that could have an adverse effect on our operations for example the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the european union on behalf of its members which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in the european union and the european economic area more difficult any of these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

potential impacts to our business include i reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the united kingdom and other countries that could impact our ability to have sufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers ii requirement to increase inventory levels maintained in both the united kingdom and other countries to ensure adequate supply of product to support both base and promotional activities normally executed with our customers iii increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers iv significant financial impact resulting from tariffs that are implemented between the united kingdom and other countries as the location of our european production facilities and the markets we sell in regularly require significant import and export shipments involving the united kingdom v our ability to realize future benefit from other assets on our balance sheet such as deferred tax assets may be impacted which could result in additional valuation allowances or reserves being established 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets adverse changes such as these could 

 

there is an increased focus by foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions  energy policies and sustainability including single use plastics this new or increased focus may result in new or increased laws and regulations that could cause significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial

interest expense was 284 million and 287 million for the years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for both periods the slight decrease from the prior year is due primarily to interest savings related to the debt redemption and the impact of a favorable settlement of taxrelated interest partially offset by debt redemption costs

the 2018 effective tax rate benefited from an 11 million net reduction of income tax expense related to our adoption of us tax reform the favorable impact of discretionary pension contributions totaling 250 million which were designated as 2017 tax year contributions and a 44 million discrete tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of deferred taxes following a legal entity restructuring

the impact to the financial trends of our european and consolidated businesses resulting from the future trading relationship between the united kingdom and the european union will continue to be monitored and evaluated over the course of 2020 during 2019 we generated approximately 5 of our net sales and hold approximately 3 of consolidated assets in the united kingdom as of december 28 2019 as details of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union are finalized we will continue to evaluate the impacts to our business brexit may impact our future financial trends in areas such as 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables the impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting  core working capital was improved by the extension of supplier payment terms these programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts 

we had negative working capital of 13 billion and 14 billion as of december 28 2019 and december 29 2018  respectively 

in conjunction with the july 28 2019 closing of the sale of selected cookies fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately 13 billion in cash aftertax proceeds of approximately 10 billion were used to redeem outstanding debt which reduced our leverage and provides additional financial flexibility for future operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing including commercial paper will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2019 totaled 1176 million a decrease of 360 million as compared to 2018 the decrease was due primarily to the current year impact of the divestiture including related taxes paid and restructuring costs and the yearoveryear impact of accounts receivable partially offset by lower pension contributions 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is approximately negative 5 and negative 6 days for 2019 and 2018 respectively core working capital in 2019 averaged 17 of net sales compared to 24 in 2018 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 28 million and 287 million for the years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively the 2018 contributions included 250 million of pretax discretionary contributions to us plans designated for the 2017 tax year 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2022 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2020 of approximately 26 million actual 2020 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available over time for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



investing activities 

our net cash provided by investing activities for 2019 totaled 774 million compared to cash used of 948 million in 2018  the change was due primarily to the divestiture of selected cookies fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately 13 billion of cash as well as our acquisition of an ownership interest in tolaram africa foods pte ltd taf for 381 million during 2018 

capital spending in 2019 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure including new plants in emerging markets network optimization and packaging flexibility in global manufacturing and distribution 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 43 in both 2019 and 2018 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 1905 million and 566 million for the years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively 

total debt was 79 billion and 89 billion at yearend 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in august 2019 the company redeemed 191 million of its 415 us dollar notes due november 2019 248 million of its 400 us dollar notes due 2020 202 million of its 325 us dollar notes due 2021 and 50 million of its 265 us dollar notes due 2023 in september 2019 the company redeemed 309 million of its 415 us dollar notes due november 2019 the remaining principal balance subsequent to the august redemption 

in may 2018 we issued 600 million of tenyear 430 senior notes due 2028 and 400 million of threeyear 325 senior notes due 2021 resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 994 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of our 400 million sevenyear 325 us dollar notes due 2018 at maturity and the repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings used to finance our acquisition of ownership interests in taf and multipro 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 226 per share in 2019 total cash paid for dividends increased by 27 in 2019 on february 21 2020 the board of directors declared a dividend of 57 per common share payable on march 16 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 3 2020 

we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement in january 2018 allowing us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 15 billion and expiring in january 2023 

in january 2020 we entered into an unsecured 364day credit agreement to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 10 billion at any time outstanding to replace the 10 billion 364day facility that expired in january 2020 

the fiveyear and 364 day credit agreements which had no outstanding borrowings as december 28 2019 contain customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio if an event of default occurs then to the extent permitted the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders letter of credit exposure plus interest 

during the third quarter of 2019 in connection with the divestiture of selected cookies fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses the company withdrew from two multiemployer pension plans and recorded withdrawal liabilities of 132 million while this represents our best estimate of the cost of withdrawing from the plans at this time we have not yet reached agreement on the ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability subsequent to the end of the year the company and the lenders under the fiveyear and 364day credit agreements entered into a waiver agreement addressing any matters that arose or may arise from these liabilities under the agreements as long as the aggregate amount of such liabilities does not exceed 250 million the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in these agreements at december 28 2019  

our notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and also contain a change of control provision there are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 28 2019 

the notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our 364day credit facility which expires in january 2021 as well as our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in january 2023 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of select acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

monetization and accounts payable programs 

we have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts extended terms program in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for discrete customers we entered into agreements to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization programs transfers under the monetization programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the monetization programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 1033 million but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the extended terms program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the monetization programs accounts receivable sold of 774 million and 900 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively 

the monetization programs are designed to directly offset the impact the extended terms program would have on the dayssalesoutstanding dso metric that is critical to the effective management of the companys accounts receivable balance and overall working capital current dso levels within north america are consistent with dso levels prior to the execution of the extended term program and monetization programs 

refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable 

additionally we have agreements with third parties accounts payable program to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and if elected sell our payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions participating suppliers may at their sole discretion make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions our goal is to capture overall supplier savings in the form of payment terms or vendor funding and the agreements facilitate the suppliers’ ability to sell payment obligations while providing them with greater working capital flexibility we have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements however our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers 

refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to accounts payable 

if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization or accounts payable programs working capital could be negatively impacted in addition a downgrade in our credit rating could result in higher costs to participating accounts payable programs suppliers or our extended payment terms being reversed the latter of which could negatively impact working capital if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity or increase our longterm borrowings 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 28 2019  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2019  



 in addition 80 million of insurance loss reserves and 26 million of tax repatriation payable are expected to be paid over the next four and seven years respectively are included in the total above 

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 28 2019  we have property plant and equipment of 36 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2019 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples of sales if applicable andor earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

on december 30 2018 the company reorganized our north american business the reorganization eliminated the legacy business unit structure and internal reporting in addition the company changed the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker codm and segment manager as a result the company reevaluated its operating segments and reporting units 

in addition we transferred the management of our middle east north africa and turkey businesses from kellogg europe to kellogg amea effective december 30 2018 

refer to note 4  goodwill and other intangibles and note 17  reportable segments for further details on these changes 

as a result of these changes in operating segments and related reporting units the company reallocated goodwill between reporting units where necessary and compared the carrying value to the fair value of each impacted reporting unit on a before and after basis this evaluation was only required to be performed on reporting units impacted by the changes noted above 

effective december 30 2018 in north america the previous us snacks us morning foods us specialty channels us frozen foods kashi canada and rx operating segments are now a single operating segment kellogg north america at the beginning of 2019 the company evaluated the related impacted reporting units for impairment on a before and after basis and concluded that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values 

approximately 46 million of goodwill was reallocated between the impacted reporting units within kellogg europe and kellogg amea related to the transfer of businesses between these operating segments the company performed a goodwill evaluation of the impacted reporting units on a before and after basis and concluded that the fair value of the impacted reporting units exceeded their carrying values 

additionally during the first quarter of 2019 the company determined that it was more likely than not that the company would be selling selected cookies fruit and fruitflavored snacks pie crusts and ice cream cones businesses within the north america reporting unit as a result the company performed a goodwill impairment evaluation on the north america reporting unit in the first quarter of 2019 and concluded that the fair value 

exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit during the second quarter of 2019 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the businesses to ferrero the sale was completed during the third quarter of 2019 and resulted in the divestiture of the net assets and liabilities of these businesses included in the north america reporting unit including 191 million of goodwill and 765 million of net intangibles in addition to the cash consideration received the company entered into a perpetual royaltyfree licensing agreement with ferrero allowing kellogg the use of certain brand names for cracker products the license agreement was fair valued at 18 million and recorded as an indefinitelived intangible asset 

at december 28 2019  goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 84 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands originally associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 21 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived including 17 billion related to trademarks comprised principally of pringles and crackerrelated trademarks the majority of these intangible assets are recorded in our north america reporting unit the company currently believes the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to cash flows through impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 no heightened risk of impairment of individual intangible assets or reporting units was identified 

additionally the company has goodwill of 606 million and 373 million at december 28 2019 related to the multipro and rx reporting units respectively the company performed additional goodwill impairment testing for multipro using both an ebitda market multiple and discounted cash flow method the company performed additional goodwill impairment testing for rx using both a sales market multiple and discounted cash flow method significant assumptions utilized within the multipro discounted cash flow model include forecasted net sales growth and gross margin the significant assumption utilized within the rx discounted cash flow model is forecasted net sales growth the company determined the fair value of multipro and rx exceed the carrying value and no heightened risk of impairment exists for the reporting units 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities with smaller holdings of other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 72 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and a 2019 weightedaverage active management premium of 093 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2019 was 75 prior to the midyear remeasurement and 70 after the midyear 

remeasurement based on an updated target portfolio mix with an active management premium of 080 net of fees equated to approximately the 53rd percentile and 54th percentile expectation of our model respectively similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 28 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 28 2019  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2020 benefits expense by approximately 64 million for the years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by 730 million and 845 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 512 our initial trend rate for 2020 of 525 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 28 2019  a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2020 benefits expense by approximately 3 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 7 million a one percent increase in 2020 health care claims cost over that projected from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 7 million and would increase 2020 expense by 03 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2019 claims experience was approximately 15 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize in 2019 the society of actuaries soa published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale the expectations of future mortality rates in the new soa tables were consistent with prior kellogg mortality assumptions in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of 2019 fiscal yearend we adopted the new soa tables with collar adjustments based on kellogg’s current population in addition based on mortality information available from the social security administration and other sources we developed assumptions for future mortality improvement in line with our expectations for future experience the change to the mortality assumption impacted the yearend pension and postretirement benefit obligations by 77 million and 13 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable and in the uk the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove government backed bonds we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 28 2019  a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2020 benefits expense by approximately 8 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 238 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions during 2019 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 94 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 346 million in 2018 the total net loss recognized in 2019 was driven by a 730 million gain from better than expected asset returns offset by a loss of approximately 824 million of plan 

experience and assumption changes including decreases in the discount rate and the change in mortality assumptions during 2019 we also recognized curtailment gains of 19 million related to benefit changes and certain events affecting our benefit programs 

during 2019 we made contributions in the amount of 10 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 18 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

management monitors the company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act includes a provision designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income gilti starting in 2018 under the provision a us shareholder is required to include in gross income the amount of its gilti which is 50 of the excess of the shareholder’s net tested income of its controlled foreign corporation over the deemed tangible income return the amount of gilti included by a us shareholder is computed by aggregating all controlled foreign corporations cfc shareholders are allowed to claim a foreign tax credit for 80 percent of the taxes paid or accrued with respect to the tested income of each cfc subject to some limitations

future outlook 

the company issued its initial financial guidance for 2020 specifically the company is projecting 

organic net sales to increase by 12 

currencyneutral adjusted operating profit to decline approximately 4 as the absence of the results from the divested businesses more than offsets growth in the base business 

currencyneutral adjusted earnings per share to decline by approximately 34 as the absence of results from the divested businesses more than offset growth in the base business 

nongaap operating cash flow to improve to 0910 billion 

we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of marktomarket adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions interest rates return on assets and commodity prices similarly because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of foreign currency translation 

  

as a result these impacts are not included in the guidance provided therefore we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these nongaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company 

see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from nongaap guidance for 2020 

 2020 full year guidance for net sales operating profit and earnings per share are provided on a nongaap basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company these items for 2020 include impacts of marktomarket adjustments for pension plans service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded commodities and certain foreign currency contracts the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 14 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira russian ruble and egyptian pound and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations including argentina can impact our results and financial guidance effective july 1 2018 we have accounted for argentina as a highly inflationary economy as the projected threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100 accordingly our argentina subsidiary will use the us dollar as its functional currency accordingly changes in the value of the argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our pesodenominated net monetary asset position is recorded in income at the time of the change net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos were not material as of december 28 2019 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations specifically within the united kingdom and europe as a result of the uks exit from the european union we expect this uncertainty to continue over 2020 as negotiations evolve regarding the future trading relationship we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the negotiation of a trade deal with the european union and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments including cross currency swaps at yearend 2019 was 42 billion representing a settlement receivable of 79 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2018 was 31 billion representing a settlement receivable of 78 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities foreign currency contracts generally mature within 18 months and cross currency contracts mature with the related debt assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have decreased by 245 million resulting in a net settlement obligation of 166 million at yearend 2019 and the settlement obligation would have increased by 199 million at yearend 2018  these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2019 and 2018  we entered into interest rate swaps and in some instances terminated interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar and euro notes refer to note 8 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2019 was 19 billion representing a settlement obligation of 6 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2018 was 16 billion representing a settlement obligation of 5 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 13 million and 22 million at yearend 2019 and 2018  respectively 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2019 was 524 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 8 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2018 was 417 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 6 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by 40 million at yearend 2019  and the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 34 million at yearend 2018  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount we were not required to post collateral as of december 28 2019 and collected approximately 19 million of collateral at december 28 2019 in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in other liabilities net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2018 we were not required to post collateral and collected approximately 20 million of collateral in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2019 and december 29 2018  we posted 12 million and 18 million respectively in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local laws and regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the proposed divestiture of our cookies and fruit snacks businesses is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all 

on november 12 2018 we announced our intention to explore a sale of our cookies business including the keebler  famous amos  mother’s  and murray  brands fruit snacks business including the stretch island  brand and our pie crust and ice cream cone businesses there can be no assurance of the terms timing or structure of any transaction involving such businesses whether we will be able to identify buyers for the businesses on favorable terms or at all or whether any such transaction will take place at all in addition any such transaction is subject to risks and uncertainties including unanticipated developments regulatory approvals or clearances and uncertainty in the financial markets that could delay or prevent the completion of any such transaction 

the proposed divestiture of our cookies and fruit snacks businesses may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

executing the proposed divestiture of our cookies fruit snacks pie crust and ice cream cone businesses will require us to incur costs and will require the time and attention of our senior management and key employees which could distract them from operating our business disrupt operations and result in the loss of business opportunities each of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we may also experience increased difficulty in attracting retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the divestiture and following its completion which could harm our business even if the proposed divestiture is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the divestiture and the divestiture may in fact adversely affect our business 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global efficiency and effectiveness program project k 

in november 2013 the company announced a global efficiency and effectiveness program project k while we are in the final year of project k and many of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion we may not be able to conclude project k as planned events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable any failure to conclude project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management 

we are utilizing formal revenue growth management practices to help us realize price in a more effective way this approach addresses price strategy pricepack architecture promotion strategy mix management and trade strategies revenue growth management involves changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers consumers or third party providers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits in addition the complexity of the execution requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers any failure to execute revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat potato flakes vegetable oils sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy regulation andor shutdown drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the 

distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy regulation andor shutdown war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our results may be adversely affected by increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels 

we rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver incoming ingredients to our manufacturing locations and to deliver finished products to our customers shortages of truck drivers and railroad workers have contributed to increased freight costs which has had a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations transportation costs are further increasing as a result of high levels of longhaul driver turnover and increased railroad traffic and service issues additionally energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution and costs to purchase our products from suppliers increases in transportation and energy and fuel costs has and may continue to affect our profitability and may increase the cost of our products which may reduce consumer demand 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans 

then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet there is the potential that the sale of our cookies fruit snacks pie crust and ice cream cone businesses may result in withdrawal liability under certain multiemployer pension plans and any such withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including snacks readytoeat cereals and other convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions the principal aspects of our business where we face competition include brand recognition taste nutritional value price promotion innovation shelf space navigating the growing ecommerce marketplace convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and customer service most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do our competition with other companies in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

the changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 19 of consolidated net sales during 2018  comprised principally of sales within the united states no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2018  during 2018  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 49 of us net sales there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers have sought and may continue to seek in the future to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

additionally alternative retail channels such as internetbased retailers mobile applications subscription services discount and dollar stores drug stores and club stores have become more prevalent this trend away from traditional retail grocery and towards such channels is expected to continue in the future if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be negatively impacted in addition these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases also if these alternative retail channels such as internetbased retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we or any of our employees have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences the products becoming unavailable to consumers or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products whether or not valid including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity in addition we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands our products or any of our employees on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands reputation and brand loyalty regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns marketing programs and sponsorships as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions including shifts in the geopolitical landscape tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes recently enacted us tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination food borne illnesses spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of 

products in this category adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations warehousing and distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters fires or explosions terrorism political unrest unrest or government shutdowns cybersecurity breaches health pandemics disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information technology production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies legal and regulatory systems can change quickly as demonstrated by the events of the brexit vote in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic regulatory or social events in addition the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products 

the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory reforms changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation further modifications to international trade policy including changes to or repeal of the north american free trade agreement changes in the european union such as brexit or the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas or trade barriers on key commodities 

could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve including as a result of related uncertainty and could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates for example the announcement and implementation of brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental data privacy or security intellectual property food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting our rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced loyalty demand and price reductions for our brands and products we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the companys existing products the companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect 

our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation an increase in participants enrolled the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however 

the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

we utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital if the extension of payment terms are reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation our ability to maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions we utilize thirdparty financing programs to offset the negative impact of offering extended customer payment terms in addition in combination with extending supplier payment terms structured payables programs are available to our suppliers which enable suppliers at their sole discretion to enter bilateral agreements to sell company payment obligations to designated thirdparty financial institutions 

changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these third party financing programs less attractive to the financial institutions purchasing trade accounts receivables and company payment obligations thereunder and these financial institutions may seek to terminate their participation in the event of such termination or if our extended payment terms are reversed our ability to effectively manage core working capital could be adversely impacted 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity   and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks as of december 29 2018  we had total debt of approximately 94 billion and total kellogg company equity of 26 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic political and social conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic political and social conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political and social unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business the economic political and social conditions resulting from brexit among other events may adversely impact our overall performance 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented personnel any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results additionally changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 29 2018  the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 94 billion of which 61 billion was goodwill and 33 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 178 billion and total kellogg company equity of 26 billion 

competition against retailer brands could negatively impact our business 

in nearly all of our product categories we face branded and pricebased competition our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer brands then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin 

offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures cyber attacks privacy breaches or data breaches could disrupt our operations reputation and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems and third party service providers including through the internet to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control including but not limited to network or hardware failures malicious or disruptive software unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors cyberattacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or socialactivist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events 

moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes social engineering attacks unauthorized access attempts password theft physical breaches employee or inside error malfeasance and cyber or phishingattacks cyber threats are constantly evolving are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions such as the maintenance of an information security program that includes updating our technology and security policies cyber insurance employee training and monitoring and routinely testing our information technology systems to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information i n addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations including with respect to the european union general data protection regulation gdpr which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements additionally our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws including the gdpr may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time 

if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches issues with or errors in system maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication or 

other incident involving one of the companys vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability and government investigations which may adversely affect the companys results of operations andor financial condition the misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws the company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems in addition if the companys suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the companys supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the companys business operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products our technology or any other form of intellectual property or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products or operations in addition if in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly such finding could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 40 37 and 35 of our net sales for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively outside the united states we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 



 please refer to note 16 for more information regarding our operations in venezuela including the impact on our operations from currency restrictions and our decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations effective december 31 2016 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest and government shutdowns civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political or social uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2018 for example the continuing uncertainty arising from the brexit referendum in the united kingdom as well as ongoing terrorist activity may adversely impact global stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which our common shares are traded and general global economic conditions all of these factors are outside of our control but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets 

the results of the united kingdoms referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union and in march 2017 the british government invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union which per the terms of the treaty formally triggered a twoyear negotiation process and puts the united kingdom on a course to withdraw from the european union by the end of march 2019 in january 2019 the draft of the withdrawal agreement that was previously published in november 2018 was rejected by uk parliament if no agreement is concluded by march 29 2019 the united kingdom will leave the european union at such time accordingly the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal 

the economic conditions and outlook in the united kingdom the european union and elsewhere could be further adversely affected by i the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit ii new or modified trading arrangements between the united kingdom and other countries any of these developments or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur could affect economic growth or business activity in the united kingdom or the european union and could result in the relocation of businesses cause business interruptions lead to economic recession or depression and impact the stability of the financial markets availability of credit currency exchange rates compliance risks interest rates financial institutions and political financial and monetary systems any of these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

potential impacts to our business include i reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the united kingdom and other countries that could impact our ability to have sufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers ii requirement to increase inventory levels maintained in both the united kingdom and other countries to ensure adequate supply of product to support both base and promotional activities normally executed with our customers iii increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers iv significant financial impact resulting from tariffs that are implemented between the united kingdom and other countries as the location of our european production facilities and the markets we sell in regularly require significant import and export shipments involving the united kingdom v our ability to realize future benefit from other assets on our balance sheet such as deferred tax assets may be impacted which could result in additional valuation allowances or reserves being established 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets adverse changes such as these could 

 

foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies in the event that such regulation is enacted we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

restructuring and cost reduction activities 

we view our restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a three to fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

project k 

project k is expected to continue generating a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business or utilized to achieve our growth initiatives 

since inception project k has reduced the company’s cost structure and is expected to provide enduring benefits including an optimized supply chain infrastructure an efficient global business services model a global focus on categories increased agility from a more efficient organization design and improved effectiveness in gotomarket models these benefits are intended to strengthen existing businesses in core markets increase growth in developing and emerging markets and drive an increased level of valueadded innovation 

as of the end of 2018 the company has approved all remaining project k initiatives and implementation of these remaining initiatives will be completed in 2019 project charges aftertax cash costs and annual savings remain in line with expectations 

we currently anticipate that project k will result in total pretax charges once all phases are implemented of approximately 16 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments estimated to be approximately 12 billion cash expenditures of approximately 1150 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2018 as we complete the implementation of previously approved project k initiatives in 2019 we expect to incur additional charges of approximately 50 million 

we expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately 700 million in 2019 the savings will be realized primarily in selling general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from gotomarket business model changes the overall savings profile of the project reflects our gotomarket initiatives that will impact both selling general and administrative expense and gross profit we have realized approximately 650 million of annual savings through the end of 2018 cost savings have been utilized to offset inflation and fund investments in areas such as instore execution sales capabilities including adding sales representatives reestablishing the kashi business unit and in the design and quality of our products we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

we funded much of the initial cash requirements for project k through our supplier financing initiative and subsequently were able to fund much of the cash costs for the project through cash on hand as we have started to realize cash savings from the project 

we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the adjusted income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis 

refer to note 5  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities 

other projects 

in 2017 the company completed the implementation of a global zerobased budgeting zbb program we have realized annual savings from the zbb program of approximately 450 million through 2018 realized largely in selling general and administrative expense final project charges aftertax cash costs and annual savings were in line with expectations 

in support of the zbb initiative we incurred pretax charges of approximately 3 million and 25 million during 2017 and 2016 respectively total charges of 40 million were recognized related to the implementation of the zbb program which consisted primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

interest expense was in millions 2018 287 2017 256 2016 406 and interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for all periods presented interest expense was higher in 2018 due to the issuance of the 600 million of tenyear 430 senior notes due 2028 and 400 million of threeyear 325 senior notes due 2021 the decrease from 2016 to 2017 was due to a 153 million pretax charge in 2016 to redeem 475 million of 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 the charge consisted primarily of a premium on the tender offer and also included accelerated losses on preissuance interest rate hedges acceleration of fees and debt discount on the redeemed debt and fees 

interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 2018 16 2017 9 2016 5 we currently expect that our 2019  gross interest expense will increase slightly from 2018 due to the issuance of the 600 million of tenyear 430 senior notes due 2028 and 400 million of threeyear 325 senior notes due 2021 issued in may 2018 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code which impacted our year ended december 30 2017 including but not limited to reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be electively paid over eight years and accelerating first year expensing of certain capital expenditures 

shortly after the tax act was enacted the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax act’s impact sab 118 provided a measurement period which in no case should extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date during which a company may complete the accounting for the impacts of the tax act under asc topic 740 

our 2018 income tax provision includes an 11 million reduction to income tax expense due to changes in estimates related to the tax act the reduction is primarily related to a reduction in the transition tax estimate and additional tax associated with the final assessment of changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion and resulting tax 

our 2017 income tax provision includes 8 million of net additional income tax expense during the quarter ended december 30 2017 driven by the reduction in the us corporate tax rate and the transition tax on foreign earnings 

transition tax on foreign earnings the transition tax is a tax on the previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in order to determine the amount of the transition tax the company must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 earnings and profits ep of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings ep is similar to 

retained earnings of the subsidiary but requires other adjustments to conform to us tax rules as of december 30 2017 based on accumulated foreign earnings and profits of approximately 26 billion which are primarily in europe we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a transition tax obligation of 157 million which we elected to pay over eight years in the third quarter of 2018 we recorded a 16 million reduction to the transition tax liability and tax expense based on updated estimates of ep during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company as part of completing its accounting under sab 118 revised its estimate of the transition tax liability to 94 million and recorded 47 million of tax reserves related to uncertainty in our interpretation of the statute and associated regulations 

indefinite reinvestment assertion prior to the tax act we treated a significant portion of our undistributed foreign earnings as indefinitely reinvested in light of the tax act which included a new territorial tax regime as of the period ended december 30 2017 management determined that the company would analyze its global capital structure and working capital strategy and considered the indefinite reinvestment assertion to be provisional under sab 118 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we finished analyzing our global capital structure and working capital strategy and determined that 24 billion of foreign earnings as of december 30 2017 were no longer considered to be indefinitely invested accordingly income tax expense of 5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 we have completed our assessment and accounting under sab 118 for our indefinite investment assertion 

in conjunction with sab 118 we have completed the accounting for the tax act in the fourth quarter 2018 

our reported effective tax rates for 2018  2017  and 2016  were 136 248 and 252 respectively adjusted effective tax rates for 2018  2017  and 2016  were 165 258 and 247 respectively 

the 2018 effective income tax rate benefited from the reduction of the us corporate tax rate as well as an 11 million reduction of income tax expense due to a changes in estimates related to the tax act the impact of discretionary pension contributions totaling 250 million in 2018 which were designated as 2017 tax year contributions and a 44 million discrete tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of deferred taxes following a legal entity restructuring 

for the year ended december 30 2017 the effective tax rate benefited from a deferred tax benefit of 39 million resulting from the intercompany transfer of intellectual property the 2016 effective income tax rate benefited from excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation totaling 36 million refer to note 13  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

brexit 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union and in march 2017 the british government invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union which per the terms of the treaty formally triggered a twoyear negotiation process and puts the united kingdom on a course to withdraw from the european union by the end of march 2019 with no agreement concluded as yet the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal 

the impact to the financial trends of our european and consolidated businesses resulting from brexit is currently being evaluated during 2018 we generated approximately 5 of our net sales and hold approximately 3 of consolidated assets in the united kingdom as of december 29 2018 as details of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union are finalized in march 2019 we will continue to evaluate the impacts to our business brexit may impact our future financial trends in areas such as 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables the impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization and securitization programs which are designed to effectively offset the impact of extended terms are included in our calculation of core working capital    core working capital was improved by the extension of supplier payment terms these programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts 

we had negative working capital of 14 billion as of december 29 2018  and december 30 2017  

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 29 2018  and december 30 2017  we had 252 million and 204 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our international earnings to the us which may be subject to additional taxes 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 totaled 1536 million an increase of 11 billion as compared to 2017 the increase was due primarily to the termination of our accounts receivable securitization program at the end of 2017 collections of deferred purchase price on securitized trade receivables totaled 1243 million in 2017 versus zero in the current year additionally cash provided by operating activities benefited by lower tax cash payments due primarily to us tax reform these yearoveryear benefits were partially offset by the pretax discretionary pension contribution of 250 million in 2018 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 totaled 403 million a decrease of 868 million as compared to 2016 the decrease was due primarily to the difference in yearoveryear utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program entered into in july 2016 collections of deferred purchase price on securitized trade receivables totaled 1243 million in 2017 versus 501 million in 2016 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is approximately negative 6 days for 2018 and 2017 respectively core working capital in 2018 averaged 24 of net sales compared to 29 in 2017 and 40 in 2016 in 2017 both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier terms initiative days of trade receivables and inventory on hand were flat in 2017 compared to 2016 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 287 million 44 million and 33 million in 2018  2017  and 2016 respectively the 2018 contributions included 250 million of pretax discretionary contributions to us plans designated for the 2017 tax year 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2022 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2019 of approximately 25 million actual 2019 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2018  totaled 948 million an increase of 11 billion compared with 2017  the increase was due primarily to the 2018 acquisition of an ownership interest in tolaram africa foods pte ltd for 381 million and the yearoveryear impact of collections of deferred purchase price on securitized trade receivables during 2017 this program was terminated at the end of 2017 additionally we acquired chicago bar co llc the manufacturer of rxbar for 596 million in 2017 

in 2016 we acquired parati a manufacturer of biscuit powdered beverage and pasta brands in brazil for 381 million 

capital spending in 2018 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure network optimization and packaging flexibility in global manufacturing and distribution 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 43 in 2018 and 39 in both 2017 and 2016 

in november 2018 the company announced that it will begin to explore the potential sale of the cookie fruit snacks pie crust and ice cream cone businesses these businesses are primarily reported as part of the us snacks us specialty and north america other reportable segments and represent approximately 900 million in net sales for the year ended december 29 2018 if the divestiture occurs we expect to use the proceeds to reduce debt for opportunistic share repurchases or potential future acquisitions 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 566 million 604 million and 786 million for 2018  2017 and 2016 respectively 

total debt was 89 billion and 86 billion at yearend 2018 and 2017 respectively 

in may 2018 we issued 600 million of tenyear 430 senior notes due 2028 and 400 million of threeyear 325 senior notes due 2021 resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 994 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of our 400 million sevenyear 325 us dollar notes due 2018 at maturity and the repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings used to finance our acquisition of ownership interests in taf and multipro 

in november 2017 we issued 600 million of tenyear 34 senior notes to pay down commercial paper issued in conjunction with the purchase of chicago bar co llc manufacturer of rxbar 

in may 2017 we issued €600 million of fiveyear 080 euro notes due 2022 and repaid our 175 fixed rate 400 million us dollar notes due 2017 at maturity additionally we repaid our 205 fixed rate cdn 300 million canadian dollar notes at maturity 

in november 2016 we issued 600 million of sevenyear 265 us dollar notes and repaid our 1875 500 million us dollar notes due 2016 at maturity 

in may 2016 we issued €600 million of eightyear 100 euro notes due 2024 and repaid our 445 fixed rate 750 million us dollar notes due 2016 at maturity 

in march 2016 we issued 750 million of tenyear 325 us dollar notes and 650 million of thirtyyear 450 us dollar notes also in march 2016 we redeemed 475 million of our 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 at a pretax cash cost of 144 million 

in december 2017 the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 15 billion in shares beginning in 2018 through december 2019 during 2018 we purchased 5 million shares totaling 320 million during 2017 we purchased 7 million shares totaling 516 million during 2016 we purchased 6 million shares totaling 426 million 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 220 per share in 2018 212 per share in 2017 and 204 per share in 2016 total cash paid for dividends increased by 35 in 2018 and 40 in 2017 on february 22 2019 the board of directors declared a dividend of 56 per common share payable on march 15 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 5 2019 

we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement in january 2018 allowing us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 15 billion and expiring in january 2023 

in january 2019 we entered into an unsecured 364day credit agreement to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 10 billion at any time outstanding to replace the 10 billion 364day facility that expired in january 2019 the new credit facilities contains customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio if an event of default occurs then to the extent permitted the administrative agent may terminate the commitments under the credit facility accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreement and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders letter of credit exposure plus interest there are no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facilities 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our 364day credit facility which expires in january 2020 as well as our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in january 2023 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 2018  we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of select acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

monetization and securitization programs 

during 2016 we initiated a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts extended terms program in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for discrete customers we entered into agreements to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization programs transfers under the monetization programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the monetization programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 1033 million increased from 800 million from december 30 2017 reflecting the execution of a second monetization program during 2018 but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the extended terms program and as financial institutions move in or out of the monetization programs accounts receivable sold of 900 million and 601 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 respectively 

if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization programs and we were unable secure alternative arrangements our ability to offer our extended terms program and effectively manage our accounts receivable balance and overall working capital could be negatively impacted 

previously in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for certain customers we entered into agreements with financial institutions securitization program to sell these receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time was 600 million in december 2017 we terminated the securitization program such that no receivables were sold after december 28 2017 in march 2018 we substantially replaced the securitization program with a second monetization program 

as of december 30 2017 approximately 433 million of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program remained outstanding for which we received cash of approximately 412 million and a deferred purchase price asset of approximately 21 million

at december 29 2018  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for information on our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 29 2018  



 in addition the total remaining tax repatriation payable of 80 million which is expected to be paid over the next 7 years is included in the total above 

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 29 2018  we have property plant and equipment of 37 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2018 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on sales if applicable andor earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at december 29 2018  goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 94 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 28 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks the majority of these intangible assets are recorded in our us snacks reporting unit we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the us snacks reporting unit was approximately 62 and 57 in 2018 and 2017 respectively however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses 

on november 12 2018 we announced that we would be exploring the sale of our cookies business including the keebler famous amos mothers and murray brands fruit snacks business including the stretch island brand pie crust and ice cream cone businesses 

additionally we have 207 million of goodwill related to our kashi reporting unit which was primarily a result of establishing kashi as a separate operating segment in 2015 which required an allocation of goodwill from our us 

snacks operating segment the 2018 fair value of the kashi reporting unit was estimated primarily based on a multiple of net sales and discounted cash flows the percentage of excess over fair value was approximately 12 and 9 in 2018 and 2017 respectively using the same methodology on a yearonyear basis the use of modestly different assumptions in the valuation could have resulted in an impairment 

we also have 616 million and 798 million of goodwill and other intangible assets respectively related to our multipro operating segment as a result of the acquisition of this business in may 2018 consistent with our expectations given the recent acquisition the 2018 fair value approximates carrying value for both goodwill and the indefinitely lived assets the use of modestly different assumptions in these valuations could have resulted in an impairment 

factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to 

use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 72 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2018 of 75 equated to approximately the 39th percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 28 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 29 2018  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2019 benefits expense by approximately 57 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2018845 2017415 201684 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic 

components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 498 our initial trend rate for 2019 of 550 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 29 2018  a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2019 benefits expense by approximately 6 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 97 million a one percent increase in 2019 health care claims cost over that projected from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 7 million and would increase 2019 expense by 03 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2018 claims experience was approximately 27 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize at the end of 2014 we revised our mortality assumption after considering the society of actuaries soa updated mortality tables and improvement scale as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of december 29 2018 we considered the soas 2018 updated improvement scale the soas 2018 scale incorporates changes consistent with our view of future mortality improvements established in 2014 therefore we adopted the 2018 soa improvement scale this change to the mortality assumption decreased the yearend us pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 10 million and 2 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable and in the uk the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove government backed bonds we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 29 2018  a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2019 benefits expense by approximately 6 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 201 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur   

despite the previouslydescribed policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions during 2018 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 346 million compared to a net actuarial gain of approximately 126 million in 2017 the total net loss recognized in 2018 was driven by a 845 million loss from worse than expected asset returns offset by a gain of approximately 499 million of plan experience and assumption changes including increases in the discount rate and the change in mortality assumptions during 2018 we also recognized curtailment gains of 30 million related to benefit changes and certain events affecting our benefit programs 

of the total net gain recognized in 2017 approximately 415 million was from better than expected asset returns the gain was offset by a 289 million loss from plan experience and assumption changes including declines in the discount rate which were partially offset by the change in mortality assumptions during 2017 we also recognized curtailment gains of 153 million related to benefit changes and certain events affecting our benefit programs 

during 2018 we made contributions in the amount of 270 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount includes discretionary contributions totaling 250 million designated for the 2017 tax year additionally we contributed 17 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

management monitors the company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act includes a provision designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income gilti starting in 2018 under the provision a us shareholder is required to include in gross income the amount of its gilti which is 50  of the excess of the shareholder’s net tested income of its controlled foreign corporation over the deemed tangible income return the amount of gilti included by a us shareholder is computed by aggregating all controlled foreign corporations cfc shareholders are allowed to claim a foreign tax credit for 80 percent  of the taxes paid or accrued with respect to the tested income of each cfc subject to some limitations 

the fasb staff has indicated that a company should make and disclose a policy election as to whether it will 1 recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as gilti or 2 account for gilti as a period cost if and when incurred during 2018 the company elected to account for the gilti as a period cost and has included an estimate for gilti in its effective tax rate 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  in february 2018 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu permitting a company to reclassify the disproportionate income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 on items within accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the reclassification is optional regardless of whether or not a company opts to make the reclassification the new guidance requires all companies to include certain disclosures in their financial statements the guidance is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we will adopt the asu in the first quarter of 2019 

leases  in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu which will require the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all leases with terms greater than 12 months the distinction between finance leases and operating leases will remain with similar classification criteria as current gaap to distinguish between capital and operating leases the principal difference from current guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current gaap the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted the company will adopt the asu in the first quarter of 2019 and expects to elect certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance additionally the company will elect the optional transition method that allows for a cumulativeeffect adjustment in 

the period of adoption and will not restate prior periods the company continues to evaluate the effect of adoption to its consolidated financial statements and disclosures however the company currently estimates total assets and liabilities will increase approximately 450 million to 500 million upon adoption this estimate could change as the company continues to progress with implementation and will also fluctuate based on the lease portfolio and discount rates as of the adoption date we do not expect a material impact to the company’s consolidated statements of income or cash flows 

cloud computing arrangements  in august 2018 the fasb issued asu 201815 intangibles  goodwill and other  internaluse software customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract the asu allows companies to capitalize implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement including periods covered by renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2019 and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing when to adopt the asu and the impact of adoption 

compensation retirement benefits   in august 2018 the fasb issued asu 201814 disclosure framework—changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans the asu removed disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial clarified the specific requirements of disclosures and added disclosure requirements identified as relevant the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2020 and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing when to adopt the asu and the impact of adoption 

future outlook 

we provide net sales guidance on a currencyneutral basis on this basis we expect currencyneutral net sales to be up 34 in 2019 this includes an additional four months of multipro net sales and an improved organic growth rate of 12 the company expects gradual improvement over the year with balanced contributions from volume and pricemix driven by recent revenuegrowth management actions 

from a profitability standpoint we expect currencyneutral adjusted operating profit to be approximately flat during 2019 the company plans another year of investment in pack formats advertising and capabilities underlying cost inflation is expected to accelerate in 2019 but will largely be offset by productivity savings and revenue growth management actions negative mix and cost impacts from the expansion of alternative pack formats and channels particularly onthego offerings will be a headwind to gross profit margin moderating in the second half 

we expect currencyneutral adjusted eps to decrease in the range of 5 to 7 in 2019 this decline reflects the 2018 discrete tax benefits especially in the first half as well as the impact on oie of the financial markets decline in late 2018 which reduced the value of pension assets entering the new year 

we expect that fullyear nongaap cash flow will be roughly flat compared to the prior year the positive impact of the 2018 voluntary pension contribution is offset by increased tax cash payments and capital expenditures the latter will support growth initiatives including investments in capacity and technology 

additionally due to frontweighted investments and cost pressures and the lapping of discrete tax benefits noted previously we expect to see a doubledigit decline in currencyneutral adjusted eps for the first half of the year with the first quarter down more than the second quarter during the back half of the year we expect to return to growth in both currencyneutral adjusted operating profit and currencyneutral adjusted eps 

we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of marktomarket adjustments costs associated with brexit and business and portfolio realignment because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions interest rates return on assets and commodity prices or future decisions to be made by our management team and board of directors similarly because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of foreign currency translation 

  

as a result these impacts are not included in the guidance provided therefore we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these nongaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company 

see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from nongaap guidance for 2019 

 2019 full year guidance for net sales operating profit and earnings per share are provided on a nongaap basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company these items for 2019 include impacts of brexit costs associated with the business and portfolio realignment and marktomarket adjustments for pension plans service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded commodities and certain foreign currency contracts the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available 

 represents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items using weightedaverage statutory tax rates depending upon the applicable jurisdiction 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 14  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira russian ruble and egyptian pound and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro 

the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations including argentina can impact our results and financial guidance effective july 1 2018 we have accounted for argentina as a highly inflationary economy as the projected threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100 accordingly our argentina subsidiary will use the us dollar as its functional currency accordingly changes in the value of the argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our pesodenominated net monetary asset position is recorded in income at the time of the change net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos are not material as of december 29 2018 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations specifically within the united kingdom and europe as a result of the uk referendum held on june 23 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit as a result of the referendum the british government formally initiated the process for withdrawal in march 2017 in january 2019 the draft of the withdrawal agreement that was previously published in november 2018 was rejected by the uk parliament the terms of withdrawal have not been established if no agreement is concluded by march 29 2019 the united kingdom will leave the european union at such time accordingly the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business 

we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments including cross currency swaps at yearend 2018  was 31 billion representing a settlement receivable of 78 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2017  was 22 billion representing a settlement obligation of 4 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities foreign currency contracts generally mature within 18 months and cross currency contracts mature with the related debt assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have decreased by 199 million resulting in a net settlement obligation of 121 million at yearend 2018  and the settlement obligation would have increased by 71 million at yearend 2017  these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2018  and 2017  we entered into interest rate swaps and in some instances terminated interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar and euro notes refer to note 8  within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2018  was 16 billion representing a settlement obligation of 5 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2017  was 23 billion representing a settlement obligation of 54 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 22 million and 27 million at yearend 2018  and 2017  respectively 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2018  was 417 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 6 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2017  was 544 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 1 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by 34 million at yearend 2018  and the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 41 million at yearend 2017  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount we were not required to post collateral as of december 29 2018  and collected approximately 20 million of collateral at december 29 2018  in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in other liabilities net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2017 we had posted collateral of 20 million 

in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2018  and december 30 2017  we posted 18 million and 17 million respectively in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global efficiency and effectiveness program project k 

in november 2013 the company announced a global efficiency and effectiveness program project k the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the project may not advance our business strategy as expected while we are four years into the implementation of project k and many of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion we may not be able to implement project k as planned including the successful exit of our direct store delivery network and transitioning that business to a warehouse model events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of project k has required and will continue to require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from the adoption of zerobased budgeting 

we adopted zerobased budgeting which presents significant organizational challenges as a result we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiative other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected in addition the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale 

any failure to implement our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management 

we are establishing a more formal revenue growth management discipline to help us realize price in a more effective way this approach addresses price strategy pricepack architecture promotion strategy mix management and trade strategies revenue growth management will involve changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers or consumers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits in addition the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiative these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers any failure to implement revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat potato flakes vegetable oils sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our 

prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans 

then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

the changing retail environment could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20 of consolidated net sales during 2017  comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 30 2017  approximately 17 of our consolidated receivables balance and 26 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2017  during 2017  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 35 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 49 of us net sales there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers have sought and may continue to seek in the future to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

additionally alternative retail channels such as internetbased retailers mobile applications subscription services discount and dollar stores drug stores and club stores have become more prevalent if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be negatively impacted in addition these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases also if these alternative retail channels such as internetbased retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences the products becoming unavailable to consumers or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products whether or not valid including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity in addition we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands reputation and brand loyalty regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns marketing programs and sponsorships as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

the impact of recently enacted tax reform legislation in the us on our business is uncertain 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code which impact our year ended 123017 including but not limited to reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be electively paid over eight years and accelerating first year expensing of certain capital expenditures 

the tax act also introduces new tax laws that may impact our taxable income beginning in 2018 which will include but not limited to the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction generally eliminating us federal income taxes on foreign earnings subject to certain important exceptions a new provision designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income gilti a provision that could limit the amount of deductible interest expense 

limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation creating a base erosion antiabuse tax beat and modifying or repealing many deductions and credits 

the impact of many provisions of the tax act lack clarity and is subject to interpretation until additional internal revenue service guidance is issued the ultimate impact of the act may differ from the company’s estimates due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made as well as any forthcoming regulatory guidance 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions including shifts in the geopolitical landscape tax rates in the us and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes recently enacted us tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the us such international earnings would be subject to us tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell 

products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters fires or explosions terrorism political unrest health pandemics or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events in addition the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products 

the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations governmental and administrative bodies within the us are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory forms changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation further modifications to international trade policy including changes to or repeal of the north american free trade agreement or the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas or trade barriers on key commodities could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve including as a result of related uncertainty and could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates for example the announcement of brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting our rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced loyalty demand and price reductions for our brands and products we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the companys existing products the companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will 

depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect 

our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity   and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks as of december 30 2017  we had total debt of approximately 86 billion and total kellogg company equity of 22 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract recruit train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 30 2017  the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 81 billion of which 55 billion was goodwill and 26 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 164 billion and total kellogg company equity of 22 billion 

competition against retailer brands could negatively impact our business 

in nearly all of our product categories we face branded and pricebased competition our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer brands then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control including but not limited to network or hardware failures malicious or disruptive software unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors cyberattacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or socialactivist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses malware ransonware or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks cyber threats are constantly evolving and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches or other incident involving one of the companys vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability which may adversely affect the companys results of operations andor financial condition the misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws the company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems in addition if the companys suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the companys supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the companys business operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products in addition if in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly such finding could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 37 of our 2017  net sales 35 of 2016 and 37 of our 2015 net sales outside the united states we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 please refer to note 16 for more information regarding our operations in venezuela including the impact on our operations from currency restrictions and our decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations effective december 31 2016 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2018 for example the continuing uncertainty arising from the brexit referendum in the united kingdom as well as ongoing terrorist activity may adversely impact global stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which our common shares are traded and general global economic conditions all of these factors are outside of our control but may nonetheless cause us to 

adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets 

the results of the united kingdoms referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union and in march 2017 the british government invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union which per the terms of the treaty formally triggered a twoyear negotiation process and puts the united kingdom on a course to withdraw from the european union by the end of march 2019 the terms of withdrawal have not been established and the united kingdom will remain a member of the european union until conclusion of the withdrawal agreement if no agreement is concluded within two years of formal notification of withdrawal however then the united kingdom may leave the european union at such time accordingly the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal the referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal 

the economic conditions and outlook in the united kingdom the european union and elsewhere could be further adversely affected by i the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit ii new or modified trading arrangements between the united kingdom and other countries iii the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or iv the risk that the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist any of these developments or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur could affect economic growth or business activity in the united kingdom or the european union and could result in the relocation of businesses cause business interruptions lead to economic recession or depression and impact the stability of the financial markets availability of credit currency exchange rates interest rates financial institutions and political financial and monetary systems any of these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food 

system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets adverse changes such as these could 

 

foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies in the event that such regulation is enacted we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

operating margin expansion through 2018 

in 2016 we announced a plan to increase our currencyneutral comparable operating margin by 350 basis points from 2015 through 2018 excluding the impact of pending accounting changes beginning in the first quarter of 2018 in 2017 currencyneutral comparable operating margin increased 160 basis points as a result of cogs and sga savings realized from project k and zbb initiatives currencyneutral comparable operating margin was 169 for the full year 2017 which is 250 basis points higher than the level recorded for 2015 

during 2018 we expect to realize more than half of the remaining project k savings including savings from our dsd exit and all remaining planned zbb savings these savings are expected to more than offset increased reinvestment in brand building modest input cost inflation and higher transportation costs as a result we are currently on pace to deliver our targeted 3year goal of margin expansion in 2018 excluding the impact of accounting changes

there was a material change in the business environment including a worsening of our access to key raw materials subject to restrictions and a related significant drop in production volume in the fourth quarter these supply chain disruptions along with other factors such as the worsening economic environment in venezuela and the limited access to dollars to import goods through the use of any of the available currency mechanisms have impaired our ability to effectively operate and fully control our venezuelan subsidiary

in addition to the original program’s focus on strengthening existing businesses in core markets increasing growth in developing and emerging markets and driving an increased level of valueadded innovation the extended program also focuses on implementing a more efficient gotomarket model for certain businesses and creating a more efficient organizational design in several markets since inception project k has provided significant benefits and is expected to continue to provide a number of benefits in the future including an optimized supply chain infrastructure the implementation of global business services a new global focus on categories increased agility from a more efficient organization design and improved effectiveness in gotomarket models 

we currently anticipate that project k will result in total pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented of 15 to 16 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments estimated to be approximately 11 billion cash expenditures of approximately 950 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2017 total cash expenditures as defined are expected to be approximately 175 million for 2018 total charges for project k in 2018 are expected to be approximately 75 to 125 million 

we expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately 600 to 700 million in 2019 the savings will be realized primarily in selling general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from gotomarket business model changes the overall savings profile of the project reflects our gotomarket initiatives that will impact both selling general and administrative expense and gross profit we have realized approximately 480 million of annual savings through the end of 2017 cost savings have been utilized to increase margins and be strategically invested in areas such as instore execution sales capabilities including adding sales representatives reestablishing the kashi business unit and in the design and quality of our products we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

we funded much of the initial cash requirements for project k through our supplier financing initiative we are now able to fund much of the cash costs for the project through cash on hand as we have started to realize cash savings from the project 

we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis 

we will complete implementation of project k in 2018 with annual savings expected to increase through 2019 project charges aftertax cash costs and annual savings remain in line with expectations

other projects 

in 2015 we implemented a zerobased budgeting zbb program in our north america business and during the first half of 2016 the program was expanded into our international businesses we have realized annual savings from the zbb program of 397 million through 2017 and expect cumulative savings to be approximately 450 to 500 million by the end of 2018 realized largely in selling general and administrative expense 

in support of the zbb initiative we incurred pretax charges of approximately 3 million 25 million and 12 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively total charges of 40 million have been recognized since the inception of the zbb program which consists primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities 

we completed implementation of the zbb program in 2017 with annual savings expected to increase through 2018 project charges aftertax cash costs and annual savings remain in line with expectations 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real nigerian naira and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

interest expense was lower in 2017 due to a 153 million pretax charge in 2016 to redeem 475 million of 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 the charge consisted primarily of a premium on the tender offer and also included accelerated losses on preissuance interest rate hedges acceleration of fees and debt discount on the redeemed debt and fees also contributing to the increase from 2015 to 2016 was increased weighting of fixed rate debt and higher average debt levels 

interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 2017 9 2016 5 2015 4 we currently expect that our 2018  gross interest expense will increase from 2017 due to the 600 million tenyear 34 senior notes issued in november 2017 in conjunction with our acquisition of chicago bar co llc the manufacturer of rxbar and higher expected interest rates on floating rate debt 

  



income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code which impact our year ended december 30 2017 including but not limited to reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be electively paid over eight years and accelerating first year expensing of certain capital expenditures 

the tax act also introduces new tax laws that may impact our taxable income beginning in 2018 which will include but not limited to the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction generally eliminating us federal income taxes on foreign earnings subject to certain important exceptions a new provision designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income gilti a provision that could limit the amount of deductible interest expense limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation creating a base erosion antiabuse tax beat and modifying or repealing many deductions and credits 

shortly after the tax act was enacted the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax act’s impact sab 118 provides a measurement period which in no case should extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date during which a company acting in good faith may complete the accounting for the impacts of the tax act under asc topic 740 per sab 118 we must reflect the income tax effects of the tax act in the reporting period in which the accounting under asc topic 740 is complete to the extent our accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete we can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects and record a provisional estimate in the financial statements in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined if we cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements we should continue to apply asc 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the tax act being enacted if we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the impacts of the tax act in a reporting period a provisional amount must be recorded in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined 

our year end income tax provision includes 4 million of net additional income tax expense during the quarter ended december 30 2017 driven by the reduction in the us corporate tax rate and the transition tax on foreign earnings 

reduction in us corporate tax rate the tax provision includes a tax benefit of 153 million for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the corporate tax rate reduction impact to our net deferred tax balances this adjustment is considered complete 

transition tax on foreign earnings the transition tax is a tax on the previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in order to determine the amount of the transition tax we must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 earnings and profits ep of the relevant 

subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings ep is similar to retained earnings of the subsidiary but requires other adjustments to conform to us tax rules as of december 30 2017 based on accumulated foreign earnings and profits of approximately 26 billion which are primarily in europe we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a transition tax obligation of 157 million which the company expects to elect to pay over eight years the current portion of 17 million is included in other current liabilities and the remainder is included within other liabilities on the balance sheet however we are awaiting further interpretative guidance continuing to assess available tax methods and elections and continuing to gather additional information in order to finalize our calculations and complete the accounting for the transition tax liability 

in addition to the transition tax the tax act introduced a territorial tax system which will be effective beginning in 2018 the territorial tax system will impact our overall global capital and legal entity structure working capital and repatriation plan on a goforward basis in light of the territorial tax system and other new international provisions within the tax act that are effective beginning in 2018 we are continuing to keep the 26 billion of accumulated foreign earnings and profits in europe and other nonus jurisdictions and we can continue to support our assertion to indefinitely reinvest these foreign earnings and profits as a result as a reasonable provisional estimate we are not recording any new deferred tax liabilities associated with the territorial tax system or for any changes to our indefinite reinvestment assertion further it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax cost for any unrecognized future tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion as of december 30 2017 because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws exchange rates circumstances existing when a repatriation sale or liquidation occurs and other factors 

if there are any changes to our indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of finalizing our assessment of the new tax act we will adjust our provisional estimates record and disclose any tax impacts in the appropriate period pursuant to sab 118 

for the year ended december 30 2017 we did not identify any items from the tax act for which a provisional estimate could not be determined in addition other provisions of the tax act for which we have finalized or are continuing to finalize its accounting are not material or expected to be material to the financial statements as of and for the year ended december 30 2017 

our reported effective tax rates for 2017  2016  and 2015  were 246 252 and 206 respectively comparable effective tax rates for 2017  2016  and 2015  were 258 247 and 256 respectively 

for the year ended december 30 2017 the effective tax rate benefited from a deferred tax benefit of 39 million resulting from the intercompany transfer of intellectual property the 2016 effective income tax rate benefited from excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation totaling 36 million the 2015 effective income tax rates benefited from the marktomarket loss recorded for our pension plans refer to note 13  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

investments in unconsolidated entities 

aftertax earnings from unconsolidated entities for the year ended december 30 2017  increased to 7 million compared to the prior year of 1 million the change was driven by increased sales and favorable tax benefits in multipro singapore pte ltd multipro partially offset by inflation on input costs for both multipro and our other unconsolidated entities net sales attributed to our share of the unconsolidated entities were approximately 377 million for multipro and approximately 28 million for all other unconsolidated entities 

the components of our unconsolidated entities’ net sales growth for 2017 versus 2016 are shown in the following table 



aftertax earnings from unconsolidated entities for the year ended december 31 2016 increased to 1 million compared to the prior year of less than 1 million the change was driven by increased sales in multipro partially offset by the other unconsolidated entities net sales attributed to our share of the unconsolidated entities were approximately 331 million for multipro and approximately 23 million for all other unconsolidated entities 

the components of our unconsolidated entities’ net sales growth for 2016 versus 2015 are shown in the following table 



liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables in addition we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments working capital is also impacted by the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock we had negative working capital of 14 billion and 15 billion as of december 30 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 30 2017  and december 31 2016  we had 204 million and 240 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our international earnings to the us which may be subject to additional taxes the tax act required a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of 

foreign subsidiaries the impact of the tax act provision on repatriation lacks clarity and is subject to interpretation and may ultimately vary from the provision amount reported 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 totaled 1646 million an increase of 18 million as compared to 2016 pretax cash costs totaling 144 million in the year ended december 31 2016 related to the 475 million redemption of our 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 and 59 million cash settlement of forward starting swaps were offset by an increase in tax cash payments during the current year as well as a lower yearoveryear cash flow impact from the supplier financing initiative 

aftertax cash payments related to project k were 230 million in 2017 117 million in 2016 and 191 million in 2015 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is approximately negative 7 days and 3 days for 2017 and 2016 respectively core working capital in 2017 averaged 30 of net sales compared to 40 in 2016 and 62 in 2015 in 2017 both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative days of trade receivables and inventory on hand were flat in 2017 compared to 2016 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 44 million 33 million and 53 million in 2017  2016  and 2015 respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2022 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2018 of approximately 37 million actual 2018 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2017  amounted to 1094 million an increase of 201 million compared with 2016  in 2017 we acquired chicago bar co llc the manufacturer of rxbar for 596 million in 2016 we acquired parati a manufacturer of biscuit powdered beverage and pasta brands in brazil for 381 million 

in 2015 we acquired for 445 million a 50 interest in multipro singapore pte ltd a leading distributor of a variety of food products in nigeria and ghana and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer in addition to our joint venture investment in 2015 we also acquired mass foods and a majority interest in bisco misr 

capital spending in 2017 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and network optimization initiatives in global manufacturing and distribution 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 39 in 2017 39 in 2016 and 41 in 2015 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 604 million 642 million and 706 million for 2017  2016 and 2015 respectively 

total debt was 86 billion and 78 billion at yearend 2017 and 2016 respectively 

in november 2017 we issued 600 million of tenyear 34 senior notes to pay down commercial paper issued in conjunction with the purchase of chicago bar co llc manufacturer of rxbar 

in may 2017 we issued €600 million of fiveyear 080 euro notes due 2022 and repaid our 175 fixed rate 400 million us dollar notes due 2017 at maturity additionally we repaid our 205 fixed rate cdn 300 million canadian dollar notes at maturity 

in november 2016 we issued 600 million of sevenyear 265 us dollar notes and repaid our 1875 500 million us dollar notes due 2016 at maturity 

in may 2016 we issued €600 million of eightyear 100 euro notes due 2024 and repaid our 445 fixed rate 750 million us dollar notes due 2016 at maturity 

in march 2016 we issued 750 million of tenyear 325 us dollar notes and 650 million of thirtyyear 450 us dollar notes also in march 2016 we redeemed 475 million of our 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 

in may 2015 we repaid our 350 million 1125 us dollar notes due 2015 at maturity 

in february 2015 we repaid our floatingrate 250 million us dollar notes due 2015 at maturity and in march 2015 we issued €600 million of tenyear 125 euro notes due 2025 

in december 2015 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 15 billion beginning in 2016 through december 2017 in december 2017 the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 15 billion of our common stock beginning in january 2018 through december 2019 

during 2017 we purchased 7 million shares totaling 516 million during 2016 we purchased 6 million shares totaling 426 million during 2015 we purchased 11 million shares totaling 731 million 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 212 per share in 2017 204 per share in 2016 and 198 per share in 2015 total cash paid for dividends increased by 40 in 2017 and 30 in 2016 on february 16 2018 the board of directors declared a dividend of 54 per common share payable on march 15 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 5 2018 

we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement in february 2014 allowing us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion and expiring in 2019 in january 2018 we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement to replace the existing agreement allowing us to borrow up to 15 billion on a revolving basis 

in january 2018 we entered into an unsecured 364day credit agreement to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 10 billion at any time outstanding to replace the 800 million 364day facility that expired in january 2018 the new credit facilities contains customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio if an event of default occurs then to the extent permitted the administrative agent may terminate the commitments under the credit facility accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreement and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders letter of credit exposure plus interest there are no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facilities 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our 364day credit facility which expires in january 2019 as well as our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in january 2023 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 30 2017  we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

during 2016 we initiated a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts extended terms program 

during the first half of 2016 in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for a discrete customer we entered into an agreement to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions monetization program transfers under the monetization program are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the monetization program provides for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 800 million but may be increased as additional financial institutions are added to the monetization program accounts receivable sold of 601 million and 562 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively approximately 22 billion and 15 billion of accounts receivable have been sold via the monetization program during the years ended december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively 

in addition to the monetization program during 2016 in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for other customers we entered into agreements with financial institutions securitization program to sell these receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 600 million but may be increased as additional financial institutions are added to the agreement as of december 30 2017 approximately 433 million of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program remained outstanding for which we received cash of approximately 412 million and a deferred purchase price asset of approximately 21 million as of december 31 2016 approximately 292 million of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program remained outstanding for which we received cash of approximately 255 million and a deferred purchase price asset of approximately 37 million during the years ended december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 26 billion and 839 million of accounts receivable were sold through the securitization program respectively in december 2017 we terminated the securitization program such that no receivables will be sold after december 28 2017 we terminated the securitization program as a result of declining customer interest in an extendedterms program and recent changes to accounting guidelines that i no longer treat the advances from the securitization in a way that preserves cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditure and ii require burdensome administration including daily reconciliations of receivables sold and collected under the program terminating the securitization program will have no impact on our cash flow

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 30 2017  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for information on our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 30 2017  



 in addition the total tax repatriation payable of 157 million which expected to be paid over the next 8 years is included in the total above 

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 30 2017  we have property plant and equipment of 37 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 22 million of idle assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2017 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on sales if applicable andor earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at december 30 2017  goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 81 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 25 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks the majority of these intangible assets are recorded in our us snacks reporting unit we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the us snacks reporting unit was approximately 57 and 41 in 2017 and 2016 respectively however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses 

additionally we have 207 million of goodwill related to our kashi reporting unit which was primarily a result of establishing kashi as a separate operating segment in 2015 which required an allocation of goodwill from our us snacks operating segment the 2017 fair value of the kashi reporting unit was estimated primarily based on a multiple of net sales and discounted cash flows the percentage of excess over fair value was approximately 30 the use of modestly different assumptions in the valuation could have resulted in an impairment 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to 

use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 71 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2017 of 85 equated to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 29 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 30 2017  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2018 benefits expense by approximately 62 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2017415 201684 2015666 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 519 our initial trend rate for 2018 of 575 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 30 2017  a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2018 benefits expense by approximately 7 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 117 million a one percent increase in 2018 health care claims cost over that projected from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 7 million and would increase 2018 expense by 03 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience loss arising from recognition of 2017 claims experience was approximately 54 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize at the end of 2014 we revised our mortality assumption after considering the society of actuaries soa updated mortality tables and improvement scale as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of december 30 2017 we considered the soas 2017 updated improvement scale the soas 2017 scale incorporates changes consistent with our view of future mortality improvements established in 2014 therefore we adopted the 2017 soa improvement scale this change to the mortality assumption decreased the yearend us pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 21 million and 9 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable and in the uk the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove bonds from issuers where it is not clear if they are truly corporate bonds we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 30 2017  a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2018 benefits expense by approximately 4 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 239 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur   

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions during 2017 we recognized a net actuarial gain of approximately 126 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 307 million in 2016 the total net gain recognized in 2017 was driven by a 415 million gain from better than expected asset returns offset by a loss of approximately 289 million of plan experience and assumption changes including declines in the discount rate which were partially offset by the change in mortality assumptions during 2017 we also recognized curtailment gains of 153 million related to benefit changes and certain events affecting our benefit programs 

of the total net gain recognized in 2016 approximately 393 million was related to assumption changes primarily declines in the discount rate which were partially offset by the change in mortality assumptions the loss was offset by an 84 million gain from better than expected asset returns 

during 2017 we made contributions in the amount of 31 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 13 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including a onetime transition tax on certain current and accumulated earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in order to determine the amount of the transition tax we must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 earnings and profits ep of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings ep is similar to retained earnings of the subsidiary but requires other adjustments to conform to us tax rules we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a transition tax obligation of 157 million which we expect to elect to pay over eight years the current portion of 17 million is included in other current liabilities and the remainder is included within other liabilities on the balance sheet however we are awaiting further interpretative guidance continuing to assess available tax methods and elections and continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax liability 

in addition to the transition tax the tax act introduced a territorial tax system which will be effective beginning in 2018 as of the yearended december 30 2017 we have accumulated foreign earnings and profits of approximately 26 billion which are primarily in europe as our accumulated foreign earnings and profits continue to be indefinitely reinvested and the company is still finalizing its assessment of the territorial tax system and the tax act on its indefinite reinvestment assertion on a goforward basis it is impracticable for us to estimate a future tax cost for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws exchange rates circumstances existing when a repatriation sale or liquidation occurs and other factors 

management monitors the company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future 

 accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

derivatives and hedging targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  in august 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu intended to simplify hedge accounting by better aligning an entity’s financial reporting for hedging relationships with its risk management activities the asu also simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance the new guidance is effective on january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted for cash flow hedges existing at the adoption date the standard requires adoption on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption the amendments to presentation guidance and disclosure requirements are required to be adopted prospectively we will adopt the new asu in the first quarter of 2018 and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption 

improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost    in march 2017 the fasb issued an asu to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost the asu requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations if one is presented the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements interim or annual have not been issued or made available for issuance that is early adoption should be the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively on and after the effective date for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit in assets we will adopt the asu in the first quarter of 2018 if we had adopted the asu in the first quarter of 2017 on an as reported basis the impact to our corporate segment would have been an increase to cogs and sga of 325 million and 217 million respectively with an offsetting decrease to other income expense net oie of 542 million in the year ended december 30 2017 for the year ended december 31 2016 the impact to our corporate segment would have been a decrease to cogs and sga of 54 million and 26 million respectively with an offsetting increase to oie of 80 million adoption will have no impact on net 

income or cash flow the impact to the consolidated balance sheet at december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 would have been immaterial 

on a comparable basis the impact would have been an increase to cogs and sga of 169 million and 99 million respectively with an offsetting decrease to oie of 274 million in the year ended december 30 2017 on a comparable basis for the year ended december 31 2016 the impact would have been an increase to cogs and sga of 143 million and 82 million respectively with an offsetting decrease to oie of 225 million 

simplifying the test for goodwill impairment in january 2017 the fasb issued an asu to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the asu is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the amendments in this asu should be applied on a prospective basis we are currently assessing the impact and timing of adoption of this asu 

classification of certain cash receipts and payments   in august 2016 the fasb issued an asu to provide cash flow statement classification guidance for certain cash receipts and payments including a debt prepayment or extinguishment costs b contingent consideration payments made after a business combination c insurance settlement proceeds d distributions from equity method investees e beneficial interests in securitization transactions and f application of the predominance principle for cash receipts and payments with aspects of more than one class of cash flows the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period in which case adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively we will adopt the new asu in the first quarter of 2018 and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption 

leases   in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu which will require the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all leases with terms greater than 12 months the distinction between finance leases and operating leases will remain with similar classification criteria as current gaap to distinguish between capital and operating leases the principal difference from current guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current gaap the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we will adopt the new asu in the first quarter of 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this asu will have on our financial statements and disclosures please refer to note 7 for a summary of our undiscounted minimum rental commitments under operating leases as of december 30 2017 

recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities in january 2016 the fasb issued an asu which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance entities should apply the update by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 

revenue from contracts with customers   in may 2014 the fasb issued an asu which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers across all industries with final amendments issued in 2016 the core principle of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services to achieve that core principle an entity would be required to apply the following five steps 1 identify the contracts with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation the standard also calls for additional disclosures around the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers including significant judgments and changes in judgments when the asu was originally 

issued it was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption was not permitted on july 9 2015 the fasb decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year the updated standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early but not before the original effective date entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method recognizing the cumulative effect of the asu in retained earnings at the date of initial application we will adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective transition method which requires restating each prior reporting period presented the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements and is limited to timing and classification differences as well as disaggregated revenue disclosures 

future outlook 

we provide net sales guidance on a currencyneutral basis on this basis we expect net sales to be flat in 2018 the october acquisition of rxbar is expected to contribute 12 growth offset by a 1 decline related to the negative impact of our exit from direct store delivery dsd in us snacks including listprice adjustments and rationalization of stockkeeping units and a flat to 1 decrease for the remainder of our business 

from a profitability standpoint we expect currencyneutral adjusted operating profit to increase 46 during 2018 rxbar is expected to contribute 12 of this growth while the remaining growth is driven by remaining project k and zbb savings partially offset by an increase in brand building the resultant operating profit margin reaches our publicly stated marginexpansion target excluding the impact of pending accounting changes 

finally we expect currencyneutral adjusted eps to grow in the range of 9 to 11 in 2018 this growth incorporates an effective tax rate of 2021 56 lower than 2017 as a result of us tax reform the tax benefit is partially offset by the impact of deleveraging our capital structure and derisking pension plans by making additional contributions or adjusting target pension asset allocations plans to a more conservative investment mix which would be accompanied by a reduction in our expected return on assets assumption 

we expect that fullyear cash flow will be between 12 and 13 billion with year on year growth driven by higher net income sustained working capital improvement and the benefits of us tax reform our guidance includes remaining cash outlays related to project k and capital expenditures of approximately 500 million 

2018 nongaap financial measures 

starting in 2018 the company is modifying its presentation of nongaap measurements this modification aligns with how the company assesses its reporting segments which now includes the delivery of objectives for acquired businesses and presents performance in a way that is more simple and useful to investors using nomenclature that is used by peer companies nongaap financial measures used for 2018 guidance include organic net sales adjusted operating profit adjusted diluted eps and cash flow these nongaap financial measures are also evaluated for yearoveryear growth and on a currencyneutral basis to evaluate the underlying growth of the business and to exclude the effect of foreign currency we determine currencyneutral operating results by dividing or multiplying as appropriate the currentperiod local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prioryear period to determine what the current period us dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prioryear period these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 



pension plans commodities and certain foreign currency contracts we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability by providing these nongaap profitability measures management intends to provide investors with a meaningful consistent comparison of the companys profitability measures for the periods presented management uses these nongaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability such as project k zbb and revenue growth management to assess performance of newly acquired businesses as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments currencyneutral adjusted represents adjusted excluding foreign currency impact 

 

we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of marktomarket adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions interest rates return on assets and commodity prices or future decisions to be made by our management team and board of directors including decisions on future acquisitions or dispositions similarly because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifting country mix of our international earnings we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of foreign currency translation 

as a result these impacts are not included in the guidance provided therefore we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these nongaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company 

the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from nongaap guidance are shown below 



 2018 full year guidance for net sales operating profit and earnings per share are provided on a nongaap basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available 

 represents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items using weightedaverage statutory tax rates depending upon the applicable jurisdiction 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 14  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar russian ruble brazilian real and nigerian naira and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2017  was 22 billion representing a settlement obligation of 4 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2016  was 14 billion representing a settlement receivable of 16 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by 71 million at yearend 2017  and the settlement receivable at yearend 2016  would have become a settlement obligation of 46 million these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2017  and 2016  we entered into interest rate swaps and in some instances terminated interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar and euro notes refer to note 8  within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2017  was 23 billion representing a settlement obligation of 54 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2016  was 22 billion representing a settlement obligation of 64 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 27 million and 17 million at yearend 2017  and 2016 respectively 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2017  was 544 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 1 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2016  was 437 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 6 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by 41 million at yearend 2017  and the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 20 million at yearend 2016  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice 

sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of december 30 2017  and december 31 2016  we had posted collateral of 20 million and 41 million respectively in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2017  and december 31 2016  we posted 17 million and 7 million respectively in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

customers our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20 of consolidated net sales during 2016  comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 31 2016  approximately 12 of our consolidated receivables balance and 18 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2016  during 2016  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47 of us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global efficiency and effectiveness program project k 

in november 2013 the company announced a global efficiency and effectiveness program project k the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers 

business partners and other stakeholders in addition the project may not advance our business strategy as expected as a result we may not be able to implement project k as planned including the successful exit of our direct store delivery network and transitioning that business to a warehouse model events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of project k will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from the adoption of zerobased budgeting 

we adopted zerobased budgeting which presents significant organizational challenges as a result we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiative other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected in addition the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale 

any failure to implement our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management 

we are establishing a more formal revenue growth management discipline to help us realize price in a more effective way this approach addresses price strategy pricepack architecture promotion strategy mix management and trade strategies revenue growth management will involve changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers or consumers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits in addition the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiative these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers any failure to implement revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat potato flakes vegetable oils sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage 

exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans 

then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in some cases our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

the changing retail environment could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20 of consolidated net sales during 2016  comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 31 2016  approximately 12 of our consolidated receivables balance and 18 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2016  during 2016  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47 of us net sales there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to 

purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

additionally alternative retails channels such as internetbased retailers discount and dollar stores drug stores and club stores have become more prevalent if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels our business or financial results may be negatively impacted also if these alternative retail channels like internetbased retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences the products becoming unavailable to consumers or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products whether or not valid including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions including shifts in the geopolitical landscape tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes possible us tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the us such international earnings would be subject to us tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as product or raw material scarcity weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters fires or explosions terrorism political unrest health pandemics or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products 

the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal state and foreign laws or regulations we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing 

laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations changes in legal or regulatory requirements such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation further modifications to international trade policy including changes to or repeal of the north american free trade agreement could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve including as a result of related uncertainty and could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates for example the announcement of brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made for example at the end of 2016 we acquired ritmo investimentos controlling shareholder of parati sa afical ltda and padua ltda parati group the company will be integrating the parati group in 2017 and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from this acquisition will depend in part on the successful integration of this business our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting our rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful in addition if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the companys existing products the companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect 

our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business which subjects us to market and counterparty risk some of which is beyond our control 

in addition to cash we generate from our business our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason we may not be able to fund daily operations which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern in addition if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds which could have similar adverse consequences 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity   and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks as of december 31 2016  we had total debt of approximately 78 billion and total kellogg company equity of 19 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 



 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract recruit train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 31 2016  the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 75 billion of which 52 billion was goodwill and 23 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 151 billion and total kellogg company equity of 19 billion 

competition against retailer brands could negatively impact our business 

in nearly all of our product categories we face branded and pricebased competition our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer brands then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control including but not limited to network or hardware failures malicious or disruptive software unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors cyberattacks by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or socialactivist hacktivist organizations geopolitical events natural disasters failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and it or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer customer employee or company information if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology including such cyberattack privacy breaches data breaches or other incident involving one of the companys vendors that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business financial personal or stakeholder information the company may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm and may be exposed to legal liability which may adversely affect the companys results of operations andor financial condition in addition if the companys suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in the companys supply chain or reduced customer orders which would adversely affect the companys business operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our 

business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products in addition if in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly such finding could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 35 of our 2016  net sales 37 of 2015 and 39 of our 2014 net sales outside the united states we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 please refer to note 16 for more information regarding our operations in venezuela including the impact on our operations from currency restrictions and our decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations effective december 31 2016 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs 

or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2016 for example the continuing uncertainty arising from the brexit referendum in the united kingdom as well as ongoing terrorist activity may adversely impact global stock markets including the new york stock market on which our common shares are traded and general global economic conditions all of these factors are outside of our control but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets 

the results of the united kingdoms referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal the referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal 

the economic conditions and outlook in the united kingdom the european union and elsewhere could be further adversely affected by i the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit ii new or modified trading arrangements between the united kingdom and other countries iii the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or iv the risk that the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist any of these developments or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur could affect economic growth or business activity in the united kingdom or the european union and could result in the relocation of businesses cause business interruptions lead to economic recession or depression and impact the stability of the financial markets availability of credit currency exchange rates interest rates financial institutions and political financial and monetary systems any of these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and 

flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets adverse changes such as these could 

 

foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies in the event that such regulation is enacted we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

kellogg company and subsidiaries 

  

results of operations 

business overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

for more than 100 years consumers have counted on kellogg for greattasting highquality and nutritious foods kellogg is the world’s leading producer of cereal second largest producer of cookies and crackers and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods additional product offerings include toaster pastries cereal bars fruitflavored snacks and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 

segments and growth targets 

we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics products production processes types or classes of customers distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments we report results of operations in the following reportable segments us morning foods us snacks us specialty north america other europe latin america and asia pacific the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in note 18  within notes to consolidated financial statements 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longrange annual growth targets our targeted longrange annual growth is lowsingledigit 1 to 3 for currencyneutral comparable net sales midsingledigit 4 to 6 for currencyneutral comparable operating profit and highsingledigit 7 to 9 for currencyneutral comparable diluted net earnings per share eps 

operating margin expansion by 2018 

in 2016 we announced a plan to expand our currencyneutral comparable operating margin excluding venezuela by 350 basis points during 2016 through 2018 this is an increase and acceleration from our previous guidance which targeted a 1718 currencyneutral comparable operating margin excluding venezuela by 2020 

there are four elements to this accelerated margin expansion plan 

 

 

 

 

during this time period we will be working to stabilize net sales with an aim to returning to growth however the volume and price impact of exiting direct store delivery dsd the elasticity impact of certain pricing actions and the effect of portfolio optimization in conjunction with current industry dynamics lead us to forecast a decline in currencyneutral comparable net sales excluding venezuela by approximately 2 in 2017 nevertheless these marginexpansion actions are expected to drive accelerated growth in currencyneutral comparable operating profit and currency neutral comparable earnings per share excluding venezuela in 2017 and 2018 

in 2016 our advertising declined approximately 14 points as a percent to net sales on a currency neutral comparable basis excluding venezuela as a result of implementation of efficiency and effectiveness programs 

including zerobased budgeting the change in media landscape migrating investment to digital and shifting investment to food innovation and renovation as we continue to implement zerobased budgeting we may identify additional efficiency and effectiveness opportunities in advertising as we proceed through 2017 we may choose to reinvest these savings back into advertising or other areas such as food reformulation or capacity to drive revenue growth or to achieve our 2018 margin expansion target we remain committed to invest in our brands at an industryleading level to maintain the strength of our many recognizable brands in the marketplace 

guidance on operating profit margin expansion and net sales growth outlook is provided on a nongaap currencyneutral comparable basis excluding venezuela only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company please refer to the nongaap financial measures section for a further discussion of our use of nongaap measures including quantification of known expected adjustment items 

nongaap financial measures   

this filing includes nongaap financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of ongoing operations items excluded from our nongaap financial measures are discussed in the significant items impacting comparability section of this filing our management team consistently utilizes a combination of gaap and nongaap financial measures to evaluate business results to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business and for resource allocation decisions including incentive compensation as a result we believe the presentation of both gaap and nongaap financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends all historic nongaap financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

nongaap financial measures used include comparable net sales comparable gross margin comparable sga comparable operating profit comparable operating profit margin comparable effective tax rate comparable net income attributable to kellogg company comparable diluted eps and cash flow these nongaap financial measures are also evaluated for yearoveryear growth and on a currencyneutral basis to evaluate the underlying growth of the business and to exclude the effect of foreign currency we determine currencyneutral operating results by dividing or multiplying as appropriate the currentperiod local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prioryear period to determine what the current period us dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prioryear period these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 

 



periods presented management uses these nongaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability such as project k zbb and revenue growth management as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments currencyneutral comparable represents comparable excluding foreign currency impact 

 

 

these measures have not been calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures 

significant items impacting comparability

we have incurred integration costs related to the integration of the 2016 acquisition of parati group the 2015 acquisitions of bisco misr and mass foods the 2015 entry into a joint venture with tolaram africa and the 2012 acquisition of pringles integration completed in 2015 as we move these businesses into the kellogg business model we recorded pretax integration costs of 12 million 30 million and 43 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

marktomarket accounting for pension plans commodities and certain foreign currency contracts 

we recognize marktomarket adjustments for pension plans commodity contracts and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred actuarial gainslosses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gainslosses that are recognized in the quarter they occur we recorded total pretax marktomarket charges of 261 million 446 million and 784 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively within this total the pretax marktomarket charges for pension plans were 314 million 471 million and 744 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

other costs impacting comparability 

in 2016 we redeemed 475 million of our 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 in connection with the debt redemption we incurred 153 million of interest expense consisting primarily of a premium on the tender offer and also including accelerated losses on preissuance interest rate hedges acceleration of fees and debt discount on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer 

in 2015 a series of previously executed agreements between kelloggs and a third party variable interest entity vie were terminated resulting in our determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the vie accordingly we deconsolidated the financial statements of the vie as a result of the agreement terminations and related settlements we recognized a loss of 19 million in other income expense net 

  

in connection with the deconsolidation we derecognized all assets and liabilities of the vie including an allocation of a portion of goodwill from the us snacks operating segment resulting in a 67 million noncash gain which was recorded within operating profit 

during 2014 we incurred 6 million of costs related to the evaluation of potential acquisitions 

venezuela 

there was a material change in the business environment including a worsening of our access to key raw materials subject to restrictions and a related significant drop in production volume in the fourth quarter these supply chain disruptions along with other factors such as the worsening economic environment in venezuela and the limited access to dollars to import goods through the use of any of the available currency mechanisms have impaired our ability to effectively operate and fully control our venezuelan subsidiary 

as of december 31 2016 we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan subsidiary we recorded a 72 million pretax charge in other income expense net as we fully impaired the value of our cost method investment in venezuela the deconsolidation charge included the historical cumulative translation losses of approximately 63 million related to our venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity 

in 2015 we concluded that we were no longer able to obtain sufficient us dollars on a timely basis through the dipro exchange resulting in a decision to remeasure our venezuela subsidiarys financial statements using the dicom formerly simadi rate in connection with the change in rates we recorded pretax charges totaling 152 million including 112 million in the latin america operating segment and 40 million in the corporate operating segment of the total charges 100 million was recorded in cogs 3 million was recorded in sga and 49 million was recorded in other income expense net these charges consisted of 47 million related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivar at the simadi exchange rate recorded in other income expense net 56 million related to reducing inventory to the lower of cost or market recorded in cogs and 49 million related to the impairment of longlived assets in venezuela recorded primarily in cogs 

following the change to the dicom formerly simadi rate in 2015 certain nonmonetary assets related to our venezuelan subsidiary continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates as these assets were utilized by our venezuelan subsidiary during 2016 and 2015 they were recognized in the income statement at historical 

exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact we experienced an unfavorable pretax impact of approximately 11 million in 2016 and 17 million in 2015 related to the utilization of these remaining nonmonetary assets primarily impacting cogs 

shipping day differences 

our fiscal year normally ends on the saturday closest to december 31 and as a result a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year our 2014 fiscal year ended on january 3 2015 and included a 53rd week while quarters normally consist of 13week periods the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week for comparability the impact of the 53rd week is excluded from our comparable results the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 53rd week was 197 million for net sales 36 million for operating profit and 07 on a fullydiluted eps basis 

foreign currency translation and the impact of venezuela 

we evaluate the operating results of our business on a currencyneutral basis we determine currencyneutral operating results by dividing or multiplying as appropriate the currentperiod local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prioryear period to determine what the current period us dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prioryear period 

as a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our venezuela subsidiary from cencoex to the simadi exchange rate beginning mid2015 the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation as described above results in certain key performance metrics that are difficult to 

interpret when venezuela is included in the financial results to provide additional visibility to our business performance we have also included key performance metrics excluding our venezuela business we believe that the use of our standard currencyneutral methodology in combination with the additional visibility provided by excluding venezuela from our key performance metrics provides important information to more fully understand currencyneutral operating results

restructuring and cost reduction activities 

we view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

project k 

in february 2017 the company announced an expansion and an extension to its previouslyannounced global efficiency and effectiveness program “project k” to reflect additional and changed initiatives project k is expected to continue generating a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus 

for the business or utilized to achieve our 2018 margin expansion target the company expects that these savings may be used to improve operating margins or drive future growth in the business 

in addition to the original program’s focus on strengthening existing businesses in core markets increasing growth in developing and emerging markets and driving an increased level of valueadded innovation the extended program will also focus on implementing a more efficient gotomarket model for certain businesses and creating a more efficient organizational design in several markets since inception project k has provided significant benefits and is expected to continue to provide a number of benefits in the future including an optimized supply chain infrastructure the implementation of global business services a new global focus on categories increased agility from a more efficient organization design and improved effectiveness in gotomarket models 

we currently anticipate that project k will result in total pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented of 15 to 16 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments estimated to be approximately 11 billion cash expenditures of approximately 725 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2016 total cash expenditures as defined are expected to be approximately 300 million for 2017 and the balance thereafter total charges for project k in 2017 are expected to be approximately 400 to 450 million 

we now expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately 600 to 700 million in 2019 the savings will be realized primarily in selling general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from gotomarket business model changes the overall savings profile of the project has been updated to reflect our gotomarket initiatives that will impact both selling general and administrative expense and gross profit we have realized approximately 300 million of annual savings through the end of 2016 cost savings will continue to be utilized to increase margins and be strategically invested in areas such as instore execution sales capabilities including adding sales representatives reestablishing the kashi business unit and in the design and quality of our products we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

we funded much of the initial cash requirements for project k through our supplier financing initiative we are now able to fund much of the cash costs for the project through cash on hand as we have started to realize cash savings from the project 

we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis 

refer to note 5  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities 

other projects 

in 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zerobased budgeting zbb program in our north america business and during the first half of 2016 the program was expanded into our international businesses we expect cumulative savings from the zbb program to be approximately 450 to 500 million by the end of 2018 realized largely in selling general and administrative expense 

in support of the zbb initiative we incurred pretax charges of approximately 25 million and 12 million during 2016 and 2015 respectively we anticipate that zbb will result in total cumulative pretax charges up to approximately 50 million through 2017 which will consist primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original 

currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2016  includes a 153 million pretax charge to redeem 475 million of 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 the charge consisted primarily of a premium on the tender offer and also included accelerated losses on preissuance interest rate hedges acceleration of fees and debt discount on the redeemed debt and fees additionally increased weighting of fixed rate debt versus the prior year as well as higher average debt levels resulted in higher interest expense the increase in 2015  was driven by higher average levels of longterm debt and to higher interest rates partially resulting from lower levels of debt swapped to a variable rate interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 2016 5 2015 4 2014 8 we currently expect that our 2017  gross interest expense will be approximately 250 to 260 million 

  



income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2016  2015  and 2014  were 252 206 and 226 respectively comparable effective tax rates for 2016  2015  and 2014  were 247 256 and 282 respectively 

the 2016 effective income tax rate benefited from excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation totaling 36 million the 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates benefited from the marktomarket loss recorded for our pension plans refer to note 13  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables in addition we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments working capital is also impacted by the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock we had negative working capital of 15 billion and 25 billion as of december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  respectively 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  we had 240 million and 231 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 totaled 1628 million a decrease of 63 million as compared to 2015 the decrease from the prior year is due primarily to 97 million of aftertax cash costs related to the 475 million redemption of our 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 during the first quarter of 2016 in addition the incremental cash benefit of the supplier financing program was approximately 160 million lower in 2016 as the program moves towards maturity these yearoveryear decreases were partly mitigated by lower cash outflows for project k and taxes net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 amounted to 1691 million a decrease of 102 million compared with 2014 the decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the incremental cash flow benefit from the supplier financing initiative of approximately 210 million 

aftertax cash payments related to project k were 147 million in 2016 192 million in 2015 and 187 million in 2014 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 3 days and 15 days for 2016 and 2015 respectively core working capital in 2016 averaged 40 of net sales compared to 62 in 2015 and 76 in 2014 in 2016 both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative days of trade receivables and inventory on hand increased slightly from 2015 to 2016 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 33 million 33 million and 53 million in 2016  2015  and 2014 respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2021 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2017 of approximately 42 million actual 2017 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2016  amounted to 893 million a decrease of 234 million compared with 2015  in 2016 we acquired parati a manufacturer of biscuit powdered beverage and pasta brands in brazil for 381 million 

in 2015 we acquired for 445 million a 50 interest in multipro singapore pte ltd a leading distributor of a variety of food products in nigeria and ghana and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer in addition to our joint venture investment in 2015 we also acquired mass foods and a majority interest in bisco misr 

capital spending in 2016 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products including pringles in europe and the united states 

net cash used in investing activities of 1127 million in 2015 increased 554 million compared with 2014 due primarily to the 2015 acquisitions of bisco misr and mass foods described above 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39 in 2016 from 41 in 2015 and 40 in 2014 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 642 million 706 million and 1063 million for 2016  2015 and 2014 respectively 

total debt was 78 billion and 77 billion at yearend 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in november 2016 we issued 600 million of sevenyear 265 us dollar notes and repaid our 1875 500 million us dollar notes due 2016 at maturity 

in may 2016 we issued €600 million of eightyear 100 euro notes due 2024 and repaid our 445 fixed rate 750 million us dollar notes due 2016 at maturity 

in march 2016 we issued 750 million of tenyear 325 us dollar notes and 650 million of thirtyyear 450 us dollar notes also in march 2016 we redeemed 475 million of our 745 us dollar debentures due 2031 

in may 2015 we repaid our 350 million 1125 us dollar notes due 2015 at maturity 

in february 2015 we repaid our floatingrate 250 million us dollar notes due 2015 at maturity and in march 2015 we issued €600 million of tenyear 125 euro notes due 2025 

in march 2014 we redeemed 150 million of our 400 us dollar notes due 2020 342 million of our 3125 us dollar notes due 2022 and 189 million of our 275 us dollar notes due 2023 in connection with the debt redemption we incurred 1 million of interest expense offset by 8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and incurred 5 million expense recorded in other income expense net related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer 

in may 2014 we issued € 500 million of sevenyear 175 euro notes due 2021 using the proceeds for general corporate purposes which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings 

in may 2014 we issued cdn 300 million of threeyear 205 canadian dollar notes due 2017 using the proceeds together with cash on hand to repay our cdn 300 million 210 notes due may 2014 at maturity 

in april 2013 the board of directors approved a 1 billion share repurchase program expiring in april 2014 in february 2014 the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 15 billion in shares through december 2015 in december 2015 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 15 billion beginning in 2016 through december 2017 

during 2016 we purchased 6 million shares totaling 426 million during 2015 we purchased 11 million shares totaling 731 million during 2014 we purchased 11 million shares totaling 690 million 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 204 per share in 2016 198 per share in 2015 and 190 per share in 2014 total cash paid for dividends increased by 30 in both 2016 and 2015 on february 17 2017 the board of directors declared a dividend of 52 per common share payable on march 15 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 1 2017 

in february 2014 we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement to replace the existing unsecured fouryear credit agreement which would have expired in march 2015 the fiveyear credit agreement allows us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion and expires in 2019 

in january 2017 we entered into an unsecured 364day credit agreement to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 800 million at any time outstanding the new credit facility contains customary covenants and warranties including specified restrictions on indebtedness liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio if an event of default occurs then to the extent permitted the administrative agent may terminate the commitments under the 

credit facility accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreement and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders letter of credit exposure plus interest there are no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in february 2019 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2016  we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

during the first half of 2016 we executed a discrete customer program to extend customer payment terms in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms we entered into an agreement to sell on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the agreement provides for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 700 million but may be increased as additional financial institutions are added to the agreement during the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 15 billion of accounts receivable have been sold via this arrangement accounts receivable sold of 562 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 31 2016 

in addition to the discrete customer program above during 2016 we established an accounts receivable securitization program for certain customers which allows for extended customer payment terms in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms we entered into agreements with financial institutions to sell these receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently 600 million but may be increased as additional financial institutions are added to the agreement during the year ended december 31 2016 839 million of accounts receivable have been sold through this program as of december 31 2016 approximately 292 million of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program remained outstanding for which we received cash of approximately 255 million and a deferred purchase price asset of approximately 37 million

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 04 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 31 2016  we have property plant and equipment of 36 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 36 million of idle assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2016 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at december 31 2016  goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 75 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 23 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks the majority of these intangible assets are recorded in our us snacks reporting unit we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the us snacks reporting unit was approximately 41 and 43 in 2016 and 2015 respectively however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to 

use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 71 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2016 of 85 equates to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 29 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 31 2016  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately 54 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 201684 2015666 201441 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 461 our initial trend rate for 2017 of 475 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 31 2016  a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2017 benefits expense by approximately 7 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 111 million a one percent increase in 2017 health care claims cost over that projected from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 7 million and would increase 2017 expense by 02 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience loss arising from recognition of 2016 claims experience was approximately 5 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize at the end of 2014 we revised our mortality assumption after considering the society of actuaries soa updated mortality tables and improvement scale as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of december 31 2016 we considered the soas 2016 updated improvement scale the soas 2016 scale incorporates changes consistent with our view of future mortality improvements established in 2014 therefore we adopted the 2016 soa improvement scale this change to the mortality assumption decreased the yearend pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 39 million and 10 million respectively 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 31 2016  a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2017 benefits expense by approximately 3 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 230 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material actuarial losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions during 2016 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 307 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 418 million in 2015 of the total net loss recognized in 2016 approximately 393 million was related to assumption changes primarily unfavorable changes in the discount rate which were partially offset by the change in mortality assumptions the loss was offset by an 84 million gain from better than expected asset returns of the 418 million net loss recognized in 2015 approximately 245million was primarily related to favorable changes in the discount rate and other assumptions 666 million was related to asset returns less than expected and 3 million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs 

during 2016 we made contributions in the amount of 18 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 15 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

as of december 31 2016 substantially all foreign earnings were considered permanently invested accumulated foreign earnings of approximately 19 billion primarily in europe were considered indefinitely reinvested due to the varying tax laws around the world and fluctuation in foreign exchange rates it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on circumstances existing when a repatriation sale or liquidation occurs 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13  within notes to consolidated financial statements 

management monitors the company’s ability to utilize certain future tax deductions operating losses and tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration changes resulting from management’s assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

simplifying the test for goodwill impairment in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an asu to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the asu is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 the amendments in this asu should be applied on a prospective basis we are currently assessing the impact and timing of adoption of this asu 

intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory   in october 2016 the fasb as part of their simplification initiative issued an asu to improve the accounting for income tax consequences of intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory current generally accepted accounting principles gaap prohibit recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intraentity asset transfers until the asset has been sold to an outside party which is an 

exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in gaap the amendments in the asu eliminate the exception such that entities should recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance that is early adoption should be the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements the amendments in this asu should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the period of adoption we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of a 2017 transaction we anticipate a 38 million income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017 

classification of certain cash receipts and payments   in august 2016 the fasb issued an asu to provide cash flow statement classification guidance for certain cash receipts and payments including a debt prepayment or extinguishment costs b contingent consideration payments made after a business combination c insurance settlement proceeds d distributions from equity method investees e beneficial interests in securitization transactions and f application of the predominance principle for cash receipts and payments with aspects of more than one class of cash flows the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period in which case adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively we are currently assessing the impact and timing of adoption of the asu 

leases   in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu which will require the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all leases with terms greater than 12 months the distinction between finance leases and operating leases will remain with similar classification criteria as current gaap to distinguish between capital and operating leases the principal difference from current guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current gaap the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this asu will have on our financial statements and disclosures as well as timing of implementation 

recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities in january 2016 the fasb issued an asu which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance entities should apply the update by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

revenue from contracts with customers   in may 2014 the fasb issued an asu which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services to achieve that core principle an entity would be required to apply the following five steps 1 identify the contracts with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation when the asu was originally issued it was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption was not permitted on july 9 2015 the fasb decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year the updated standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early but not before the original effective date entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method recognizing the cumulative effect of the asu in retained earnings at the date of initial application an entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the asu as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change as well as reasons for significant changes we will adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using a modified retrospective transition method and the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our historical financial statements or future financial position or results of operations 

future outlook 

we provide guidance on a currencyneutral comparable basis on this basis we expect net sales to be down approximately 2 in 2017 slightly more than one point of this decline is associated with price reductions and an expected volume decline associated with our exit from direct store delivery dsd in us snacks this initiative could create an unusual degree of variability in our net sales in 2017 the remainder of the business is expected to be flat to down 1 we expect a slow start to the year as a result of lowerthananticipated consumption performance tradeinventory reductions challenges in our uk business and priceelasticity as we execute revenue growth management initiatives across our business 

from a profitability standpoint we expect currencyneutral comparable gross margin to increase as a result of price realization efforts and productivity initiatives though partially offset by the impact of the change in our us snacks gotomarket model finally we expect currencyneutral comparable operating profit growth in the range of 7 to 9 percent and currencyneutral comparable eps to increase in the range of 8 to 10 percent 

we expect that fullyear operating cash flow will be between 11 and 12 billion including roughly 300 million in expenditures related to project k as well as capital spending of 3 to 4 percent of net sales 

nongaap financial measures 

forwardlooking guidance for comparable net sales comparable operating profit comparable operating profit margin comparable net income attributable to kellogg comparable diluted eps and cash flow is included in this filing guidance for net sales and operating profit excludes the impact of marktomarket adjustments integration costs costs related to project k acquisitions dispositions foreigncurrency translation remeasurement of the venezuelan business and other items that could affect comparability guidance for earnings per share excludes the impact of marktomarket adjustments integration costs costs related to project k foreigncurrency translation remeasurement of the venezuelan business and other items that could affect comparability it includes the impact of acquisitions and dispositions we have provided these nongaap measures for future guidance for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical nongaap measures 

we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential fullyear financial impact of marktomarket adjustments venezuela remeasurement acquisitions or dispositions because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions interest rates return on assets and commodity prices or future decisions to be made by our management team and board of directors as a result these items are not included in the guidance provided therefore we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these nongaap measures used in our guidance without 

unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company 

see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded 

from nongaap guidance 



 2017 full year guidance for net sales operating profit and earnings per share are provided on a nongaap comparable and currencyneutral comparable basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available 

 represents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items using weightedaverage statutory tax rates depending upon the applicable jurisdiction 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 14  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar and russian ruble and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2016  was 14 billion representing a settlement receivable of 16 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2015  was 12 billion representing a settlement receivable of 13 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have become a settlement obligation of 46 million at yearend 2016  and the settlement receivable at yearend 2015  would have become a settlement obligation of 77 million these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year since that time the functional currency for our operations in venezuela has been the us dollar which in turn required bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities to be remeasured into us dollars using an exchange rate at which such balances could be settled as of the balance sheet date in addition revenues and expenses have been recorded in us dollars at an appropriate rate on the date of the transaction gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities were recorded in earnings 

  

as of december 31 2016  we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan subsidiary beginning in fiscal year 2017 we will no longer include the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary within our consolidated financial statements please refer to note 16  for more information regarding our operations in venezuela 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2016  and 2015  we entered into interest rate swaps and in some instances terminated interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar and euro notes refer to note 8  within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2016  was 22 billion representing a settlement obligation of 64 million there were no outstanding interest rate swaps as of yearend 2015  assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 17 million at yearend 2016  as there were no interest rate swaps or variable rate debt outstanding at yearend 2015  changes in interest rates would have no impact to annual interest expense 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2016  was 437 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 6 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2015  was 470 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 43 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement receivable would become a settlement obligation of approximately 20 million at yearend 2016  and the settlement obligation would increase approximately 27 million at yearend 2015  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of december 31 2016  we had posted collateral of 41 million in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of january 2 2016  we had no collateral posting requirements related to reciprocal collateralization agreements as of december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  we posted 7 million and 51 million respectively in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

we consider that taken as a whole the rights under our various patents which expire from time to time are a valuable asset but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a valuable asset but are not believed to be material 

seasonality demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and 

holidays we also custombake cookies for the girl scouts of the usa which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year 

working capital although terms vary around the world and by business types in the united states we generally have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2 10net 11 or 1 15net 16 receipts from goods sold supplemented as required by borrowings provide for our payment of dividends repurchases of our common stock capital expansion and for other operating expenses and working capital needs we anticipate establishing a discrete customer program which would allow for extended customer payment terms in connection with this program we may enter into an agreement with one or more financial institutions to monetize these receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet we currently estimate that the amount of these receivables held at any time by the financial institutions will be approximately 500 to 600 million 

customers our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2015  comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 2 2016  approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 27 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2015  during 2015  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47 of us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments 

backlog for the most part orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders at january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  was not material to us 

competition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories both domestically and internationally our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products which are typically distributed at lower prices and generally with other food products principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions product quality taste convenience nutritional value price advertising and promotion 

research and development research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research in battle creek michigan and at other locations around the world our expenditures for research and development were approximately in millions 2015 193 2014 199 2013 199 

regulation our activities in the united states are subject to regulation by various government agencies including the food and drug administration federal trade commission and the departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies various state and local agencies also regulate our activities other agencies and bodies outside of the united states including those of the european union and various countries states and municipalities also regulate our activities 

environmental matters our facilities are subject to various us and foreign federal state and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways we are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations we believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program project k 

in november 2013 the company announced a global fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program project k the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the project may not advance our business strategy as expected as a result we may not be able to implement project k as planned including realizing in full or in part the anticipated benefits from our program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of project k will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from the adoption of zerobased budgeting 

we recently adopted zerobased budgeting which presents significant organizational challenges as a result we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiative other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected in addition the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational 

changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale 

any failure to implement our cost reduction organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation drought and other weather conditions including the potential effects of climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans 

then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a 

withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products or in effectively assessing changing and setting proper pricing 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2015  comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 2 2016  approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 27 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2015  during 2015  our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes possible us tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the us such international earnings would be subject to us tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations contract manufacturer locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently our ability to make move and sell products globally is critical to our success factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters fires or explosions terrorism political unrest health pandemics or strikes could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or contract manufacturers operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products we are also 

regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to among other things increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes government price control repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act 

with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes trends within the food industry change 

often and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to among other things reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect 

our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity   and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future or enter into offbalance sheet financing which would increase our leverage risks as of january 2 2016  we had total debt of approximately 78 billion and total kellogg company equity of 21 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of january 2 2016  the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 72 billion of which 50 billion was goodwill and 22 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 153 billion and total kellogg company equity of 21 billion 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands 

in nearly all of our product categories we face branded and pricebased competition our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer brands then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks these events could compromise our confidential 

information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 37 of our 2015  net sales and 39 of our 2014 and 2013 net sales outside the united states we manufacture our products in 20 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 the future results of our venezuelan operations may be adversely affected by many factors including our ability to take action to mitigate the effect of a further devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar the foreign currency exchange rate and exchange controls other actions of the venezuelan government and the general economic conditions in 

the country resulting from continued hyperinflation continued or increased labor unrest and the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in particular any additional government actions such as imposition of price restrictions that prohibit the company from pricing its products at acceptable levels could have a further adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition that could become material in the future additionally consumer demand for the company’s products in venezuela may decline as a result continued inflationary price increases these and other factors could negatively impact the companys ability to manage our venezuelan operations and could result in the deconsolidation of our venezuelan business see note 15 for more information regarding venezuela 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations 

climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the longterm health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report there is continuing scientific evidence as well as concern from members of the general public that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events wildfires and flooding as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks leading to increased prices and volatility especially in the energy and commodity markets adverse changes such as these could 

 

foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies in the event that such regulation is enacted we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products lastly consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing 

products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

significant items impacting comparability   

project k and cost reduction activities   

during 2013 we announced project k a fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program the program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business we expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues gross margin operating profit and cash flow we recorded pretax charges related primarily to project k of 311 million in 2015 298 million in 2014 and 250 million in 2013 

in 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zerobased budgeting zbb program in our north america business in support of the zbb initiative we incurred pretax charges of approximately 12 million in 2015 

see the restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information 

acquisitions and dispositions 

in september 2015 we completed the acquisition of mass foods egypts leading cereal company for 46 million or 44 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired the acquisition added 4 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the european reportable segment for 2015 the acquisition added less than 1 million of incremental operating profit before transaction and integration costs to our reported results for 2015 

in january 2015 we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in bisco misr the number one packaged biscuits company in egypt for 125 million or 117 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired the acquisition added 54 million in incremental net sales to our reported results in the european reportable segment for 2015 the acquisition added 4 million of incremental operating profit before transaction and integration costs to our reported results for 2015 

during the quarter ended september 27 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell our vegan and vegetarian cannedmeat substitute business unit under the loma linda brand to atlantic natural foods anf llc of nashville nc the disposition negatively impacted reported net sales in the us specialty reportable segment by approximately 9 million in 2015 

integration and transaction costs 

we have incurred integration and transaction costs related to the 2015 acquisitions of bisco misr and mass foods the 2015 entry into a joint venture with tolaram africa and the 2012 acquisition of pringles as we move these businesses into the kellogg business model we recorded pretax integration and transaction costs of 30 million in 2015 we also recorded pretax integration costs of 43 million and 65 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

marktomarket accounting for pension plans commodities and certain foreign currency contracts 

we recognize marktomarket adjustments for pension plans commodity contracts and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred actuarial gainslosses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gainslosses that are recognized in the quarter they occur we recorded pretax marktomarket charges of 446 million 784 million and a benefit of 947 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

other costs impacting comparability 

in 2015 a series of previously executed agreements between kelloggs and a third party variable interest entity vie were terminated resulting in our determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the vie accordingly we deconsolidated the financial statements of the vie as a result of the agreement terminations and related settlements we recognized a loss of 19 million in other income expense net 

  

in connection with the deconsolidation we derecognized all assets and liabilities of the vie including an allocation of a portion of goodwill from the us snacks operating segment resulting in a 67 million noncash gain which was recorded within operating profit 

during 2014 we incurred 6 million of costs related to the evaluation of potential acquisitions 

venezuela remeasurement and longlived asset impairment 

while we continue to qualify for participation in cencoex at the official rate there has been a continued reduction in the level of us dollars available to exchange in part due to recent declines in the price of oil and the overall decline of the macroeconomic environment within the country we have experienced an increase in the amount of time it takes to exchange bolivars for us dollars through the cencoex exchange during the year given this economic backdrop and upon review of us dollar cash needs in our venezuela operations as of the quarter ended july 4 2015 we concluded that we were no longer able to obtain sufficient us dollars on a timely basis through the cencoex exchange to support our venezuela operations resulting in a decision to remeasure our venezuela subsidiarys financial statements using the simadi rate we have evaluated all of the facts and circumstances surrounding our venezuelan business and determined that as of january 2 2016 the simadi rate continues to be the appropriate rate to use for remeasuring our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements 

  

in connection with the change from the cencoex rate to the simadi rate that occurred in the quarter ended july 4 2015 we evaluated the carrying value of our nonmonetary assets for impairment and lower of cost or market adjustments as a result of moving from the cencoex official rate to the simadi rate we recorded pretax charges totaling 152 million including 112 million in the latin america operating segment and 40 million in the corporate operating segment of the total charges 100 million was recorded in cogs 3 million was recorded in sga and 49 million was recorded in other income expense net these charges consist of 47 million related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivar at the simadi exchange rate recorded in other income expense net 56 million related to reducing inventory to the lower of cost or market recorded in cogs and 49 million related to the impairment of longlived assets in venezuela recorded primarily in cogs 

as expected after moving to the simadi rate our venezuelan subsidiary utilized assets that continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates this resulted in an additional unfavorable impact of 17 million in the latin america operating segment including an impact to cogs of 12 million and sga of 5 million the total 2015 impact of moving from the cencoex official rate to the simadi rate was 169 million on a pretax basis or approximately 42 on a fullydiluted eps basis 

as of january 2 2016 certain nonmonetary assets related to our venezuelan subsidiary continue to be remeasured at historical exchange rates as these assets are utilized by our venezuelan subsidiary during the first half of 2016 they will be recognized in the income statement at historical exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately 4 million 

shipping day differences 

the companys fiscal year normally ends on the saturday closest to december 31 and as a result a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year the companys 2014 fiscal year ended on january 3 2015 and included a 53rd week while quarters normally consist of 13week periods the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week for comparability the impact of the 53rd week is excluded from our comparable results the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 53rd week was 197 million for net sales 36 million for operating profit and 07 on a fullydiluted eps basis 

foreign currency translation and the impact of venezuela 

we evaluate the operating results of our business on a currencyneutral basis we determine currencyneutral operating results by dividing or multiplying as appropriate the currentperiod local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prioryear period to determine what the current period us dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prioryear period 

as a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our venezuela subsidiary from cencoex to the simadi exchange rate beginning mid2015 the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation as described above results in certain yearoveryear growth rates that require additional commentary we believe that the use of our standard currencyneutral methodology in combination with the additional commentary provides important information to more fully understand our currencyneutral operating results 

our 2015 guidance that was maintained consistently throughout the year reflected an expectation of being approximately flat for currencyneutral comparable net sales and a decline of 2 to 4 for currencyneutral comparable operating profit within this guidance venezuela was expected to contribute approximately 1 of growth for both currencyneutral comparable net sales and currencyneutral comparable operating profit in the second half of 2015 the venezuela business experienced significant unplanned inflation that impacted both currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit that was much larger than anticipated in the guidance to provide increased visibility into how we have delivered against our 2015 guidance the commentary below provides both currencyneutral comparable results which include the entire impact of venezuela as well as an adjusted measure that excludes the impact of venezuela 

for the quarter ended january 2 2016 latin america currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 453 and 462 respectively excluding venezuela latin america currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 14 and 20 respectively 

for the yeartodate period ended january 2 2016 latin america currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth were 246 and 154 respectively excluding venezuela latin america currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 13 and a decline of 34 respectively 

for the quarter ended january 2 2016 kellogg consolidated currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 42 and 28 respectively excluding venezuela kellogg consolidated currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth would have been approximately 04 and 03 respectively 

for the yeartodate period ended january 2 2016 kellogg consolidated currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth was 12 and a decline of 23 respectively excluding venezuela kellogg consolidated currencyneutral comparable net sales and operating profit would have declined by 08 and 36 respectively 

nongaap measures 

comparability of certain financial measures is affected significantly by several types of financial impacts such as foreign currency translation integration and transaction costs marktomarket adjustments for pension plans 

commodities and certain foreign currency contracts project k costs costs associated with the venezuela remeasurement and longlived asset impairment costs associated with the vie deconsolidation differences in shipping days acquisitions dispositions and other costs impacting comparability to provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance we use nongaap financial measures within mda that exclude these financial impacts 

nongaap financial measures used include comparable net sales currencyneutral comparable net sales comparable net sales growth currencyneutral comparable net sales growth comparable gross margin currencyneutral comparable gross margin comparable gross profit currencyneutral comparable gross profit comparable sga currencyneutral comparable sga comparable operating margin currencyneutral comparable operating margin comparable operating profit currencyneutral comparable operating profit comparable operating profit growth currencyneutral comparable operating profit growth comparable income taxes currencyneutral comparable income taxes comparable effective tax rate currencyneutral comparable effective tax rate comparable net income attributable to kellogg company currencyneutral comparable net income attributable to kellogg company comparable diluted eps currencyneutral comparable diluted eps comparable diluted eps growth and currencyneutral comparable diluted eps growth 

financial results 

for the full year 2015 our reported net sales decreased by 72 due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and shipping day differences from the 53rd week that was recognized in the prior year currencyneutral comparable net sales increased by 12 which was better than our expectations and includes the benefit of pricing taken in venezuela to offset cost inflation we experienced currencyneutral comparable net sales growth in latin america which was driven primarily by pricing taken in venezuela we also experienced currencyneutral comparable net sales growth in asiapacific u s specialty and the canadian business which is included in the north america other reportable segment 

reported operating profit increased by 66 primarily due to the favorable yearoveryear change in the pension marktomarket which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation the impact of remeasuring our venezuela business using the simadi rate in the second quarter of 2015 and the impact of resetting incentive compensation levels currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined by 23 at the high end of our expectations due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which impacted results by approximately 3 the 1 growth excluding the effect of resetting incentive compensation levels was the result of sales growth and a 50 basis point reduction in brandbuilding investment as a percentage of net sales our brand building is down including shifts of investment into other areas such as food the evolving shift in media investment from tv to digital and efficiency and effectiveness benefits our zerobased budgeting initiative may identify additional efficiency and effectiveness opportunities in brand building as we proceed through 2016 we may choose to reinvest these savings back into brand building or other areas such as food reformulation or capacity to drive revenue growth we remain committed to invest in our brands at an industryleading level to maintain the strength of our many recognizable brands in the marketplace 

reported diluted eps of 172 was down 17 compared to the prior year of 175 reported diluted eps was impacted negatively by project k costs 64 marktomarket accounting 84 the remeasurement of the venezuelan business using the simadi rate 42 foreign currency translation 28 and integration costs 06 and was impacted positively by a vie deconsolidation 14 and acquisitions 01 currencyneutral comparable diluted eps of 381 was flat compared to prior year of 381 in line with our expectations

us morning foods 

currencyneutral comparable net sales declined 16 as a result of unfavorable volume and pricingmix this segment consists of cereal toaster pastries health and wellness bars and beverages

to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals by improving our brand building and the new products we 

launched we also invested in our foods and put fun back in the box with avengers ®   and disney frozen ® themed cereals 

our cereal business reported a decline for the full year although we continued to reflect improving trends throughout the year and we reported consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as our business continues to improve ahead of category trends our six core cereals in combination  special k ®  raisin bran ®  frosted flakes ®  miniwheats ®  froot loops ®  and  rice krispies ®  gained share and increased consumption for the year with even stronger growth in both share and consumption in the fourth quarter special k ®   posted consumption growth and share gains for the year and even stronger results for the fourth quarter driven primarily by the renovation work we completed on special k ® red berries the good growth we saw all year on raisin bran ®   was the result of great advertising and the introduction of raisin bran ®   with cranberries 

we expect to continue driving sales in 2016 with the introduction of new products like special k ®   nourish a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see and the food includes fruits nuts and ontrend grains like quinoa initial response on this innovation has been encouraging in addition we’re launching miniwheats ® harvest delights smorz ®  and disney dory ® themed cereal 

toaster pastries reported a slight sales decline for the year health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline 

currencyneutral comparable operating profit increased 21 due to improved gross margins resulting from lower input costs and project k savings as well as lower brandbuilding investment this was partially offset by the sales performance increased distribution costs and resetting of incentive compensation levels 

us snacks 

currencyneutral comparable net sales declined 16 as a result of decreased volume which was partially offset by favorable pricingmix this segment consists of crackers cereal bars cookies savory snacks and fruitflavored snacks 

crackers posted a sales decline as consumption declined across several of our products while consumption increased for our big 3 brands in combination  cheezit ®  town house ®  and club ®  the consumption decline was due primarily to weakness in special k ®  cracker chips during the first half of the year and fullyear weakness in special k ®  popcorn chips the special k ®  cracker chips products we restaged earlier this year posted consumption growth for the past two quarters as a result of improvements in packaging and food we expect the impact of the remaining skus to lessen as we progress through 2016 the consumption increase for our big 3 brands was primarily the result of strong consumption and share gains in cheezit ®  due to the cheezit ®  grooves and cheezit ®  extra toasty innovations 

the bars business declined due to weakness in the special k ®  and fiber plus ®  brands the performance of our special k bars has improved in the second half of the year as a result of new products and renovation that occurred early in the year and good results from special k ®   chewy nut bars that were launched in mid2015 rice krispies treats ®  reported doubledigit consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation 

the cookies business consumption declined for the year resulting in lost share although we have seen improving trends over the second half of 2015 as a result of good performance in chips deluxe ®  fudge shoppe ®  and  famous amos ®  due to expanded distribution new products and increased instore activity we have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016 we are also going to give the brands new support in 2016 including the relaunch of advertising featuring the keebler ®  elves

currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined by 08 due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels which more than offset the favorable sales performance 

north america other 

currencyneutral comparable net sales declined 32 due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricingmix 

the us frozen business reported a net sales decline due to the impact from egg prices network improvements and a decision to draw down inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags for our veggie foods business the packaging conversion is going well but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year the eggo ®  handheld sandwiches posted doubledigit consumption growth and share gains for the year 

the canada business reported a broadbased net sales increase across several categories for the year for 2016 the canadian team is planning introductions of new products and improved support much like the rest of the north american region 

kashi reported a doubledigit net sales decline although the business continues to experience stabilized distribution and sequential improvement across the last two quarters in part due to the impact of the introduction of new products in the second half of 2015 bear naked ®  granola posted doubledigit consumption growth for the year we expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a focus on new products high in protein from plants 

currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined 161 primarily due to unfavorable sales performance in the us frozen and kashi businesses net cost inflation including transactional currency expense in the canadian business and increased material costs in the us frozen business and the resetting of incentive compensation levels

the pringles ®  business posted strong doubledigit net sales growth as a result of good promotions innovations and distribution gains throughout the year both the base business and the launch of pringles ®  tortilla in the uk and germany contributed we have some exciting activity planned for pringles ®  in 2016 as well including soccerthemed activity planned to coincide with the euros soccer tournament in the summer and the continued rollout of pringles ® tortilla in the region 

the wholesome snacks business posted growth in the second half of the year this was due to better results in the uk driven in part by disney ® branded snacks mini biscuits crunchy nut ®  and rice krispies squares ®  in addition the russian business did well we also have new foods coming across the region in 2016 

the cereal business in europe declined due to challenges in the category in many of the countries however we improved our plans for special k ®   and crunchy nut ®   in the uk saw good performance from extra ®   in italy and 

invested behind kellogg’s ® branded granola in germany also we recently launched the ancient legends ®   brands in the region these are great products which include ontrend ingredients like spelt apples sultanas and chia seeds we are also applying learnings from our us cereal business including the renovation of special k ®   red berries the launch of special k ®   nourish and we’re also adding more fun in the box 

currencyneutral comparable operating profit improved 43 due to net cost deflation and strong savings including savings from project k 

latin america 

currencyneutral comparable net sales improved 246 due to favorable volume and pricingmix including the impact of pricing actions in venezuela excluding venezuela currencyneutral comparable net sales would have grown 13 

we experienced volume growth in several of our markets including mexico we also realized strong price realization in venezuela as a result of pricing actions taken to offset cost inflation cereal sales in the region increased and we have held or gained share in most of the region these share gains have been driven by childrens and family brands and the introduction of kelloggbranded granolas and muesli products 

sales in the snacks business also increased driven by innovation and gotomarket activity the pringles ®  business continued to perform well and we have launched pringles ®  tortilla in the region

asia pacific 

currencyneutral comparable net sales increased 40 as a result of increased volume which was partially offset by unfavorable pricingmix unfavorable pricingmix was primarily the result of country mix 

the sales increase was the result of doubledigit growth in the asian markets doubledigit growth in subsaharan africa and midsingledigit growth in the savory snacks business across the region the growth in asia included doubledigit sales growth in japan driven by the continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging as well as doubledigit growth in korea and southeast asia the savory snacks business reported broadbased sales growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution 

this sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the australian cereal category however the granola and müesli segments are growing well and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall australian business in 2016 we are also applying lessons learned in our us business to our australia business 

currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined 37 as our investment of project k savings into emerging markets in the region behind brand investments and capabilities more than offset the favorable sales performance

us morning foods 

currencyneutral comparable net sales declined 48 as a result of unfavorable volume and pricingmix this segment consists of cereal toaster pastries health and wellness bars and beverages 

the cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind categorybuilding programs that started early in the year much of our decline in the cereal category has come from special k ®  we experienced weakness in special k ®  as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer trends regarding weight management as a result we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness this focus will stress the role that special k ®  plays in a healthy lifestyle we have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the following initiatives 

 

we expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the special k ®  and on the cereal business as a whole our plan for investment is longterm and the levels content and effectiveness of the support will evolve and increase over time 

toaster pastries reported a sales decline for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013 however we did gain share for the year and introduced a new pbj innovation in november and we expect this to improve sales results health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year 

currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined 100 due to the unfavorable sales performance and a midsingledigit increase in cereal brandbuilding investment this was partially offset by a decrease in brandbuilding investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages and continued cost discipline

currencyneutral comparable net sales declined 28 as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricingmix this segment consists of crackers cereal bars cookies savory snacks and fruitflavored snacks

the bars business declined due to weakness in the special k ®  and fiber plus ®  brands the issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category to address these issues we launched new products and activities in the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new greattasting special k ®  snack bars with new packaging and new positioning this activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world this new product started to arrive in stores in late december rice krispies treats ®  and nutrigrain ®  both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation 

the cookies business declined resulting in lost share however we saw share gains from chips deluxe ®  as a result of new cobranded products we experienced soft performance in our 100calorie packs business throughout the year we are migrating consumers to an expanded line of singleserve products which should help to reduce the impact of the decline we also experienced the negative impact of a sku rationalization initiative 

savory snacks reported midsingledigit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business grab ‘n go and the new pringles ®  tortilla product 

currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined by 109 due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation this was partially offset by continued cost discipline

kashi reported a decline in sales as we continued to experience softness in the cereal category we have identified areas of focus for kashi ®  which is a great brand in a category that is on trend we have begun the execution of this new positioning through the following initiatives 

 

we expect that these initiatives will have a positive impact on the performance of kashi ®  

currencyneutral comparable operating profit declined 38 primarily due to unfavorable sales performance this was partially offset by continued cost discipline

restructuring and cost reduction activities 

we view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

project k 

project k a fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program was announced in november 2013 and is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business we expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues gross margin operating profit and cash flow 

the focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets increase growth in developing and emerging markets and drive an increased level of valueadded innovation the program is expected to provide a number of benefits including an optimized supply chain infrastructure the implementation of global business services and a new global focus on categories 

we currently anticipate that project k will result in total pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented of 12 to 14 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments estimated to be 900 million to 11 billion cash expenditures of approximately 625 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2015 total cash expenditures as defined are expected to be approximately 150 million for 2016 and the balance of 125 to 325 million thereafter total charges for project k in 2016 are expected to be approximately 175 to 200 million 

we expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately 425 to 475 million by 2018 with approximately twothirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold we have realized approximately 180 million of annual savings through the end of 2015 we expect approximately 100 million of incremental savings in 2016 approximately 75 to 80 percent of which will come from cost of goods sold cost savings will be utilized to increase margins and drive sales growth through additional investments in advertising instore execution sales capabilities including adding sales representatives reestablishing the kashi business unit and in the design and quality of our products we will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

as a result of project k capital spending levels were increased to 4 of net sales during both 2014 and 2015 our ongoing business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 34 of net sales annually 

thus far we have funded much of the cash requirements for project k through our supplier financing initiative due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and shortterm debt 

we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis 

refer to note 4  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities 

other projects 

in 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zerobased budgeting zbb program in our north america business this zbb program is expected to deliver visibility to 100 million in annual savings in north america during 2016 we will begin to expand zbb into our international businesses during 2016 with modest savings expected in certain locations in 2016 we expect increased savings to be realized in our international businesses in 2017 and beyond 

in support of the zbb initiative we incurred pretax charges of approximately 12 million in 2015 we anticipate that zbb will result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately 25 to 50 million through 2016 which will consist primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table the increase in 2015 was primarily due to a higher average level of longterm debt and to higher interest rates partially resulting from lower levels of debt swapped to a variable rate the decline in 2014 was primarily due to refinancing of maturing longterm debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on longterm debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 2015 4 2014 8 2013 7 we currently expect that our 2016  gross interest expense will be approximately 235 to 245 million 

  



income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 206 226 and 304 respectively comparable effective tax rates for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 256 282 and 284 respectively 

the 2015  and 2014 effective income tax rates benefited from the marktomarket loss recorded for our pension plans refer to note 12  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables in addition we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of longterm debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments these factors coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations pay dividends fund acquisition opportunities and repurchase our common stock reduce our working capital amounts we had negative working capital of 25 billion and 10 billion as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectively 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  we had 231 million and 257 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations these amounts include 2 million and 68 million at january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  respectively subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 



operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2015  amounted to 1691 million a decrease of 102 million compared with 2014  the decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the incremental cash flow benefit from the supplier financing initiative of approximately 210 million our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to 1793 million a decrease of 14 million compared with 2013 due primarily to the negative incremental impact of project k cash requirements mitigated somewhat by the positive impact from the supplier financing initiative of approximately 210 million 

aftertax cash payments related to project k were 192 million in 2015 187 million in 2014 and 18 million in 2013 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory excluding inventoriable marktomarket pension costs and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 14 days and 27 days for 2015 and 2014 respectively core working capital in 2015 averaged 62 of net sales compared to 76 in 2014 and 78 in 2013 in 2015 both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative days of trade receivables and inventory on hand increased slightly from 2014 to 2015 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 33 million 53 million and 48 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2021 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2016 of approximately 43 million actual 2016 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 



the decrease in cash flow as defined in 2015  compared to 2014  was due primarily to the unfavorable year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the favorable year over year impact of trade payables as a result of the supplier financing initiative the increase in cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core working capital partially offset by the negative impact of project k cash requirements 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2015  amounted to 1127 million an increase of 554 million compared with 2014  in 2015 we acquired for 445 million a 50 interest in multipro singapore pte ltd a leading distributor of a variety of food products in nigeria and ghana and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer in addition to our joint venture investment in 2015 we also acquired mass foods and a majority interest in bisco misr 

capital spending in 2015  included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products including pringles in asiapacific 

net cash used in investing activities of 573 million in 2014  decreased 68 million compared with 2013 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales increased to 41 in 2015 from 40 in 2014 which was a decrease from 43 in 2013 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 706 million 1063 million and 1141 million for 2015  2014 and 2013 respectively the use of cash in financing activities compared to the prior year declined due primarily to net proceeds from notes payable of 374 million in 2015 versus 89 million in 2014 

total debt was 78 billion and 74 billion at yearend 2015 and 2014 respectively 

in may 2015 we repaid our 350 million 1125 us dollar notes due 2015 at maturity 

in february 2015 we repaid our floatingrate 250 million us dollar notes due 2015 at maturity and in march 2015 we issued €600 million of tenyear 125 euro notes due 2025 

in march 2014 we redeemed 150 million of our 400 us dollar notes due 2020 342 million of our 3125 us dollar notes due 2022 and 189 million of our 275 us dollar notes due 2023 in connection with the debt redemption we incurred 1 million of interest expense offset by 8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and incurred 5 million expense recorded in other income expense net related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer 

in may 2014 we issued € 500 million of sevenyear 175 euro notes due 2021 using the proceeds for general corporate purposes which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings 

in may 2014 we issued cdn 300 million of threeyear 205 canadian dollar notes due 2017 using the proceeds together with cash on hand to repay our cdn 300 million 210 notes due may 2014 at maturity 

in february 2013 we issued 250 million of twoyear floatingrate us dollar notes and 400 million of tenyear 275 us dollar notes resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 645 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including together with cash on hand repayment of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 425 us dollar notes due march 2013 

in april 2013 the board of directors approved a 1 billion share repurchase program expiring in april 2014 in february 2014 the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 15 billion in shares through december 2015 in december 2015 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 15 billion beginning in 2016 through december 2017 

during 2015 we purchased 11 million shares totaling 731 million during 2014 we purchased 11 million shares totaling 690 million in may 2013 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid 355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through august 2013 the total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the asr was based upon the volume weighted average price of the company’s stock over the term of the agreement total shares 

purchased in 2013 including shares delivered under the asr amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling 544 million 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 198 per share in 2015 190 per share in 2014 and 180 per share in 2013 total cash paid for dividends increased by 30 in 2015 and 40 in 2014 in february 2016 the board of directors declared a dividend of 50 per common share payable on march 15 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 1 2016 

in february 2014 we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement to replace the existing unsecured fouryear credit agreement which would have expired in march 2015 the fiveyear credit agreement allows us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in february 2019 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of january 2 2016  we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis we anticipate establishing a discrete customer program which would allow for extended customer payment terms in connection with this program we may enter into an agreement with one or more financial institutions to monetize these receivables resulting in the receivables being derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet we currently estimate that the amount of these receivables held at any time by the financial institutions will be approximately 500 to 600 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations

as of january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 04 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at january 2 2016  we have property plant and equipment of 36 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 51 million of idle assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2015 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at january 2 2016  goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 72 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 22 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the us snacks reporting unit was approximately 43 and 59 in 2015 and 2014 respectively however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses additionally we have 25 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia fair value of the intangibles for this business exceeded carrying value in 2015 if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation this could have resulted in an impairment loss management will continue to monitor the situation closely 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to 

use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 68 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2016 of 85 equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 32 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 2 2016  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately 

55 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2015666 201441 2013–545 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 495 our initial trend rate for 2016 of 500 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at january 2 2016  a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2016 benefits expense by approximately 4 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 89 million a 100 basis point excess of 2016 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 4 million and would increase 2016 expense by 02 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience loss arising from recognition of 2015 claims experience was approximately 3 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize at the end of 2014 we revised our mortality assumption after considering the society of actuaries soa updated mortality tables and improvement scale as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of january 2 2016 we considered the soas 2015 updated improvement scale and believe our assumption remains appropriate 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using willis towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at january 2 2016  a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately 2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 222 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience during 2015 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 418 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 918 million in 2014 of the total net loss recognized in 2015 approximately 245 million was related primarily to favorable changes in the discount rate and other assumptions and 666 million was related to asset losses and 3 million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs of the 918 million net loss recognized in 2014 approximately 911 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions and 41 million was related to asset losses and 34 million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs 

during 2015 we made contributions in the amount of 19 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 14 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 12  within notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities in january 2016 the fasb issued an asu which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance entities should apply the update by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

balance sheet classification of deferred taxes    in november 2015 the fasb issued an asu to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the asu requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 entities should apply the new guidance either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating when we will adopt the updated standard and whether to use the prospective or retrospective method our yearend 2015 balance for current deferred tax assets and liabilities was 227 and 9 million respectively please see note 12  for more information on our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments   in september 2015 the fasb issued an asu to simplify the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments for items in a business combination the asu requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 entities should apply the new guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the asu with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs in april 2015 the fasb issued an asu to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs the asu requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this asu the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2016 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement in april 2015 the fasb issued an asu to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted entities should apply the new guidance either 1 prospectively to all arrangements entered into or 

materially modified after the effective date or 2 retrospectively we will adopt the updated standard prospectively in the first quarter of 2016 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

revenue from contracts with customers   in may 2014 the fasb issued an asu which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services to achieve that core principle an entity would be required to apply the following five steps 1 identify the contracts with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation when the asu was originally issued it was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption was not permitted on july 9 2015 the fasb decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year the updated standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early but not before the original effective date entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method recognizing the cumulative effect of the asu in retained earnings at the date of initial application an entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the asu as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change as well as reasons for significant changes we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this asu will have on our financial statements and disclosures as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption 

future outlook 

we expect during 2016 that project k and zerobased budgeting savings will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses our foods and the categories in which we compete we expect currencyneutral comparable net sales growth to be in the range of 1 to 3 percent while our original 2016 guidance always included pricing to cover the impact of inflation in venezuela our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation while it is difficult to predict pricing actions that will be required in venezuela it is possible that currencyneutral comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to venezuela 

we also expect currencyneutral comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to deflation resulting from material costs savings from project k and zerobased budgeting this expectation for currencyneutral comparable gross margin excludes the impact of highly inflationary economies finally we expect currencyneutral comparable operating profit growth in the range of 4 to 6 percent and currencyneutral comparable eps to increase in the range of 6 to 8 percent 

we expect that fullyear operating cash flow will be approximately 11 billion including capital spending in the range of 4 to 5 percent of net sales this capital spending expectation reflects much lower capital spending for project k but increased capital spending to support growth in our pringles business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 13  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble and 

in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2015 was 12 billion representing a settlement receivable of 13 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2014 was 764 million representing a settlement receivable of 23 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have become a settlement obligation of 77 million at yearend 2015 and the settlement receivable at yearend 2014 would have become a settlement obligation of 53 million these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela is considered a highly inflationary economy as such the functional currency for our operations in venezuela is the us dollar which in turn requires bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities to be remeasured into us dollars using an exchange rate at which such balances could be settled as of the balance sheet date in addition revenues and expenses are recorded in us dollars at an appropriate rate on the date of the transaction gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in earnings 

during 2015 we have experienced an increase in the amount of time it takes to exchange bolivars for us dollars through the cencoex exchange given this economic backdrop and upon review of current us dollar cash needs in our venezuela operations as of the quarter ended july 4 2015 we concluded that we are no longer able to obtain sufficient us dollars on a timely basis through the cencoex exchange to support our venezuela operations resulting in a decision to remeasure our venezuela subsidiarys financial statements using the simadi rate please refer to note 15  for more information regarding our operations in venezuela and our change in foreign exchange rates 

as of july 4 2015 certain nonmonetary assets related to our venezuelan subsidiary continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates as these assets were utilized by our venezuelan subsidiary during the second half of 2015 they were recognized in the income statement at historical exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact during 2015 we recognized expense related to the utilization of a portion of these nonmonetary assets resulting in an unfavorable impact of approximately 17 million we expect an additional unfavorable impact of approximately 4 million in 2016 related to the utilization of these remaining nonmonetary assets including these impacts the total impact of moving from the cencoex official rate to the simadi rate is anticipated to be 173 million on a pretax basis with 169 million recognized in 2015 or approximately 42 on a fullydiluted eps basis plus an additional 4 million expected to be recognized in 2016 

in february 2016 the venezuelan government announced a 59 devaluation of the cencoex official rate from 63 bolivars to 100 bolivars to the us dollar additionally the sicad exchange rate was eliminated these changes are not expected to have a material impact on our results as we are currently using the simadi rate to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2014 we entered into forward starting interest swaps with notional amounts totaling €500 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt to be used for general corporate purposes these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges during 2015 these forward starting interest swaps were settled and additional forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling €600 million were entered into and were designated as cash flow hedges these forward starting interest rate swaps were settled in march 2015 upon the issuance of fixed rate debt a resulting aggregate loss of 12 million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and will be amortized as interest expense over the life 

of the related fixed rate debt refer to note 7  within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the fixed rate debt issuance 

during 2015 we entered into new interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling approximately 20 billion that were designated as fair value hedges of certain us dollar notes additionally during 2015 we terminated interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling approximately 43 billion which were previously designated as fair value hedges of certain us dollar notes refer to note 7  within notes to consolidated financial statements 

there were no outstanding interest rate swaps as of yearend 2015 the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2014 was 3 billion representing a settlement obligation of 12 million as there were no interest rate swaps or variable rate debt outstanding at yearend 2015 changes in interest rates would have no impact to annual interest expense assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 36 million at yearend 2014 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat potato flakes soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2015 was 470 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 43 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2014 was 492 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 56 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 27 million at yearend 2015 and 31 million at yearend 2014 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 we had no collateral posting requirements related to reciprocal collateralization agreements as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 we posted 51 million and 50 million respectively in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

customers our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2014 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 3 2015 approximately 19 of our consolidated receivables balance and 28 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2014 during 2014 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47 of us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program project k 

in november 2013 the company announced a global fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program project k the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the project may not advance our business strategy as expected as a result we may not be able to 

  

implement project k as planned including realizing in full or in part the anticipated benefits from our program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of project k will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans 

  

then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2014 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 3 2015 approximately 19 of our consolidated receivables balance and 28 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2014 during 2014 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation regardless of the information’s accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs as well as our use of social media if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes possible us tax reform and contemplated changes in the uk and other countries of longstanding tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances 

we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and 

  

penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the us such international earnings would be subject to us tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

we also need to comply with new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities or products both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutritional assistance program to purchase certain of our products we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax anticorruption standards advertising and claims and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety labeling or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have 

  

a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental food quality and safety antitrust and trade advertising and claims and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws for example our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect 

  

our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of january 3 2015 we had total debt of approximately 74 billion and total kellogg company equity of 28 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying 

  

value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings factors which could result in an impairment include but are not limited to i reduced demand for our products ii higher commodity prices iii lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition and iv significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of january 3 2015 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 73 billion of which 50 billion was goodwill and 23 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 151 billion and total kellogg company equity of 28 billion 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with wellbranded products as well as retailer and other economy brands our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

  

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 39 of our 2014 and 2013 net sales and 37 of our 2012 net sales outside the united states we manufacture our products in 20 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand we could also be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the ukba or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and currency volatility our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we manage our operations through eight operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics products production processes types or classes of customers distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments we report results of operations in the following reportable segments us morning foods us snacks us specialty north america other europe latin america and asia pacific the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in note 16 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets in february 2015 we announced a change to our longterm annual growth target for comparable net sales our targeted longterm annual growth for comparable net sales is now lowsingledigit 1 to 3 this target was previously 3 to 4 our longterm annual growth targets continue to be midsingledigit 4 to 6 for comparable operating profit and highsingledigit 7 to 9 for currencyneutral comparable diluted net earnings per share 

during 2013 we announced project k a fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program the program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings once all phases are approved and implemented that will be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business we expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues gross margin operating profit and cash flow see the restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information 

comparability 

comparability of certain financial measures is impacted significantly by several types of charges or benefits such as pringles integration costs pension and commodity marktomarket adjustments project k costs differences in shipping days and other costs impacting comparability to provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance we use nongaap financial measures within mda that exclude the impact of these charges or benefits 

these nongaap financial measures include comparable net sales comparable gross margin comparable gross profit comparable sga comparable operating margin comparable operating profit comparable income taxes comparable effective tax rate comparable net income attributable to kellogg company comparable basic earnings per share eps comparable diluted eps and comparable diluted eps growth 

the currencyneutral comparable eps and currencyneutral comparable eps growth nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of foreign currency translation in addition to pringles integration costs pension and commodity marktomarket adjustments project k costs differences in shipping days and other costs impacting comparability 

the comparable net sales growth and comparable operating profit growth nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of acquisitions and dispositions in addition to foreign currency translation pringles integration costs pension and commodity marktomarket adjustments project k costs differences in shipping days and other costs impacting comparability 

financial results 

for the full year 2014 our reported net sales decreased by 14 and comparable net sales decreased by 20 we experienced comparable net sales declines in our developed cereal businesses and our us snacks business comparable net sales grew in latin america and asia pacific reported operating profit declined by 639 and comparable operating profit declined by 39 the decline in comparable operating profit was driven by reduced sales lower production volume and higher distribution costs this was partially offset by discipline in overhead control and reduced incentive compensation to align with performance 

reported diluted eps of 175 was down 646 compared to the prior year of 494 comparable diluted eps of 381 was down 10 compared to the prior year of 385 and was in line with our expectations

2014 compared to 2013 

the following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2014 versus 2013 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

us morning foods 

comparable net sales for us morning foods declined 57 as a result of unfavorable volume and pricingmix this segment consists of cereal toaster pastries health and wellness bars and beverages 

the cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind categorybuilding programs that started early in the year much of our decline in the cereal category has come from special k ® and kashi ®  we experienced weakness in special k ® as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer trends regarding weight management as a result we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness this focus will stress the role that special k ® plays in a healthy lifestyle we have also identified areas of focus for kashi ® which is a great brand in a category that is on trend we have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the following initiatives 

 

  

  

  

 we expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the special k ® and kashi ® brands and on the cereal business as a whole our plan for investment is longterm and the levels content and effectiveness of the support will evolve and increase over time 

toaster pastries reported a sales decline for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013 however we did gain share for the year and introduced a new pbj innovation in november and we expect this to improve sales results in 2015 health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year 

comparable operating profit in us morning foods declined 108 due to the unfavorable sales performance and a midsingledigit increase in cereal brandbuilding investment this was partially offset by a decrease in brandbuilding investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages and continued cost discipline 

us snacks 

comparable net sales in us snacks declined 24 as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricingmix this segment consists of crackers cereal bars cookies savory snacks and fruitflavored snacks 

crackers posted a slight sales increase and gained share as a result of the continued success of cheezit ® innovations and core products in the town house ®  and club ® brands due to brandbuilding support and sales execution cheezit ®  town house ®  and club ® all reported solid consumption and share gains the gains in these three brands have been offset by weakness in special k ® cracker chips due to similar consumer trends that we have experienced in the cereal category we have addressed this weakness by launching completely restaged cracker chips with new flavors better flavor and texture profiles improved packaging and new positioning this new product started to arrive in stores in late december 

the bars business declined due to weakness in the special k ® and fiber plus ® brands the issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category to address these issues we launched new products and activities in the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new greattasting special k ® snack bars with new packaging and new positioning this activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world this new product started to arrive in stores in late december rice krispies treats ® and nutrigrain ® both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation we expect this segment to remain challenging into the first half of 2015 

the cookies business declined resulting in lost share however we saw share gains from chips deluxe ® as a result of new cobranded products we experienced soft performance in our 100calorie packs business throughout the year we are migrating consumers to an expanded line of singleserve products which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in 2015 we also experienced the negative impact of a sku rationalization initiative with impacts expected to continue into early 2015 

savory snacks reported midsingledigit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business grab ‘n go and the new pringles ® tortilla product 

comparable operating profit in us snacks declined by 87 due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation this was partially offset by continued cost discipline 

  

us specialty 

comparable net sales in us specialty declined 14 as a result of decreased volume and unfavorable pricingmix sales declines were the result of the negative impact of weather early in the year supply issues with a copacker and an inventory deload as a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery 

comparable operating profit in us specialty declined by 13 due to the unfavorable sales performance this was partially offset by cost discipline 

north america other 

comparable net sales in north america other us frozen and canada declined 18 due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricingmix the us frozen business reported a decline due to unfavorable comparisons early in the year resulting from strong prioryear growth behind innovation activity and costs later in the year associated with the launch of new products new eggo ® bites and eggo ® handheld sandwiches performed well during the year the combination of the eggo ® handheld sandwiches and good results from our special k ® handheld sandwiches resulted in a doubledigit sales increase for our sandwich business during our final quarter of the year consumption of eggo ® waffles is improving as we have relaunched the l’eggo my eggo ® brandbuilding program and launched eggo ® glutenfree and a new variety of thicknfluffy waffles canada reported a slight increase in sales driven primarily by the snacks business as volumes increased at a low singledigit rate 

comparable operating profit in north america other declined 52 primarily due to unfavorable sales performance this was partially offset by continued cost discipline 

europe 

comparable net sales for europe declined 07 as a result of flat volume and unfavorable pricingmix cereal category consumption remains soft in most developed markets similar to the cereal category in the us emerging markets reported good growth for the year in both cereal and snacks to address the cereal category softness we executed brandbuilding activities in the second half of the year and we plan to launch new products and brandbuilding efforts in the first quarter of 2015 new special k ® advertising has recently gone on air which addresses the recent health and wellness trends that have negatively impacted this brand 

savory snacks performed well throughout the year with the final quarter of 2014 reporting the highest sales since we acquired the business new products are launching including pringles ® tortilla and we have more capacity coming online midyear 

comparable operating profit in europe improved 78 due to net cost deflation including strong productivity savings and decreased brandbuilding investment this was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance 

latin america 

latin america’s comparable net sales improved 39 due to favorable pricingmix which was partially offset by decreased volume strong price realization primarily from venezuela has more than offset sales declines early in the year resulting from the volume elasticity impact of the introduction of a new food tax in mexico we reported growth in venezuela mercosur and the pringles business as well as pricing gains in a majority of our markets the cereal business posted good results although we saw some competitive price promotions in mexico which affected selected segments the momentum of the savory snacks business continues driven by strong commercial programs innovation and good execution 

comparable operating profit in latin america improved by 85 due to favorable sales performance which was partially offset by net cost inflation increased brandbuilding investment to support innovation and new programs and increased overhead investment 

asia pacific 

comparable net sales in asia pacific increased 07 as a result of flat volume and favorable pricingmix the sales increase was the result of doubledigit growth in the asian markets and highsingledigit growth in the savory snacks business across the region this sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the australian cereal category and our performance in south africa as we conducted construction work early in the year and it took longer than expected to bring the plant back on line 

comparable operating profit in asia pacific declined 92 due to the weakness in the australian cereal category and our performance in south africa this was partially offset by cost discipline 

corporate 

comparable operating profit for corporate improved as a result of reduced pension costs which was partially offset by increased overhead investments

comparable operating profit in europe improved due to reduced investment in consumer promotions and advertising along with overhead cost containment these benefits were partially offset by increased commodity costs 

latin america 

comparable net sales in latin america increased 55 due to a strong increase in pricingmix partially offset by a decline in volume latin america experienced growth in both cereal and snacks cereal performed very well in venezuela and brazil the snacks business growth was primarily the result of strong results from our pringles ® brand

our comparable gross profit comparable sga and comparable operating profit measures are reconciled to the directly comparable us gaap measures as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 restructuring and cost reduction activities 

we view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

project k 

the most recent and largest program that is currently active is project k a fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program announced in november 2013 the program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that will be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business the company expects that this investment will drive future growth in revenues gross margin operating profit and cash flow 

the focus of the program is to strengthen existing businesses in core markets increase growth in developing and emerging markets and drive an increased level of valueadded innovation the program is expected to provide a number of benefits including an optimized supply chain infrastructure the implementation of global business services and a new global focus on categories 

we currently anticipate that the program will result in total pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented of 12 to 14 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital expenditures estimated to be 900 million to 11 billion cash expenditures after tax and including incremental capital of approximately 300 million have been incurred since inception of the program total cash expenditures as defined are expected to be approximately 350 million in 2015 and the balance of 250 to 450 million thereafter we currently expect the charges will consist of assetrelated costs totaling 450 to 500 million which will consist primarily of asset impairments accelerated depreciation and other exitrelated costs employeerelated costs totaling 425 to 475 million which will include severance pension and other termination benefits and other costs totaling 325 to 425 million which will consist primarily of charges related to the design and implementation of global business capabilities a significant portion of other costs are the result of the implementation of global business service centers which are intended to simplify and standardize business support processes the timing and costs of these projects may change over time 

we expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately 425 to 475 million by 2018 with approximately twothirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold we have realized approximately 80 million of savings since the inception of the program and expect 90 to 100 million of savings in 2015 approximately twothirds of which will come from cost of goods sold cost savings will be reinvested into the business through additional investments in advertising instore execution and in the design and quality of our products we will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

as a result of project k we anticipate that capital spending will be impacted at least through the end of fiscal year 2015 our current business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 34 of net sales annually through the end of fiscal year 2015 capital spending is expected to be approximately 45 as a result of project k activities 

due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and shortterm debt 

we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis 

we currently expect that total pretax charges related to project k will impact reportable segments as 

  

follows us morning foods approximately 18 us snacks approximately 12 us specialty approximately 1 north america other approximately 5 europe approximately 13 latin america approximately 3 asiapacific approximately 6 and corporate approximately 42 a majority of the costs impacting corporate relate to additional initiatives to be approved and executed in the future when these initiatives are fully defined and approved we will update estimated costs by reportable segment as needed 

since inception of project k we have recognized charges of 506 million that have been attributed to the program the charges comprised of 2 million as a reduction of revenue 326 million being recorded in cogs and 178 million recorded in sga total charges for project k in 2015 are expected to be approximately 400 to 450 million 

all projects 

during 2014 we recorded 298 million of charges associated with all cost reduction initiatives the charges were comprised of 2 million being recorded as a reduction of revenue 152 million being recorded in cogs and 144 million recorded in sga expense 

we recorded 250 million of costs in 2013 associated with all cost reduction initiatives the charges were comprised of 195 million being recorded in cogs and 55 million recorded in sga expense 

during 2012 we recorded 56 million of costs associated with other cost reduction initiatives the charges were comprised of 43 million being recorded in cogs and 13 million recorded in sga expense 

the tables below provide the details for the charges incurred during 2014 2013 and 2012 and program costs to date for programs currently active as of january 3 2015 

 

 employee related costs consisted of severance and pension charges asset impairments were recorded for fixed assets that were determined to be impaired and were written down to their estimated fair value see note 12 for more information asset related costs consist primarily of accelerated depreciation other costs incurred consist primarily of thirdparty incremental costs related to the development and implementation of global business capabilities 

at january 3 2015 total exit cost reserves were 110 million related to severance payments and other costs of which a substantial portion will be paid in 2015 and 2016 the following table provides details for exit cost reserves 

 

  

 foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

  

interest expense 

annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table the declines in both 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to refinancing of maturing longterm debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on longterm debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 20148 20137 20129 we currently expect that our 2015 gross interest expense will be approximately 215 to 225 million 

 

 income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 226 304 and 274 respectively comparable effective tax rates for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 282 284 and 284 respectively the impact of discrete adjustments on the reported effective income tax rate was a reduction of 6 percentage points for 2014 less than 1 percentage point reduction for 2013 and a reduction of 3 percentage points for 2012 

the 2014 effective income tax rate benefited from the marktomarket loss recorded for our pension plans the 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 we had 257 million and 255 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations these amounts include 68 million and 42 million at january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 respectively subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to 1793 million a decrease of 14 million compared with 2013 the decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative impact of project k cash requirements totaling 256 million partially offset by improved performance in core working capital which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative of approximately 210 million our net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 amounted to 1807 million an increase of 49 million compared with 2012 reflecting improved performance in core and other working capital 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory excluding inventoriable marktomarket pension costs and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 27 days and 30 days for 2014 and 

  

2013 respectively core working capital in 2014 averaged 76 of net sales compared to 78 in both 2013 and 2012 core working capital in 2014 showed improvements in days of inventory on hand excluding inventoriable marktomarket pension costs and days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative partially offset by higher trade receivables 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 53 million 48 million and 51 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2021 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2015 of approximately 55 million actual 2015 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 the increase in cash flow as defined in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core working capital partially offset by the negative impact of project k cash requirements the decrease in cash flow in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to higher capital expenditures 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2014 amounted to 573 million a decrease of 68 million compared with 2013 primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures 

capital spending in 2014 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products including india and pringles 

net cash used in investing activities of 641 million in 2013 decreased by 2604 million compared with 2012 due to the acquisition of pringles in 2012 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 40 in 2014 from 43 in 2013 which was an increase from 38 in 2012 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 1063 million and 1141 million for 2014 and 2013 respectively compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1317 million for 2012 the use of cash in financing activities in 2014 and 2013 compared to the providing of cash from financing activities in 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles 

total debt was 74 billion at both yearend 2014 and 2013 

in march 2014 we redeemed 150 million of our 400 us dollar notes due 2020 342 million of our 3125 us dollar notes due 2022 and 189 million of our 275 us dollar notes due 2023 in connection with the debt redemption we incurred 1 million of interest expense offset by 8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and incurred 5 million expense recorded in other income expense net related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer 

in may 2014 we issued € 500 million of sevenyear 175 euro notes due 2021 using the proceeds for general corporate purposes which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings 

in may 2014 we issued cdn 300 million of threeyear 205 canadian dollar notes due 2017 using the proceeds together with cash on hand to repay our cdn 300 million 210 notes due may 2014 at maturity 

in february 2013 we issued 250 million of twoyear floatingrate us dollar notes and 400 million of tenyear 275 us dollar notes resulting in 

  

aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 645 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including together with cash on hand repayment of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 425 us dollar notes due march 2013 

in may 2012 we issued 350 million of threeyear 1125 us dollar notes 400 million of fiveyear 175 us dollar notes and 700 million of tenyear 3125 us dollar notes resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 1442 billion the proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes including financing a portion of the acquisition of pringles 

in may 2012 we issued cdn 300 million of twoyear 210 fixed rate canadian dollar notes using the proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes which included repayment of intercompany debt this repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of pringles 

in december 2012 we repaid 750 million fiveyear 5125 us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 

in april 2010 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 25 billion during 2010 through 2012 under this program we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock for 63 million during 2012 

in december 2012 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 300 million during 2013 in april 2013 the board of directors approved a 1 billion share repurchase program expiring in april 2014 in february 2014 the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 15 billion in shares through december 2015 this authorization supersedes the april 2013 authorization and is intended to allow us to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs during 2014 we purchased 11 million shares totaling 690 million in may 2013 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid 355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through august 2013 the total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the asr was based upon the volume weighted average price of the company’s stock over the term of the agreement total shares purchased in 2013 including shares delivered under the asr amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling 544 million 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 190 per share in 2014 180 per share in 2013 and 174 per share in 2012 total cash paid for dividends increased by 40 in 2014 and 50 in 2013 in february 2015 the board of directors declared a dividend of 49 per common share payable on march 18 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 6 2015 

in february 2014 we entered into an unsecured fiveyear credit agreement to replace the existing unsecured fouryear credit agreement which would have expired in march 2015 the fiveyear credit agreement allows us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in february 2019 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of january 3 2015 we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 3 2015 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an 

  

amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at january 3 2015 we have property plant and equipment of 38 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 79 million of idle assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process our 2012 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the pringles acquisition on may 31 2012 to comply with the requirement that all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment within one year of acquisition intangible assets recognized as part of the pringles acquisition were tested for impairment during the second quarter of 2013 in addition to the evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2013 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2014 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at january 3 2015 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 73 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 22 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the us snacks reporting unit was approximately 59 and 57 in 2014 and 2013 respectively however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses additionally we have 33 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately 35 in 2014 and 2013 if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation this could have resulted in an impairment loss for example if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by 400 basis points this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit management will continue to monitor the situation closely 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to 

  

use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates the mortality table and improvement scale and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 69 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2015 of 85 equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 31 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 3 2015 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2015 benefits expense by approximately 60 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 201441 2013545 2012–211 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 471 our initial trend rate for 2015 of 500 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 025 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at january 3 2015 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2015 benefits expense by approximately 15 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 169 million a 100 basis point excess of 2015 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 9 million and would increase 2015 expense by 04 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2014 claims experience was approximately 20 million 

assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize on october 27 2014 the society of actuaries’ soa published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale which both reflect improved longevity in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of january 3 2015 we considered the soa’s updated mortality tables as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates the change to the mortality assumption increased the yearend pension and postretirement benefit obligations by 126 million and 33 million respectively 

  

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at january 3 2015 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2015 benefits expense by approximately 3 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 263 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience during 2014 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 918 million compared to a net actuarial gain of approximately 1097 million in 2013 of the total net loss recognized in 2014 approximately 911 million was related primarily to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions 41 million was related to asset losses and 34 million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs of the 1097 million net gain recognized in 2013 approximately 552 million was related to favorable changes in the discount rate and 545 million of asset gains 

during 2014 we made contributions in the amount of 37 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 16 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services to achieve that core principle an entity would be required to apply the following five steps 1 identify the contracts with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is not permitted entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method recognizing the cumulative effect of the asu in retained earnings at the date of initial application an entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the asu as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change as well as reasons for significant changes we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this 

  

asu will have on our financial statements and disclosures as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption 

future outlook 

we expect during 2015 that project k will enable us to begin to increase investment in certain businesses and the categories in which we compete we expect comparable net sales growth to be approximately flat comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to net cost deflation comparable operating profit to decline by 2 to 4 percent and currencyneutral comparable eps to be in a range from flat to down 2 percent 

as a result of 2014 incentive compensation being reduced to align with performance and the anticipated reestablishment of usual incentive compensation levels in 2015 we expect that increased incentive compensation will result in a 34 headwind for fullyear results in 2015 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar canadian dollar venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2014 was 764 million representing a settlement receivable of 23 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2013 was 517 million representing a settlement obligation of 1 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have become a settlement obligation of 53 million at yearend 2014 and the settlement obligation at yearend 2013 would have increased by approximately 52 million these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced a 465 devaluation of the official cadivi now named cencoex exchange rate from 43 bolivars to 63 bolivars to the us dollar additionally the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme used between may 2010 and january 2013 to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars was eliminated accordingly in february 2013 we began using the cencoex exchange rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars and in 2013 we recognized a 15 million charge as a result of the devaluation of the cencoex exchange rate the cencoex exchange is restricted to some raw materials finished goods and machinery for sectors considered as national priorities which is primarily food and medicines 

in march 2013 the venezuelan government announced a new auctionbased currency transaction program referred to as sicad1 sicad1 allows entities in specific sectors to bid for us dollars to be used for specified import transactions with the minimum exchange rate to be offered being 63 bolivars to the us dollar as of january 3 2015 the published sicad1 rate offered was 120 bolivars to the us dollar and availability of us dollars at either exchange rate continues to be limited 

in january 2014 the venezuelan government announced the expansion of the sicad1 auction program to prospective dividends and royalties and new profit margin controls as our venezuelan subsidiary declares dividends or pays royalties in the future based on the availability of us dollars exchanged under the sicad1 program the realized 

  

exchange losses on payments made in us dollars would be recognized in earnings on profit margin controls we continue to ensure we are complying with the requirements 

in february 2014 the venezuelan government announced plans to launch a third foreign exchange mechanism known as sicad2 which became operational on march 24 2014 sicad2 relies on us dollar cash and us dollar denominated bonds offered by the venezuelan central bank pdvsa the national oil and gas company and private companies the venezuelan government has allowed that all industry sectors will be able to access sicad2 and indicated that its use will not be restricted as to purpose as of january 3 2015 the published sicad2 rate was 510 bolivars to the us dollar 

in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced plans to launch a new foreign exchange mechanism known as simadi which is expected to become operational in 2015 the simadi exchange mechanism which will replace sicad2 has been reported to be an open market in which rates will be determined based on supply and demand 

in light of the current difficult macroeconomic environment in venezuela we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment and exposures in venezuela our venezuelan business does not rely heavily on imports and when items are imported they are largely exchanged at the cencoex rate as of january 3 2015 we translated our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars using the cencoex exchange rate we will continue to monitor local conditions our continued ability to obtain us dollars at the cencoex exchange rate and the use if applicable of the sicad1 sicad2 or simadi once operational mechanisms to determine the appropriate rate for translation for fiscal year 2014 venezuela represented approximately 2 of total net sales and 3 of total comparable operating profit as of january 3 2015 our net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar were approximately 100 million in us dollars applying the cencoex exchange rate if the cencoex exchange rate were to devalue further or if the currently less favorable sicad1 exchange rate were extended to apply to a greater portion of our net monetary assets in venezuela we would recognize a devaluation charge in earnings the potential unfavorable fully diluted eps impact of adopting the sicad1 exchange rate at the current rate of 120 bolivars to the us dollar would be approximately 12 for the revaluation of our net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar at january 3 2015 and approximately 06 for the translation of forecasted aftertax operating profit during 2015 the potential unfavorable fully diluted eps impact of adopting the sicad2 exchange rate at the current rate of 510 bolivars to the us dollar would be approximately 21 for the revaluation of our net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar at january 3 2015 and approximately 12 for the translation of forecasted aftertax operating profit during 2015 we continue to monitor the currency developments in venezuela and take protective measures against currency devaluation which may include converting monetary assets into nonmonetary assets which we can use in our business 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

in 2014 and prior years we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes refer to disclosures contained in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements during 2014 we entered into forward starting interest swaps with notional amounts totaling € 500 million approximately 600 million usd as of january 3 2015 as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt to be used for general corporate purposes these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges 

the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2014 was 3 billion representing a settlement obligation of 12 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2013 was 24 billion representing a settlement obligation of 59 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 36 million at yearend 2014 and 35 million at yearend 2013 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing 

  

processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 42 million as of january 3 2015 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period at yearend december 28 2013 the notional amount was 63 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2014 including the north america natural gas swaps was 492 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 56 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2013 including the natural gas swaps was 361 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 32 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 31 million at yearend 2014 and 18 million at yearend 2013 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of january 3 2015 we had no collateral posting requirements related to reciprocal collateralization agreements as of december 28 2013 we had posted collateral of 9 million in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 we posted 50 million and 12 million respectively in margin deposits for exchangetraded commodity derivative instruments which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure under rules 13a15e and 15d15e disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable rather than absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives 

as of january 3 2015 management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

b pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we have included a report of management’s assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as part of this annual report on form 10k the independent registered public accounting firm of pricewaterhousecoopers llp also attested to and reported on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting management’s report and the independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation report are included in our 2014 financial statements in item 8 of this report under the captions entitled “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” and “report of independent registered public accounting firm” and are incorporated herein by reference 

c during the fourth quarter of 2014 we completed a significant upgrade to and reimplementation of our existing enterprise resource planning erp system within north america the implementation which began in 2012 resulted in the modification of certain business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting during the implementation we took the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls around financial reporting 

during the third quarter of 2014 we went live with the first phase of our global business services gbs initiative in conjunction with project k which includes the reorganization and relocation of certain financial service processes internal to the organization this initiative is expected to continue through 2016 and will impact the design of our control framework during the transition to gbs we have put additional controls in place to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls impacting financial reporting 

there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

generally have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2 10net 11 or 1 15net 16 receipts from goods sold supplemented as required by borrowings provide for our payment of dividends repurchases of our common stock capital expansion and for other operating expenses and working capital needs

backlog for the most part orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders at december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 was not material to us 

competition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories both domestically and internationally our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products which are typically distributed at lower prices and generally with other food products principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions product quality taste convenience nutritional value price advertising and promotion

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

  

we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program project k 

in november 2013 the company announced a global fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program project k the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers business partners and other stakeholders in addition the project may not advance our business strategy as expected as a result we may not be able to implement project k as planned including realizing in full or in part the anticipated benefits from our program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the complexity of project k will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements many of our employees are covered by collectivelybargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectivelybargained agreements strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could adversely impact our operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency 

  

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2013 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 28 2013 approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 30 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2013 during 2013 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 45 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

our profits earned outside the us are generally taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the us such international earnings would be subject to us tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active for example in mexico or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time for example in october 2012 we initiated a recall of certain packages of miniwheats cereal due to the possible presence of fragments of flexible metal mesh from a faulty manufacturing part we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities outside the united states international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies in addition legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed and less certain these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change sometimes dramatically as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising product or production requirements labeling import or export of our products or ingredients relations with distributors and retailers health and safety the environment and restrictions on the use of government programs such as supplemental nutrition assistance program to purchase certain of our products we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax 

  

anticorruption standards and environmental matters the need to comply with new evolving or revised tax environmental food quality and safety or other laws or regulations or new evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pringles acquisition or in the expected time frame 

the overall success of the pringles acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining and integrating the pringles business into our existing business we may not be able to fully achieve these objectives or may not be able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis and the anticipated future benefits and synergies therefore may not be realized fully or at all we may also incur unanticipated costs the acquisition involves challenges and risks including risks that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or that we will not realize a satisfactory return any integration difficulties could decrease or eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pringles acquisition and could negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental food quality and safety antitrust and trade and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in 

  

response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of december 28 2013 we had total debt of approximately 74 billion and total kellogg company equity of 35 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions 

  

may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 28 2013 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 74 billion of which 50 billion was goodwill and 24 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 155 billion and total kellogg company equity of 35 billion 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations furthermore a significant portion of the communications between and storage of personal data of our personnel customers consumers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our sap platform or due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage furthermore if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity while 

  

we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products

comparability 

internal net sales growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and if applicable acquisitions dispositions and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the pringles ® business pringles

margin performance 

margin performance was as follows 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 underlying gross margin declined by 110 basis points in 2013 due to the impact of inflation net of productivity savings lower operating leverage due to lower sales volume and the impact of the lower margin structure of the pringles business underlying sga improved by 110 basis points as a result of favorable overhead leverage and synergies resulting from the pringles acquisition as well as reduced investment in consumer promotions 

underlying gross margin declined by 180 basis points in 2012 as a result of cost inflation net of cost savings and the lower margin structure of the pringles business underlying sga was consistent with 2011 

our underlying gross profit underlying sga and underlying operating profit measures are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 restructuring and cost reduction activities 

we view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

cost reduction initiatives 

prior to the announcement of project k in 2013 we commenced various cogs and sga cost reduction initiatives the cogs initiatives are intended to optimize our global manufacturing network reduce waste and develop best practices on a global basis the sga initiatives focus on improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of various global support functions 

during 2013 we recorded 42 million of charges associated with cost reduction initiatives the charges 

  

were comprised of 21 million being recorded in cogs and 21 million recorded in sga expense at december 28 2013 exit cost reserves were 1 million related to severance payments which will be made in 2014 

we recorded 56 million of costs in 2012 associated with cost reduction initiatives the charges were comprised of 43 million being recorded in cogs and 13 million recorded in sga expense at december 29 2012 exit cost reserves were 1 million related to severance payments

project k 

in 2013 we announced project k a fouryear efficiency and effectiveness program the program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings once all phases are approved and implemented that will be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business we expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues gross margin operating profit and cash flow 

  

the focus of the program will be to strengthen existing businesses in core markets increase growth in developing and emerging markets and drive an increased level of valueadded innovation the program is expected to provide a number of benefits including an optimized supply chain infrastructure the implementation of global business services and a new global focus on categories 

we currently anticipate that the program will result in total pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented of 12 to 14 billion with aftertax cash costs including incremental capital investments estimated to be 900 million to 11 billion cash expenditures of approximately 30 million were incurred in 2013 future cash expenditures are expected to be approximately 300 to 400 million in 2014 and the balance of 570 to 670 million thereafter we currently expect the charges will consist of assetrelated costs totaling 450 to 500 million which will consist primarily of asset impairments accelerated depreciation and other exitrelated costs employeerelated costs totaling 425 to 475 million which will include severance pension and other termination benefits and other costs totaling 325 to 425 million which will consist primarily of charges related to the design and implementation of global business capabilities a significant portion of other costs are the result of the implementation of global business service centers which are intended to simplify and standardize business support processes 

we currently expect that total pretax charges will impact reportable segments as follows us morning foods approximately 17 us snacks approximately 7 us specialty approximately 1 north america other approximately 3 europe approximately 7 latin america approximately 2 asiapacific approximately 6 and corporate approximately 57 a majority of the costs impacting corporate relate to additional initiatives to be executed after 2014 that are currently not fully defined as the development of these initiatives is completed we will update our estimated costs by reportable segment as needed 

we expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately 425 to 475 million by 2018 with approximately twothirds the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold we realized 15 million of savings in 2013 and expect 50 to 60 million of savings in 2014 approximately 40 of which will come from cost of goods sold cost savings will be reinvested into the business through additional investments in advertising instore execution and in the design and quality of our products we will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets and in global category teams 

as a result of project k we anticipate that capital spending will be impacted for at least the next two 

  

years our current business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 34 of net sales annually for the next two years capital spending is expected to be approximately 45 as a result of project k activities 

due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and shortterm debt 

we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the underlying income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis 

in 2013 we recognized charges of 208 million that have been attributed to the program the charges comprised of 174 million being recorded in cogs and 34 million recorded in sga the tables below outline the details of these charges 

project k 

 

  

 employee related costs consisted of severance and pension charges asset impairments were recorded for fixed assets that were determined to be impaired and were written down to their estimated fair value asset related costs relate primarily to accelerated depreciation other costs incurred during the year ended december 28 2013 consist primarily of thirdparty incremental costs related to the development and implementation of global business capabilities 

at december 28 2013 exit cost reserves for project k were 77 million related to severance payments and other costs of which a substantial portion will be paid in 2014 and 2015 the following table provides details for project k exit cost reserves 

  

  

 foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar and canadian dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table the decline in 2013 was primarily due to refinancing of maturing longterm debt at lower interest rates and lower interest rates on longterm debt which has effectively been converted to floating rate obligations through the use of interest rate swaps the increase in 2012 was primarily due to increased debt levels associated with the acquisition of pringles partially offset by lower interest rates on our longterm debt interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 20137 20129 201111 we currently expect that our 2014 gross interest expense will be approximately 225 to 235 million 

 

   

  

income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2013 2012 and 2011 were 304 274 and 270 respectively underlying effective tax rates for 2013 2012 and 2011 were 283 288 and 293 respectively the impact of discrete adjustments reduced our reported effective income tax rate by less than 1 percentage point for 2013 for 2012 and 2011 the impact of discrete adjustments on the reported effective income tax rate was a reduction of 3 and 5 percentage points respectively the 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 28 2013 we had 255 million of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations these amounts include 42 million at december 28 2013 subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time 

  

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 amounted to 1807 million an increase of 49 million compared with 2012 the increase compared to the prior year is primarily due to improved performance in core and other working capital our net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 amounted to 1758 million an increase of 163 million compared with 2011 reflecting improved performance in working capital including the onetime benefit of approximately 150 million derived from the pringles acquisition 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 30 days for 2013 and 2012 core working capital in 2013 and 2012 averaged 78 of net sales compared to 69 in 2011 for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 core working capital was negatively impacted by higher trade receivables offset by lower days of inventory for 2011 higher days of inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure in 2011 higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at yearend due to our innovation launches and special k ® new year’s resolution programs 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 48 million 51 million and 192 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2015 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on 

  

general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2014 of approximately 57 million actual 2014 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 the decrease in cash flow as defined in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to higher capital expenditures the increase in cash flow in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the onetime benefit derived from the pringles acquisition as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the threeyear period 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2013 amounted to 641 million a decrease of 2604 million compared with 2012 primarily attributable to the 2668 million acquisition of pringles in 2012 

capital spending in 2013 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets including pringles in addition we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform 

net cash used in investing activities of 3245 million in 2012 increased by 2658 million compared with 2011 due to the acquisition of pringles in 2012 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has increased to 43 in 2013 from 38 in 2012 which was a decrease from 45 in 2011 

financing activities 

our net cash used by financing activities was 1141 million for 2013 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1317 million for 2012 and net cash used in financing activities of 957 million for 2011 the increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2012 compared to 2013 and 2011 was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles 

total debt was 74 billion at yearend 2013 and 79 billion at yearend 2012 

in february 2013 we issued 250 million of twoyear floatingrate us dollar notes and 400 million of tenyear 275 us dollar notes resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 645 million the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including together with cash on hand repayment of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 425 us dollar notes due march 2013 

in may 2012 we issued 350 million of threeyear 1125 us dollar notes 400 million of fiveyear 175 us dollar notes and 700 million of tenyear 3125 us dollar notes resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 1442 billion the proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes including financing a portion of the acquisition of pringles 

in may 2012 we issued cdn 300 million of twoyear 210 fixed rate canadian dollar notes using the proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes which included repayment of intercompany debt this repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of pringles 

in december 2012 we repaid 750 million fiveyear 5125 us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 

in april 2011 we repaid 945 million tenyear 660 us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 

in may 2011 we issued 400 million of sevenyear 325 fixed rate us dollar notes using the proceeds of 397 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper 

in november 2011 we issued 500 million of fiveyear 1875 fixed rate u s dollar notes using the proceeds of 498 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper 

  

in april 2010 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 25 billion during 2010 through 2012 

under this program we repurchased approximately 1 million and 15 million shares of common stock for 63 million and 793 million during 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in december 2012 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 300 million during 2013 in april 2013 the board of directors approved a 1 billion share repurchase program expiring in april 2014 in february 2014 the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 15 billion in shares through december 2015 this authorization supersedes the april 2013 authorization and is intended to allow us to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs in may 2013 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid 355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through august 2013 the total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the asr was based upon the volume weighted average price of the company’s stock over the term of the agreement total purchased in 2013 including shares delivered under the asr amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling 544 million 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 180 per share in 2013 174 per share in 2012 and 167 per share in 2011 total cash paid for dividends increased by 50 in 2013 and 30 in 2012 in february 2014 the board of directors declared a dividend of 46 per common share payable on march 17 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 4 2014 

in march 2011 we entered into an unsecured fouryear credit agreement which allows us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fouryear credit agreement which expires in march 2015 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 28 2013 we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2013 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 04 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction are significant so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 28 2013 we have property plant and equipment of 39 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 54 million of idle assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process our 2012 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the pringles acquisition on may 31 2012 to comply with the requirement that all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment within one year of acquisition intangible assets recognized as part of the pringles acquisition were tested for impairment during the second quarter of 2013 in addition to the evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2013 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2013 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

  

  

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at december 28 2013 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 74 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 23 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the us snacks reporting unit was approximately 57 and 43 in 2013 and 2012 respectively however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses additionally we have 57 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately 30 in 2013 and 2012 if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation this could have resulted in an impairment loss for example if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by 200 basis points this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit management will continue to monitor the situation closely 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 68 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more 

  

likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2014 of 85 equates to approximately the 60th percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 32 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 28 2013 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2014 benefits expense by approximately 61 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2013545 2012211 2011–471 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 564 our initial trend rate for 2014 of 525 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 05 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 28 2013 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2014 benefits expense by approximately 11 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 132 million a 100 basis point excess of 2014 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 8 million and would increase 2014 expense by 04 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2013 claims experience was approximately 13 million 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 28 2013 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2014 benefits expense by approximately 1 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 212 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience during 2013 we recognized a net actuarial gain of approximately 1097 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately 445 million in 2012 of the total net gain recognized in 2013 approximately 552 million was related primarily to favorable changes in the discount rate and 545 million in asset gains of the 445 million net loss recognized in 2012 approximately 656 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate offset by approximately 211 million of asset gains in 2012 

during 2013 we made contributions in the amount of 34 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 14 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

  

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists this asu is expected to eliminate diversity in practice resulting from lack of existing guidance it applies to all entities with unrecognized tax benefits that also have tax loss or tax credit carryforwards in the same tax jurisdiction as of the reporting date the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 with early adoption permitted the amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date retrospective application is permitted we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2014 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

future outlook 

we expect during 2014 that project k will enable us to begin to increase investment in certain businesses and the categories in which we compete we expect internal net sales will increase by approximately 1 percent underlying gross margin to improve approximately 4050 basis points due to a moderate amount of deflation net of cost savings initiatives underlying internal operating profit to be flat to up 2 percent and currencyneutral comparable eps to grow by 1 to 3 percent this outlook excludes the impact of marktomarket adjustments project k costs pringles integration costs and the 53 rd week which will occur in 2014 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2013 was 517 million representing a settlement obligation of 1 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2012 was 570 million representing a settlement receivable of 1 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 52 million at yearend 2013 and the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately 57 million at yearend 2012 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings for 2012 and 2011 the impact of the translation of our 

  

venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars was not significant in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced a 465 devaluation of the official exchange rate additionally the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme used between may 2010 and january 2013 to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars was eliminated accordingly in february 2013 we began using the official exchange rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars during 2013 we recognized a 15 million charge as a result of the devaluation of the official venezuelan exchange rate at yearend 2013 our venezuela subsidiary’s bolivar fuertedenominated net monetary asset position which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation was approximately 63 million

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2013 and 2012 we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes refer to disclosures contained in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2013 was 24 billion representing a settlement obligation of 59 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2012 was 22 billion representing a settlement receivable of 64 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 35 million at yearend 2013 and 24 million at yearend 2012 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 63 million as of december 28 2013 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period at yearend december 29 2012 the notional amount was 84 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2013 including the north america natural gas swaps was 361 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 32 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2012 including the natural gas swaps was 320 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 36 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 18 million at yearend 2013 and 9 million at yearend 2012 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of december 28 2013 we had posted collateral of 9 million in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012 we had received 8 million cash collateral from a counterparty which was reflected as a decrease in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet

c during the first quarter of 2012 we initiated the implementation of an upgrade to our existing enterprise resource planning erp system within north america this implementation has resulted in the modification of certain business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting during the implementation which is expected to continue into 2014 we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls impacting financial reporting it is anticipated that upon completion implementation of this new erp will enhance internal controls due to increased automation and further integration of related processes

competition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories both domestically and internationally our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products which are typically distributed at lower prices and generally with other food products principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions product quality taste convenience nutritional value price advertising and promotion

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time for example in october 2012 we initiated a recall of certain packages of miniwheats cereal due to the possible presence of fragments of flexible metal mesh from a faulty manufacturing part we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or 

  

processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

evolving tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising labeling relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental food quality and safety or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions termination of necessary licenses or permits or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations it could potentially create negative publicity which could harm our business or reputation 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

tax matters including changes in tax rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

our profits earned outside the us are generally taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rates the cash we generate outside the us is principally to be used to fund our international development if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the us we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the us such international earnings would be subject to us tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase 

  

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property withholding and franchise taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and nonincome based taxes inside and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liability including interest and penalties there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pringles acquisition or in the expected time frame 

the overall success of the pringles acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining and integrating the pringles business into our existing business we may not be able to fully achieve these objectives or may not be able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis and the anticipated future benefits and synergies therefore may not be realized fully or at all we may also incur unanticipated costs the acquisition involves challenges and risks including risks that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or that we will not realize a satisfactory return any integration difficulties could decrease or eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pringles acquisition and could negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under general commercial employment environmental food quality and safety antitrust and trade and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws in addition we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of december 29 2012 we had total debt of approximately 79 billion and total kellogg company equity of 24 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions globally particularly in europe may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20 of consolidated net sales during 2012 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 29 2012 approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 26 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2012 during 2012 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 45 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair 

  

value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 29 2012 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 74 billion of which 50 billion was goodwill and 24 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 152 billion and total kellogg company equity of 24 billion 

our postretirement benefitrelated costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions 

increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and postretirement plan assets potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and postretirement plan assets assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions the company’s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets and interest rates in addition funding requirements for our plans may become more significant however the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and postretirement funding obligations 

multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business 

we participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans then applicable law could require us to make an additional lumpsum contribution to the plan and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and 

  

on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs furthermore a significant portion of the communications between our personnel customers and suppliers depends on information technology our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our sap platform or due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues moreover our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks these events could compromise our confidential information impede or interrupt our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including remediation costs loss of revenue litigation and reputational damage to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks or other security breaches to our computer systems 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands 

we have a number of iconic brands with significant value maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner adverse publicity about our products whether or not valid our failure to maintain the quality of our products the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about kellogg our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands our results could be negatively impacted

kellogg company and subsidiaries 

 

results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

for more than 100 years consumers have counted on kellogg for greattasting highquality and nutritious foods kellogg is the world’s leading producer of cereal second largest producer of cookies and crackers and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods additional product offerings include toaster pastries cereal bars fruitflavored snacks and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 

we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics products production processes types or classes of customers distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments we report results of operations in the following reportable segments us morning foods  kashi us snacks us specialty north america other europe latin america and asia pacific the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in note 16 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets these targets are 3 to 4 for internal net sales midsingledigit 4 to 6 for underlying operating profit and highsingledigit 7 to 9 for currency neutral underlying diluted net earnings per share 

internal net sales growth and internal operating profit growth exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and if applicable acquisitions dispositions and transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the pringles ® business pringles in addition to these items internal operating profit growth also includes the benefit of allocating a portion of costs related to our support functions that are now being leveraged to provide support to the pringles business 

as a result of adopting the accounting change discussed below comparability of certain financial measures is impacted significantly by the marktomarket adjustments that are recorded annually or more frequently if a remeasurement event occurs to provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our underlying operating performance we use nongaap financial measures within the mda that exclude the impact of marktomarket adjustments these nongaap financial measures include underlying gross margin underlying gross profit underlying sga underlying operating margin underlying operating profit underlying operating profit growth underlying income taxes underlying net income attributable to kellogg company underlying basic earnings per share eps underlying diluted eps and underlying diluted eps growth underlying operating profit growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation marktomarket adjustments and if applicable acquisitions dispositions and transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the pringles business 

during 2012 we completed the acquisition of the pringles business from the procter  gamble company pg for 2668 billion including working capital adjustments which was funded from cashonhand and the issuance of 23 billion of short and longterm debt 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we changed our accounting for recognizing expense for our pension and postretirement benefit plans historically we deferred actuarial gains and losses from these plans and recognized the financial impact to the income statement over several years under the new accounting method gains and losses from these plans are recognized in an annual marktomarket adjustment that is recorded in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if a remeasurement event occurs earlier in the year 

concurrent with the accounting change we have elected to modify the allocation of pension and postretirement benefit plan costs to reportable segments historically all costs for these plans were allocated to reportable segments for management evaluation and reporting purposes beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 we have included the service cost of these plans within the financial results of the reportable segments all other costs related to these plans such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and the annual marktomarket adjustment will be reported in corporate 

these changes have been applied retrospectively financial results from prior periods have been recast to include the impact as if the changes had been in place during those periods refer to note 1 within notes to 

  

consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this accounting change 

for the full year 2012 our reported net sales which includes the impact of the operating results of the pringles business since the acquisition on may 31 2012 increased by 76 and internal net sales increased by 25 in line with our expectations we experienced solid growth in north america latin america and most of asia pacific operating environments in europe continued to be difficult although we are seeing continued improvement in sales trends for the segment reported operating profit which includes the impact of the accounting change the operating results of the pringles business and transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of pringles increased by 95 underlying operating profit declined by 57 in line with our expectations and was unfavorably impacted by anticipated cost inflation the impact of the third quarter’s limited recall and increased brandbuilding investment diluted eps of 267 was up 122 compared to the prior year eps of 238 underlying eps of 352 was in line with our expectations

internal operating profit in us morning foods  kashi declined by 16 us snacks declined by 81 us specialty declined by 87 north america other grew by 95 europe declined by 161 latin america increased by 85 and asia pacific increased by 348 us morning foods  kashi’s decline was attributable to strong sales in cereal and snacks being offset by increased incentive compensation expense increased commodity costs and investments in supply chain us snacks’ decline was attributable to investments in supply chain and increased incentive compensation expense us specialty’s decline was attributable to increased commodity costs and incentive compensation expense europe’s operating profit declined due to lower sales resulting from the continued difficult operating environment and increased commodity costs the increase in latin america’s operating profit is primarily a result of higher sales partially offset by increased brandbuilding investment asia pacific’s operating profit growth was positively impacted by the prior year impairment charges related to our business in china refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the china impairment 

corporate expense 

 

 corporate expense is primarily the result of marktomarket adjustments for our pension and nonpension postretirement benefit plans these adjustments were 452 682 and 9 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the remaining changes were the result of impacts from compensationrelated expense and pensionrelated interest cost and offsetting pensionrelated expected return on plan assets 

margin performance 

margin performance was as follows 

 

   

  

  

 underlying gross margin which excludes the impact of marktomarket adjustments on pension and postretirement benefit plans declined by 180 basis points in 2012 as a result of cost inflation and the lower margin structure of the pringles business which was partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives underlying sga  which excludes the impact of marktomarket adjustments on pension and postretirement benefit plans was consistent with 2011 

underlying gross margin declined by 110 basis points in 2011 due to the expanded investments in our supply chain and increased cost pressures for fuel energy and commodities which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives underlying sga  decreased by 60 basis points primarily due to a reduction in brandbuilding investment as a percent of net sales and decreased costs related to cost reduction initiatives partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense 

our underlying gross profit underlying sga and underlying operating profit measures are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

  

  

  

 foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar and canadian dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

interest expense 

annual interest expense is illustrated in the following table the increase in 2012 was primarily due to increased debt levels associated with the acquisition of pringles partially offset by lower interest rates on our longterm debt the decline from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to lower interest rates on our longterm debt interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 20129 201111 20106 we currently expect that our 2013 gross interest expense will be approximately 230 to 240 million 

 

 income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2012 2011 and 2010 were 274 270 and 285 respectively excluding the impact of the marktomarket adjustment underlying effective tax rates for 2012 2011 and 2010 were 288 293 and 289 respectively the impact of discrete adjustments reduced our effective income tax rate by 3 percentage points for 2012 the 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested for 2011 and 2010 the impact was a reduction of 5 and 3 percentage points 

  

respectively refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 29 2012 we had 244 million of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 amounted to 1758 million an increase of 163 million compared with 2011 the increase compared to the prior year is primarily due to improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition our net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 amounted to 1595 million an increase of 587 million compared with 2010 reflecting lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and lower payments for incentive compensation partially offset by a marginal increase in core working capital in 2011 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 30 days for 2012 24 days for 2011 and 23 days for 2010 core working capital in 2012 averaged 78 of net sales compared to 69 in 2011 and 66 in 2010 during 2012 core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory during 2011 core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory and higher days of trade receivables for both 2012 and 2011 higher days of inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure in 2011 higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at yearend due to our innovation launches and special k ® new year’s resolution programs 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 51 million 192 million and 643 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2010 we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to 563 million 467 million net of tax 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2014 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2013 of approximately 60 million actual 2013 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

  

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 yearoveryear changes in cash flow as defined were driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the threeyear period 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2012 amounted to 3245 million an increase of 2658 million compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the 2668 acquisition of pringles in 2012 

capital spending in 2012 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets including pringles in addition we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform 

net cash used in investing activities of 587 million in 2011 increased by 122 million compared with 2010 reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 38 in 2012 from 45 in 2011 which was an increase from 38 in 2010 

financing activities 

in february 2013 we issued 250 million of twoyear floatingrate us dollar notes and 400 million of tenyear 275 us dollar notes the proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes including together with cash on hand repayment of the 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 425 us dollar notes due march 2013 the floatingrate notes bear interest equal to threemonth libor plus 23 basis points subject to quarterly reset the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of kellogg company and its restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions as well as a change of control provision 

our net cash provided by financing activities was 1317 for 2012 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 957 and 439 for 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles 

total debt was 79 billion at yearend 2012 and 60 billion at yearend 2011 

in march 2012 we entered into interest rate swaps on our 500 million fiveyear 1875 fixed rate us dollar notes due 2016 500 million tenyear 415 fixed rate us dollar notes due 2019 and 500 million of our 750 million sevenyear 445 fixed rate us dollar notes due 2016 the interest rate swaps effectively converted these notes from their fixed rates to floating rate obligations through maturity 

in may 2012 we issued 350 million of threeyear 1125 us dollar notes 400 million of fiveyear 175 us dollar notes and 700 million of tenyear 3125 us dollar notes resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of 1442 billion the proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes including financing a portion of the acquisition of pringles 

in may 2012 we issued cdn 300 million of twoyear 210 fixed rate canadian dollar notes using the proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes which included repayment of intercompany debt this repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of pringles 

in december 2012 we repaid 750 million fiveyear 5125 us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 

in february 2011 we entered into interest rate swaps on 200 million of our 750 million sevenyear 445 fixed rate us dollar notes due 2016 the interest rate swaps effectively converted this portion of the notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 

in april 2011 we repaid 945 million tenyear 660 us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 

in may 2011 we issued 400 million of sevenyear 325 fixed rate us dollar notes using the proceeds of 397 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper during 2011 we 

  

entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 400 million which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 

in november 2011 we issued 500 million of fiveyear 1875 fixed rate u s dollar notes using the proceeds of 498 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper during 2012 we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 

in april 2010 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 25 billion during 2010 through 2012 this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to 11 billion for 2010 and 650 million for 2009 

under this program we repurchased approximately 1 million 15 million and 21 million shares of common stock for 63 million 793 million and 11 billion during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

in december 2012 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 300 million during 2013 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 174 per share in 2012 167 per share in 2011 and 156 per share in 2010 total cash paid for dividends increased by 30 in 2012 and 34 in 2011 

in march 2011 we entered into an unsecured fouryear credit agreement which allows us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fouryear credit agreement which expires in march 2015 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets continued to experience instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty throughout this period of uncertainty we continued to have access to the us european and canadian commercial paper markets our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 2012 we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 29 2012 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 05 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately 40 of 2012 net sales therefore it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current 

  

expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 29 2012 we have property plant and equipment of 38 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 19 million of idle assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process our 2012 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the pringles acquisition on may 31 2012 pringles intangible assets will be tested for impairment in the second quarter of 2013 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2012 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at december 29 2012 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 74 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles within this total approximately 22 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows at december 29 2012 the fair value of our us snacks reporting unit excluding pringles exceeded its book value by 20 billion however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different weightedaverage cost of capital in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses additionally we have 60 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately 30 in 2012 and 2011 if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation this could have resulted in an impairment loss for example if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by 200 basis points this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit management will continue to monitor the situation closely 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit 

  

plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we elected to change our policy for recognizing expense for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits previously we recognized actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet upon each plan remeasurement amortizing them into operating results over the average future service period of active employees in these plans under the new policy we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur eliminating the amortization actuarial gains and losses will be recognized annually as of our measurement date which is our fiscal yearend or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles 

additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we will no longer use the marketrelated value of plan assets an averaging technique permitted under generally accepted accounting principles but instead will use the fair value of plan assets 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 69 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis and future return expectations although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return have generally not been revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process while our expected rate of return for 2012 of 89 was supported by historical performance and equated to approximately the 62 nd percentile of our model we have elected to lower our expected rate of return to 85 in 2013 this reduction is based on the expectation to derisk the plan investment portfolio over time and as the market allows our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2013 of 85 equates to approximately the 61st percentile expectation of our model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 31 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 29 2012 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2013 benefits expense by approximately 54 million for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2012211 2011471 2010–246 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 54 our initial trend rate for 2013 of 55 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 05 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 29 2012 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2013 benefits expense by approximately 13 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of 166 million a 100 basis point excess of 2013 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately 9 million and would increase 2013 expense by 03 million any arising health care claims 

  

costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur the experience gain arising from recognition of 2012 claims experience was approximately 11 million 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 29 2012 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2013 benefits expense by approximately 2 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of 233 million all obligationrelated actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience during 2012 we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately 445 million compared to approximately 737 million in 2011 of the total net loss recognized in 2012 approximately 656 million was related primarily to unfavorable changes in the discount rate offset by approximately 211 million in asset gains during 2012 of the 737 million net loss recognized in 2011 approximately 266 million was related to unfavorable changes in the discount rate that were partially offset by the adoption of an employer group waiver plan egwp design for prescription drug costs for the us retiree medical plan and 471 million was related to unfavorable asset performance 

during 2012 we made contributions in the amount of 38 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly nondiscretionary additionally we contributed 13 million to our retiree medical programs 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an updated accounting standard which requires companies to present information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements the updated standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2012 with early adoption permitted we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2013 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing 

in july 2012 the fasb issued an updated accounting standard to allow entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test under the updated standard an entity would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the updated standard is 

  

effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 with early adoption permitted we will adopt the updated standard in connection with our impairment evaluations to be completed in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 

future outlook 

we anticipate 2013 will be a return to our ongoing operating model in recent years we have invested in the business adjusted our strategy to focus more on growth and acquired pringles with the foundation that we have set as a result of this work we expect to realize growth in 2013 through increased investment in advertising and continued investment behind a strong lineup of innovation launches we expect reported net sales will increase by approximately 7 percent gross margin to decline approximately 50 basis points due to the fullyear impact of the pringles business reported operating profit to grow slightly more than eps and reported eps to grow by 5 to 7 percent projected eps growth includes a 012 to 014 impact from pringles integration costs this outlook excludes the impact of marktomarket adjustments on our pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as commodity contracts 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2012 was 570 million representing a settlement receivable of 1 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2011 was 13 billion representing a settlement obligation of 7 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately 57 million at yearend 2012 and the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 127 million at yearend 2011 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings as of the end of our 2009 fiscal year we used the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars in may 2010 the venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market in june 2010 several large venezuelan commercial banks began operating the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme accordingly we began using the sitme rate as of january 1 2011 to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars during 2010 we recorded a 3 million foreign exchange gain in other income expense net associated with the translation of our subsidiary’s financials into us dollars with no impact during 2012 or 2011 in february 2013 the venezuelan government announced a 465 devaluation of the official exchange rate additionally the sitme was eliminated accordingly in 2013 we will begin using the official exchange rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollar on a consolidated basis venezuela represents less than 2 of our business therefore any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs 

  

associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2012 and 2011 we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes refer to disclosures contained in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2012 was 22 billion representing a settlement receivable of 64 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2011 was 600 million representing a settlement receivable of 23 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 24 million at yearend 2012 and 18 million at yearend 2011 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 84 million as of december 29 2012 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period at yearend december 31 2011 the notional amount was 104 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2012 including the north america natural gas swaps was 136 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 36 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2011 including the natural gas swaps was 175 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 48 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 9 million at yearend 2012 and 12 million at yearend 2011 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company 

reciprocal collateralization agreements 

in some instances we have reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to us or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of december 29 2012 we had received 8 million cash collateral from a counterparty which was reflected as a decrease in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 we had posted collateral of 2 million in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet

c during the first quarter of 2012 we initiated the implementation of an upgrade to our existing enterprise resource planning erp system within north america this implementation has resulted in the modification of certain business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting during the implementation which is expected to continue into 2014 we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls impacting financial reporting it is anticipated that upon completion implementation of this new erp will enhance internal controls due to increased automation and further integration of related processes

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

  

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time for example in june 2010 we initiated a recall of certain readytoeat cereals due to an odor from waxy resins found in the package liner we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our 

  

brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

changes in tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising labeling relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental food quality and safety or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our planned acquisition of the pringles business may not occur or may not occur in the expected time frame which may negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

completion of the planned acquisition of the pringles business is not assured and is subject to risks and uncertainties including the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals are not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied if the acquisition is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the acquisition it could negatively affect the trading prices of our common stock and our future business and financial results 

we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals required to complete the pringles acquisition or in order to do so we may be required to accept material restrictions or satisfy material conditions 

  

the planned acquisition of the pringles business is subject to review by regulatory authorities and the closing of the transaction is subject to the condition that all waiting periods under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended have terminated or expired that the european commission has issued a decision under the ec merger regulation declaring that the acquisition is compatible with the common market and that all other applicable governmental approvals required under antitrust laws have been obtained the acquisition is also subject to the condition that there be no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order that would make the acquisition unlawful we can provide no assurance that these or other closing conditions will be satisfied subject to certain limitations we may be required to take certain actions in connection with obtaining antitrust clearances and other approvals and we can provide no assurance as to the cost scope or impact of the actions that may be required such actions could be detrimental to us or have the effect of delaying or preventing the acquisition 

our obligation to complete the pringles acquisition is not subject to a financing condition 

we intend to finance the acquisition in part through debt financing however our obligation to complete the acquisition is not subject to a financing condition therefore in the event that we are unable to obtain a portion of the required financing and are not otherwise able to pay the purchase price we will be in breach of the transaction agreement 

we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pringles acquisition at all or in the expected time frame 

the success of the pringles acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining and integrating the pringles business into our existing business we may not be able to achieve these objectives or may not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis and the anticipated benefits and synergies therefore may not be realized fully or at all the acquisition involves challenges and risks including risks that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or that we will not realize a satisfactory return any integration difficulties could decrease or eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pringles acquisition and could negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

we may incur substantial costs and liabilities relating to the pringles acquisition 

in connection with entering into and completing the pringles acquisition we may incur substantial costs and liabilities these include transactionrelated costs such as costs and expenses incurred in connection with integration or pursuing synergies fees to advisors fees associated with seeking regulatory approvals and other potential costs and liabilities that individually or in the aggregate could be substantial 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in defending itself in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under environmental food quality and safety and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws in addition the company could incur substantial 

  

costs and fees in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against the company and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2011 we had total debt of approximately 60 billion and total equity of 18 billion and expect to incur an additional 20 billion in debt to consummate our pending acquisition of the pringles ® business from procter  gamble co 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

current economic conditions in europe may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers this could result in reductions in sales of our products reduced acceptance of innovations and increased price competition deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and increased volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers including our suppliers comanufacturers and distributors a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20 of consolidated net sales during 2011 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 31 2011 approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 28 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2011 during 2011 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted 

  

for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 46 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 31 2011 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 51 billion of which 36 billion was goodwill and 15 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 119 billion and total equity of 18 billion an impairment charge of 20 million was recognized in 2010 representing all of the goodwill from our 2008 acquisition of a business in china 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs furthermore a significant portion of the communications between our personnel customers and suppliers depends on information technology like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions as a result of updating our sap platform or due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues we have technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure 

  

and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 we report results of operations in the following reportable segments us morning foods  kashi us snacks us specialty north america other europe latin america and asia pacific segment results of prior periods were modified to conform to the current presentation we currently manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics products production processes types or classes of customers distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail within note 16 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets these targets are 3 to 4 for internal net sales mid singledigit 4 to 6 for internal operating profit and high singledigit 7 to 9 for diluted net earnings per share eps on a currency neutral basis see the foreign currency translation section for a discussion and reconciliation of currency neutral eps a nongaap measure

net sales and operating profit 

2011 compared to 2010 

the following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2011 versus 2010 

 

  

  

 our consolidated net sales were up 6 on an as reported basis and up 4 on an internal basis behind favorable pricingmix approximately flat volume and strong results from innovations across most markets innovations and solid execution contributed to share gains in our core cereal business as well as several other key categories additionally the increased investment in our supply chain that began in 2010 and continued through 2011 is building a stronger foundation for future growth pricing was taken selectively throughout 2011 to offset the higher input costs we have experienced on many products across our categories around the world 

internal net sales for us morning foods  kashi increased 4 as a result of favorable pricingmix and approximately flat volume this business has two product groups cereal and snacks cereal’s internal net sales increased by 5 resulting from strong innovation launches and reduced reliance on promotional spending dollar sales from our innovation in 2011 equaled the dollar sales from innovation introduced by all our competitors combined snacks toaster pastries kashibranded cereal bars crackers cookies stretch island fruit snacks and health and wellness internal net sales increased by 3 as a result of doubledigit growth in health and wellness and continued share gains in our poptarts ® business 

internal net sales in us snacks increased by 6 as a result of favorable pricingmix and approximately flat volume this business consists of cookies crackers cereal bars and fruitflavored snacks the sales growth was the result of strong crackers consumption behind the launch of special k cracker chips ® and cheezit ® innovation which contributed to a solid improvement in our cracker category share sales also improved in wholesome snacks as a result of innovations in our special k ® and fiberplus ® cereal bars business cookies lowsingle digit sales growth was favorably impacted by the launch of the keebler ® master brand initiative in the second quarter which aligned pricing packaging and scale across the keebler ® brand 

internal net sales in us specialty increased by 4 as a result of favorable pricingmix and approximately flat volume sales growth was due to frozen food innovation launches and cereal bar distribution gains 

internal net sales in north america other us frozen and canada increased by 7 due to midsingledigit volume growth and favorable pricingmix sales growth was the result of our us frozen business posting doubledigit growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brandbuilding support behind innovation activity 

our international segments’ internal net sales were up 3 compared to the prior year as a result of favorable pricingmix partially offset by a decline in volume europe’s internal net sales declined 1 for the year 

  

driven by a 3 decline in volume partially offset by favorable pricingmix the operating environment in europe continued to be difficult as a result of economic conditions and competitive activity sales growth in russia was solid as we continue to transition from a nonbranded to a branded product mix latin america’s internal net sales growth was 10 due to a slight increase in volume and doubledigit increase in pricingmix latin america experienced growth in both cereal and snacks behind a middoubledigit increase in brand building investment to support innovations internal net sales in asia pacific grew 4 as a result of favorable pricingmix and approximately flat volume asia pacific’s growth was driven by strong performance across most of asia as well as south africa 

consolidated operating profit declined by 1 on an as reported basis and was down 3 on an internal basis when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by our supply chain investments commodity inflation and the reinstatement of our incentive compensation program as a result of our strong payforperformance orientation 

internal operating profit in us morning foods  kashi increased by 3 us snacks declined by 9 us specialty declined by 10 north america other grew by 14 europe declined by 13 latin america increased by 9 and asia pacific increased by 33 us morning foods  kashi’s increase was attributable to strong sales in cereal and snacks partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense increased commodity costs and investments in supply chain us snacks’ decline was attributable to investments in supply chain and increased incentive compensation expense us specialty’s decline was attributable to increased commodity costs and incentive compensation expense europe’s operating profit declined due to lower sales resulting from the continued difficult operating environment and increased commodity costs the increase in latin america’s operating profit is primarily a result of higher sales partially offset by increased brandbuilding investment asia pacific’s operating profit growth was positively impacted by the prior year impairment charges related to our business in china refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information corporate was impacted by higher compensationrelated expense 

2010 compared to 2009 

the following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2010 versus 2009 

 

  

  

   

our consolidated net sales were down 1 on both a reported and internal basis behind a 2 reduction in volume that was partially offset by favorable pricingmix there were three major issues that affected our results first our categories respond to innovation and brand building we did not have sufficient cereal innovations in 2010 rather we focused on renovating our existing cereal products we invested in renovation to improve the nutritional profile of our products secondly we experienced supply chain disruptions in our waffle business and had a second quarter recall of select packages of breakfast cereals in our us business as a result we increased investment in our supply chain to mitigate potential risks next we experienced weakness in our core cereal businesses due to the competitive environment which drove price deflation into the cereal category in late 2010 we announced price increases driven by higher input costs on many products across our categories around the world 

internal net sales for us morning foods  kashi declined 3 as a result of a 2 decline in volume and unfavorable pricingmix cereal’s internal net sales declined by 6 our consumption was negatively impacted by the cereal recall that occurred in the second quarter of 2010 the brands involved in the recall were the cornerstone of our backtoschool promotions in the third quarter promotional pricing drove deflation into the category but did not drive higher category volumes as would be expected the us cereal category responds well to innovation while there were lower levels of innovation across the category in 2010 our innovations performed well we were also impacted by less support from nonmeasured channels trade inventory levels at the end of 2009 were higher than normal as a result our 2010 sales were negatively impacted as retailers sold through their inventory reducing their purchases from us snacks internal net sales increased by 5 primarily driven by poptarts ®  

us snack’s internal net sales declined slightly as a result of a 2 decline in volume partially offset by favorable pricingmix the slight decline was driven by weak performance in cookies and to a lesser extent crackers we were able to maintain our cracker category share in measured channels despite increased competitive promotional activity consumption in the cookie category was down for the year our cookie performance was also impacted by the loss of shelf space in nonmeasured channels which we were able to regain during the fourth quarter of 2010 this decline was partially offset by strong wholesome snack sales including our bar innovations such as fiberplus ® and special k fruit crisps ®  

internal net sales in north america other decreased by 3 as a result of a 5 decline in volume partially offset by favorable pricingmix our sales were negatively impacted during the year due to the waffle supply disruption that began late in 2009 during 2010 we returned to full capacity and introduced new innovations while the business rebounded slower than expected during 2010 as it took longer to resupply and reset retailer shelves we reinstated brand building and the business responded positively our veggie business performed well particularly morningstar farms ® burgers and entrees 

our international segments’ internal net sales were flat compared to the prior year as a result of a 1 improvement in pricingmix which was offset by reduction in volume europe’s internal net sales declined 3 for the year which was primarily the result of volume decline the cereal category as measured by consumption declined in our core european countries such as the uk additionally we saw price deflation in many food categories across europe especially in the uk weakness in the russia snack business due to transition from a nonbranded business to a branded business drove lower volumes and contributed to europe’s lower top line results latin america’s internal net sales growth was 5 resulting from 8 favorable pricingmix partially offset by volume decline the growth in cereal masked the decline in snacks our decline in snacks was largely driven by venezuela where we import some products from mexico the imports were impacted by exchange rate controls and it was no longer cost efficient to import goods internal net sales in asia pacific grew 2 as a result of a 4 increase in volume partially offset by unfavorable pricingmix asia pacific’s growth was driven by strong performance across most of asia as well as south africa this was muted by a decline in australia where the cereal category faced price deflation 

consolidated operating profit declined by 1 on an as reported basis and was flat on an internal basis when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by the cereal recall higher than expected commodity inflation and investments in our supply chain operating profit benefited from lower incentive compensation expense incentive compensation is based upon the company’s actual results compared to our target given results were lower than our targets which were set at the beginning of 2010 incentive compensation decreased significantly compared to the prior year despite 2010’s operating performance we recognized the need to invest in advertising accordingly we increased our spending in advertising by 4 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 

internal operating profit in us morning foods  kashi decreased by 14 us snacks grew by 9 us specialty increased 26 north america other declined by 9 europe grew by 8 latin america declined by 2 and asia pacific declined by 30 us morning foods  kashi’s decline was attributable to lower sales in cereal competitive activity drove lower 

  

cereal sales as did the second quarter cereal recall these negative drivers were partially offset by higher sales in snacks primarily due to poptarts ®  lower incentive compensation expense and decreased spending on cost reduction initiatives us snacks’ increase was attributable to lower incentive compensation expense us specialty increased due to lower incentive compensation costs and the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives europe’s operating profit increased due to lower commodity costs and less spending on cost reduction initiatives the decline in latin america’s operating profit is primarily a result of higher commodity costs asia pacific’s operating profit was negatively impacted by the impairment charges related to our business in china refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information corporate benefited from lower incentive compensation expense 

margin performance 

margin performance was as follows 

 

  

  

 as illustrated in the preceding table our consolidated gross margin declined by 140 basis points in 2011 due to the expanded investments in our supply chain and increased cost pressures for fuel energy and commodities which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives our selling general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 30 basis points primarily due to a reduction in brandbuilding investment as a percent of net sales and decreased costs related to cost reduction initiatives partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense 

our consolidated gross margin declined by 20 basis points in 2010 due to the cereal recall increased cost pressures for fuel energy commodities and employee benefits and supply chain investments which were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and lower upfront costs recorded in cost of sales cogs our sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 40 basis points primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense and lower costs for cost reduction initiatives which more than offset increased advertising investment and an impairment of goodwill 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar and canadian dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future us dollar reported earnings as such we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis assuming earnings are translated at the prior year’s exchange rates this nongaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a useful measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 

below is a reconciliation of reported eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  

 interest expense 

annual interest expense for the 2009 to 2011 periods has trended downward the decline in 2010 was due primarily to charges of approximately 35 million in 2009 for early redemption of longterm debt and lower interest rates on our longterm debt interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 201111 20106 20094 

  

income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2011 2010 and 2009 were 290 288 and 282 respectively the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings reduced our effective income tax rate by 3 percentage points for 2011 for 2010 and 2009 the impact was a reduction of 3 and 2 percentage points respectively refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

on february 15 2012 we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire procter  gamble’s pringles ® business for 2695 billion which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately 2 billion of short and long term debt the transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2012 as such we expect to have the pringles ® business included in our results for approximately six months we plan to decrease our share repurchase program while we pay down debt but we are likely to repurchase shares to the extent of stock option exercise to offset the dilution effect we also expect to maintain a strong investmentgrade rating and are committed to reducing debt levels to rebuild our financial flexibility 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 amounted to 1595 million an increase of 587 million compared with 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and lower payments for incentive compensation partially offset by a marginal increase in core working capital in 2011 our net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 amounted to 1008 million a decrease of 635 million compared with 2009 reflecting higher pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and increased payments for advertising and promotion in 2010 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 24 days for 2011 and 23 days for each of 2010 and 2009 core working capital in 2011 averaged 69 of net sales compared to 66 in 2010 and 65 in 2009 during 2011 core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory and higher days of trade receivables higher days of inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at yearend due to our innovation launches and special k ® new year’s resolution programs during 2010 core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory needed to improve order fill levels which was compounded by the impact of lower reported sales 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 192 million 643 million and 100 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2010 we made incremental contributions to our pension and 

  

postretirement benefit plans amounting to 563 million 467 million net of tax 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2014 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2012 of approximately 50 million actual 2012 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 yearoveryear changes in cash flow as defined were driven by variations in both the amount of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and core working capital as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the threeyear period 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2011 amounted to 587 million an increase of 122 million compared with 2010 due to a higher level of capital expenditures in 2011 

capital spending in 2011 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets in addition we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform in 2010 we spent capital on our sap platform and invested in our supply chain in 2009 we invested in a new facility to manufacture readytoeat cereal in mexico and completed the expansion of our global research center one of the key incubators of innovation for our business located in battle creek michigan 

net cash used in investing activities of 465 million in 2010 increased by 95 million compared with 2009 reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has grown to 45 in 2011 from 38 in 2010 and 30 in 2009 

financing activities 

our net cash used in financing activities for 2011 2010 and 2009 amounted to 957 million 439 million and 1182 million respectively 

total debt was 60 billion at yearend 2011 and 59 billion at yearend 2010 

in april 2011 we repaid 945 million tenyear 660 us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 

in may 2011 we issued 400 million of sevenyear 325 fixed rate us dollar notes using the proceeds of 397 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper during 2011 the company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 400 million which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity the effective interest rate on these notes reflecting issuance discount and interest rate swaps was 231 in december 2011 

in november 2011 we issued 500 million of fiveyear 1875 fixed rate u s dollar notes using the proceeds of 498 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper the effective interest rate on these notes reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement was 198 in december 2011 

in december 2010 we issued 10 billion of tenyear 40 fixed rate us dollar notes using a portion of the 987 million net proceeds to make incremental pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions the proceeds were also used to retire commercial paper the effective interest rate on these notes reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement was 342 in december 2011 

  

in november 2009 we issued 500 million of tenyear 415 fixed rate us dollar notes and used proceeds of 496 million to retire a portion of our 66 us dollar notes due 2011 we retired 482 million of the 2011 debt which had an effective interest rate of 708 through a tender offer in connection with the debt retirement we recognized 35 million of interest expense and an acceleration of 3 million loss on an interest rate swap which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income these charges were included in 2009 cash flows from operating activities 

in may 2009 we issued 750 million of sevenyear 445 fixed rate us dollar notes and used proceeds of 745 million to pay down commercial paper in may 2009 we also entered into interest rate swaps on 1150 million of our debt interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 750 million effectively converted our 5125 us dollar notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the fiveyear term in addition interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 400 million effectively converted a portion of our 66 us dollar notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term 

in april 2010 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to 25 billion during 2010 through 2012 this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to 11 billion for 2010 and 650 million for 2009 

under these programs we repurchased approximately 15 million 21 million and 4 million shares of common stock for 793 million 11 billion and 187 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 167 per share in 2011 156 per share in 2010 and 143 per share in 2009 total cash paid for dividends increased by 34 in 2011 and 70 in 2010 

in march 2011 we entered into an unsecured fouryear credit agreement to replace our existing unsecured fiveyear credit agreement which would have expired in november 2011 the fouryear credit agreement allows us to borrow on a revolving credit basis up to 20 billion 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fouryear credit agreement which expires in march 2015 this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

we plan to use a combination of commercial paper and future issuances of term debt to refinance our 750 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter of 2012 

capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets continued to experience instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty throughout this period of uncertainty we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments generally represent less than 05 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately 40 of 2011 net sales therefore it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation 

  

that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at december 31 2011 we have property plant and equipment of 33 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 68 million of idle assets the largest individual idle asset is a facility outside the united states which we tested for impairment on a held and used basis the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net book value of the facility as of december 31 2011 management estimates the plant will be deployed within the next several years should management’s plan for deployment change this could result in an impairment charge of up to 46 million based on the carrying value as of december 31 2011 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process during the fourth quarter of 2011 we changed our reporting structure which altered the composition of the reporting units within the us morning foods and kashi operating segment the changes resulted in the reassignment of the assets and liabilities to the reporting units impacted the goodwill was allocated to the reporting units impacted using the relative fair value approach 

goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2011 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants 

these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at december 31 2011 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 51 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company within this total approximately 14 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company at december 31 2011 the fair value of our us snacks reporting unit exceeded its book value by 21 billion however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different weightedaverage cost of capital in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses additionally we have 57 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately 30 in both 2011 and 2010 if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation this could have resulted in an impairment loss for example if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by 200 basis points this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit management will continue to monitor the situation closely 

  

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 71 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2011 of 89 equated to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our 2011 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 29 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 31 2011 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2012 benefits expense by approximately 49 million correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2012 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 12 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2012 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 18 million in 2013 increasing to approximately 90 million in 2017 for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2011478 2010–208 2009–507 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 50 our initial trend rate for 2012 of 61 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 05 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 31 2011 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2012 benefits expense by approximately 17 million a 100 basis point excess of 2012 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 8 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years the net experience gain arising from recognition of 2011 claims experience and adoption of an employer group waiver plan egwp design for prescription drug costs was approximately 161 million 

  

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at december 31 2011 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2012 benefits expense by approximately 16 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of december 31 2011 we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 23 billion compared to approximately 17 billion at january 1 2011 of the total unamortized amounts at december 31 2011 approximately 19 billion was related to asset losses that occurred during 2008 and 2011 offset by 07 billion in asset gains during 2009 and 2010 with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and health care claims experience for 2012 we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately 34 million higher than the actual 2011 amount of approximately 142 million total employee benefit expense for 2012 is expected to be higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates phase in of the 2008 and 2011 investment losses offset by better than expected 2009 and 2010 investment performance 

during 2011 we made contributions in the amount of 180 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly discretionary additionally we contributed 12 million to our retiree medical programs 

assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2011 amount 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

presentation of comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard requiring most entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement—referred to as the statement of comprehensive income—or in two separate but consecutive statements of net income and other comprehensive income the update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income the new standard included a requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component on the face of the financial statements in december 2011 the reclassification requirement within the new standard was indefinitely deferred the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 and should be applied 

  

retrospectively early adoption is permitted we will adopt the new standard at the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year 

goodwill impairment testing 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an updated accounting standard allowing entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the updated standard an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the updated standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we will adopt the updated standard in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2012 

future outlook 

on february 15 2012 we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire procter  gamble’s pringles ® business for 2695 million which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately 2 billion of short and long term debt the transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2012 as such we expect having pringle’s included in our results for approximately six months 

we anticipate in 2012 we will continue to set the foundation for future growth as a result of price realization and mix improvement driven by innovation and supported by increased investment in brand building earnings per share on a currencyneutral basis is expected to grow by 2 to 4 percent prior to the impact of the pringles ® acquisition which is expected to be dilutive to 2012 earnings per share by 011 to 016 including onetime costs and changes to the share repurchase program 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2011 was 1265 million representing a settlement obligation of 7 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2010 was 1075 million representing a settlement obligation of 20 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 127 million at yearend 2011 and 108 million at yearend 2010 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings as of the end of our 2009 fiscal year we used the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars in may 2010 the venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market in june 2010 several large venezuelan commercial banks began operating the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme accordingly we began using the sitme rate as of january 1 2011 to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars during 2010 we recorded a 3 million foreign exchange gain in other income expense net associated with the translation of our subsidiary’s financials into us dollars with no impact during 2011 on a consolidated basis venezuela represents less than 2 of our business therefore any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 

  

primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2011 and 2009 we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes refer to disclosures contained in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2011 was 600 million representing a settlement receivable of 23 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2010 was 19 billion representing a settlement receivable of 74 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 18 million at yearend 2011 and 21 million at yearend 2010 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa cartonboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 104 million as of december 31 2011 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period at yearend january 1 2011 the notional amount was 125 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2011 including the north america natural gas swaps was 175 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 48 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2010 including the natural gas swaps was 379 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 16 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 12 million at yearend 2011 and 36 million at yearend 2010 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount as of december 31 2011 we had posted collateral of 2 million in the form of cash which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet there was no collateral balance requirement at january 1 2011 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company

securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans 

 

  

three plans are considered “equity compensation plans not approved by security holders” the kellogg share incentive plan which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most uk employees of specified kellogg company subsidiaries a similar plan which is available to employees in the republic of ireland and the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors which was adopted in 1986 and amended in 1993 and 2002 

under the kellogg share incentive plan eligible uk employees may contribute up to 1500 pounds sterling annually to the plan through payroll deductions the trustees of the plan use those contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market value on the open market with kellogg matching those contributions on a 11 basis shares must be withdrawn from the plan when employees cease employment under current law eligible employees generally receive certain income and other tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a specified number of years a similar plan is also available to employees in the republic of ireland as these plans are open market plans with no set overall maximum no amounts for these plans are included in the above table however approximately 68000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under the kellogg share incentive plan the plan for the republic of ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2011 with approximately an additional 68000 shares being provided as matched shares 

under the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors nonemployee directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation other than expense reimbursement into units which are credited to their accounts the units have a value equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the appropriate date with dividend equivalents being earned on the whole units in nonemployee directors’ accounts units may be paid in either cash or shares of our common stock either in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments with the payments to begin as soon as practicable after the nonemployee director’s service as a director terminates no more than 150000 shares are authorized for use under this plan of which approximately 11000 had been issued as of december 31 2011 because directors may elect and are likely to elect a distribution of cash rather than shares the contingently issuable shares are not included in column a of the table above

we consider that taken as a whole the rights under our various patents which expire from time to time are a valuable asset but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a valuable asset but are not believed to be material 

seasonality  demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays we also custombake cookies for the girl scouts of the usa which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year 

  

working capital  although terms vary around the world and by business types in the united states we generally have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2 10net 11 or 1 15net 16 receipts from goods sold supplemented as required by borrowings provide for our payment of dividends repurchases of our common stock capital expansion and for other operating expenses and working capital needs 

customers  our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2010 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 1 2011 approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 27 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2010 during 2010 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 46 of us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments 

backlog  for the most part orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders at january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 was not material to us 

competition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories both domestically and internationally our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products which are typically distributed at lower prices and generally with other food products principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions product quality taste convenience nutritional value price advertising and promotion 

research and development  research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research in battle creek michigan and at other locations around the world our expenditures for research and development were approximately 187 million in 2010 and 181 million in 2009 and 2008

environmental matters  our facilities are subject to various us and foreign federal state and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways we are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations we believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated misbranded or mislabeled we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time for example in june 

  

2010 we initiated a recall of certain readytoeat cereals due to an odor from waxy resins used to make package liner we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

changes in tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing labeling trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising labeling relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental food quality and safety or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our 

corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in 

  

response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions most of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in defending itself in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under environmental food quality and safety and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws in addition the company could incur substantial costs and fees in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against the company and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of january 1 2011 we had total debt of approximately 59 billion and total equity of 22 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of 

  

consolidated net sales during 2010 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 1 2011 approximately 18 of our consolidated receivables balance and 27 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2010 during 2010 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 46 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of january 1 2011 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 51 billion of which 36 billion was goodwill and 15 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 118 billion and total equity of 22 billion an impairment charge of 20 million was recognized in 2010 representing all of the goodwill from our 2008 acquisition of a business in china 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs furthermore a significant portion of the communications between our personnel customers and suppliers depends on information technology like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues we have technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate 

  

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

kellogg company and subsidiaries 

 

results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

kellogg company is the world’s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods including cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruitflavored snacks frozen waffles and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe latin america and asia pacific 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets these targets are 3 to 4 for internal net sales mid singledigit 4 to 6 for internal operating profit and high singledigit 7 to 9 for diluted net earnings per share eps on a currency neutral basis see the foreign currency translation section for a discussion and reconciliation of currency neutral eps a nongaap measure 

for our full year 2010 internal and reported net sales were down 1 consolidated internal operating profit was flat compared to the prior year reported operating profit decreased 1 diluted eps increased 6 on a currency neutral basis reported eps was 330 an increase of 4 over last year’s 316 

 

  

  

 while 2010 was a difficult year we have taken actions to regain momentum in 2011 we believe we can achieve our objectives through increased innovation and investments in brand building initiatives kellogg has over a 100 year heritage with strong brands in combination with an attractive dividend yield we believe our business model will provide a strong total return to our shareholders 

  

net sales and operating profit 

2010 compared to 2009 

the following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2010 versus 2009 

 

  

  

 our consolidated net sales were down 1 on both a reported and internal basis there were four major issues that affected our results first our categories respond to innovation and brand building we did not have sufficient cereal innovations in 2010 rather we focused on renovating our existing cereal products we invested in renovation to improve the nutritional profile of our products for 2011 we have a stronger innovation pipeline to drive topline growth secondly we experienced supply chain disruptions in our waffle business and had a second quarter recall of select packages of breakfast cereals as a result we have increased investment in our supply chain to mitigate potential risks next we experienced weakness in our core cereal businesses in both measured and nonmeasured channels lastly the competitive environment drove price deflation into the cereal category in late 2010 we announced price increases driven by higher input costs on many products across our categories around the world 

internal net sales for our north america operating segment declined 2 north america has three product groups retail cereal retail snacks and frozen and specialty channels retail cereal’s internal net sales declined by 5 on a fullyear basis our consumption was negatively impacted by the impact of the cereal recall that occurred in the second quarter of 2010 the brands involved in the recall were the cornerstone of our backtoschool promotions in the third quarter promotional pricing drove deflation into the category but did not drive higher category volumes as would be expected the us cereal category responds well to innovation while there were lower levels of innovation across the category in 2010 our innovations performed well we have also been impacted by less support from nonmeasured channels this year trade inventory levels at the end of 2009 were higher than normal as a result our 2010 sales were negatively impacted as retailers sold through their inventory reducing their purchases from us 

the retail snack product group cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars and fruitflavored snacks grew by 1 the modest growth was driven by poptarts ® and strong wholesome snack sales including our bar innovations such as fiberplus ® and special k fruit crisps ®  the strong performance in wholesome snacks was masked by weaker performance in cookies and to a lesser extent crackers we were able to maintain our cracker category share in measured channels despite increased competitive promotional activity consumption in the cookie category was down for the year our cookie performance was also impacted by the loss of shelf space in nonmeasured channels which we were able to regain during the fourth quarter of 2010 

internal net sales in the frozen and specialty channels frozen foods food service and vending decreased by 3 our sales were negatively impacted during the year due to the waffle supply disruption that began late in 2009 we have returned to full capacity and have introduced new innovations while the business rebounded slower than expected during 2010 as it took longer to rebuild and reset retailer shelves we have reinstated brand building and the business is responding positively our veggie business continues to perform well particularly morningstar farms ® burgers and entrees our food service business grew during the year continuing to outperform the industry 

our international operating segments’ internal net sales were flat compared to the prior year europe’s internal net sales declined 3 for the year the cereal category as measured by consumption declined in our core european countries such as the uk additionally we saw price deflation in many food categories across europe especially in the uk continued weakness in the russia snack business drove lower volumes and contributed to europe’s lower top line results we worked to stabilize the bulk business while introducing packaged snacks in russia latin america’s internal net sales growth was 5 the growth in cereal masked the decline in snacks our decline in snacks was largely driven by venezuela where we import some products from mexico the imports were impacted by exchange rate controls and it is no longer cost efficient to import goods internal 

  

net sales in asia pacific grew 2 driven by strong performance across most of asia as well as south africa this was muted by a decline in australia where the cereal category faced price deflation 

consolidated operating profit declined by 1 on an as reported basis and was flat on an internal basis when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by the cereal recall higher than expected commodity inflation and investments in our supply chain operating profit benefited from lower incentive compensation expense incentive compensation is based upon the company’s actual results compared to our target given results were lower than our targets which were set at the beginning of 2010 incentive compensation decreased significantly compared to the prior year despite 2010’s operating performance we recognized the need to invest in advertising accordingly we increased our spending in advertising by 4 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 

internal operating profit in north america decreased by 2 europe’s grew by 8 latin america’s declined by 2 and asia pacific’s declined by 30 north america’s decline was attributable to lower sales in our us cereal business competitive activity drove lower cereal sales as did the second quarter cereal recall these negative drivers were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and decreased spending on cost reduction initiatives europe’s operating profit increased due to lower commodity costs and less spending on cost reduction initiatives the decline in latin america’s operating profit is primarily a result of higher commodity costs asia pacific’s operating profit was negatively impacted by the impairment charges related to our business in china refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information corporate benefited from lower incentive compensation expense 

2009 compared to 2008 

the following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2009 versus 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

 our 2009 consolidated reported net sales were down compared to the prior year driven by a negative impact from foreign currency translation and an extra shipping week in 2008 excluding this negative impact internal net sales grew by 3 lapping 2008’s strong 5 growth while overall volume declined we achieved internal net sales growth driven by a particularly strong year in retail cereal and a solid year in retail snacks resulting from our pricing and mix there were several factors contributing to the volume decline in north america we experienced a supply disruption in our waffle plants in both russia and china we started moving our businesses away from lower margin products to higher margin branded products which resulted in a decline in volume during the year 

our north america operating segment had internal net sales growth of almost 3 against a difficult 6 comparative in 2008 we experienced growth in retail cereal of 4 and 3 growth in retail snacks which includes cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars and fruit snacks weakness in frozen and specialty 

  

channels which includes frozen foods food service and vending dampened net sales for the year with a decline in net sales of 1 

we experienced broad based growth in retail snacks with sales growth of 3 poptarts ® performed well as the category leader in north america toaster pastries a strong performance by cheezit ® as well as innovation drove growth in crackers cookies posted a slight gain for the year led by mother’s ® brand cookies our growth was negatively impacted by heavy competitor activity our best performing category within retail snacks was wholesome snacks the introduction of fiber plus ®  special k chocolaty pretzel ® and cinnabon ® bars drove growth in this category 

our frozen and specialty channels business was down 1 due to a few discrete issues our food service business is mostly noncommercial serving institutions such as schools hospitals and prisons this sector of the industry was not immediately impacted by the economic downturn that started in 2008 while we started to see recovery in 2009 it was slower than the commercial sectors such as hotels and restaurants we were also experiencing a supply disruption 

in our waffle facilities we made improvements in our facilities and worked with regulatory agencies a combination of extensive enhancements and repairs at our facilities and a flood at one facility significantly impacted production in the secondhalf of 2009 while our plants were operational at the end of 2009 they were not running at their previous level of capacity demand continued to exceed supply 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 3 on an internal basis europe’s internal net sales increased 2 yearoveryear europe was a tough environment for us during the year we encountered some retailer disputes earlier in 2009 that were resolved in the second half of the year helping us to achieve cereal volume growth latin america’s internal net sales growth was 7 attributable to both volume and price increases driven by retail cereal in mexico and venezuela internal net sales in asia pacific grew 5 driven by strong cereal performances in australia and india 

our consolidated operating profit increased by 10 on an internal basis and by 2 on a reported basis reported operating profit in each of our operating segments was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the absence of a 53 rd week in 2009 in 2009 we continued to experience cost pressures increased our spending on cost reduction initiatives and invested in advertising we were able to more than offset these increased costs by savings from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as pricing and mix during the fullyear of 2009 upfront costs were 138 million which were 63 million higher than the previous year upfront costs represent both exit or disposal activities as well as other cost reduction initiatives 

north america’s internal operating profit growth of 11 was driven by price and savings from our cost reduction initiatives which was partially offset by significantly higher upfront costs and increased advertising upfront costs reduced north america’s operating profit by 4 europe’s internal operating profit increased 7 benefiting from media deflation and operating efficiencies while absorbing higher upfront costs which reduced reported operating profit by 3 internal operating profit decreased 2 in latin america due to significantly higher material costs and increased advertising internal operating profit growth in asia pacific was 14 due to sales growth while reported operating profit was negatively impacted by the acquisition of navigable foods for further information on our acquisitions see note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

margin performance 

margin performance was as follows 

 

  

  

 as illustrated in the preceding table our consolidated gross margin declined by 20 basis points in 2010 due to the cereal recall increased cost pressures for fuel energy commodities and employee benefits and supply chain investments which were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and lower upfront costs recorded in cost of sales cogs our selling general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 40 basis points primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense and lower costs for cost reduction initiatives which more than offset increased advertising investment and a goodwill impairment 

our consolidated gross margin increased by 100 basis points in 2009 acquisitions lowered gross margin by approximately 10 basis points we experienced inflationary cost pressures for fuel energy commodities and employee benefits during 2009 higher costs including increased investment in upfront costs recorded in cogs were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and price increases our sga expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to higher costs for cost reduction initiatives of 17 million recorded in overhead as well as an increase in advertising spend 

  

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar and canadian dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future us dollar reported earnings as such we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis assuming earnings are translated at the prior year’s exchange rates this nongaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a useful measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 

below is a reconciliation of reported eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

  

  

 exit or disposal activities 

we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation 

we incurred costs that qualify as exit costs under us generally accepted accounting principles refer to note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail on our exit or disposal plans 

we include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability management announced its intention to achieve 1 billion of annual cost savings in three years the savings challenge began in 2009 with a goal of achieving 1 billion of savings by the end of 2011 these initiatives are integral to meeting our savings challenge 

other cost reduction initiatives 

2010 activities 

in addition to exit costs we incurred costs related to our cost reduction initiatives which do not qualify as exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these represent cash costs for consulting and other charges for our cogs and sga programs that are discussed in further detail in note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

costs incurred in fiscal year 2010 as well as total program costs are as follows 

 

 the additional cost and cash outlay in 2011 for these programs excluding exit costs is estimated to be 5 to 10 million 

sap reimplementation 

we are reimplementing sap which will result in process and productivity improvements the program is expected to require approximately 70 million of expense in addition to capital investments we are incurring incremental consulting costs associated with the reimplementation which will begin in 2011 

during 2010 we incurred approximately 9 million of cash consulting costs associated with the sap reimplementation the costs were recorded in sga expense within the north america operating segment for 8 million and the latin america operating segment for 1 million the additional cost and cash outlay in 2011 and 2012 for this program is estimated to be 60 million this program is not included in the table above 

  

prior year activities 

during 2009 we incurred 73 million of costs related to our ongoing cogs and sga programs these represent cash costs for consulting and other charges the costs by program and segment were as follows in millions 

 

 interest expense 

as illustrated in the following table annual interest expense for the 2008 to 2010 periods has trended downward the decline in 2010 was due primarily to costs incurred in 2009 for early redemption of longterm debt and lower interest rates on our longterm debt interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 20106 20094 200820 the decline for 2009 was primarily due to a drop in average interest rates we currently expect that our 2011 gross interest expense will be approximately 235 to 245 million 

 

  

 income taxes 

our reported effective tax rates for 2010 2009 and 2008 were 288 282 and 297 respectively the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings reduced our effective income tax rate by 3 percentage points for 2010 for 2009 and 2008 the impact was a reduction of 2 and 1 respectively refer to note 10 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information for 2011 we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 30 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates additionally the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 

product withdrawal 

refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 amounted to 1008 million a decrease of 635 million compared with 2009 the reduction in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and increased payments for advertising and promotion in 2010 our net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 amounted to 1643 million an increase of 376 million compared with 2008 reflecting lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and the impact of lower payments for advertising and promotion in 2009 

our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 23 days for 2010 23 days for 2009 and 22 days for 2008 during 2010 the impact of 

  

higher days of inventory outstanding was offset by an increase in days of trade payables outstanding days of inventory outstanding reflected the higher levels needed to improve order fill levels along with the impact of lower reported sales in 2010 core working capital in 2010 averaged 66 of net sales compared to 65 in the prior year the increase in 2009’s cash conversion cycle was the result of a decrease in days of trade payables outstanding which led to a 30 basis point increase in core working capital as an average of net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 

our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to 643 million 100 million and 451 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to 563 million 467 million net of tax we also made additional plan contributions amounting to 400 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 after adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed longterm rate of return of 89 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2017 or beyond our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2011 of approximately 200 million actual 2011 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 yearoveryear changes in cash flow as defined were driven by variations in the amount of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and changes in the level of capital expenditures during the threeyear period 

for 2011 we are expecting cash flow as defined to be 11 billion to 12 billion which reflects the impact of 2011 expected pension contributions net of tax 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2010 amounted to 465 million an increase of 95 million compared with 2009 due to a higher level of capital expenditures in 2010 

capital spending in 2010 included investments in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain in 2009 we spent capital for a new facility to manufacture readytoeat cereal in mexico and completed the expansion of the global research center located in battle creek michigan the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research the investment in our global research center which began in 2008 reflects our commitment to innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business in 2008 we also incurred construction costs to increase manufacturing capacity in europe 

net cash used in investing activities of 370 million in 2009 decreased by 311 million compared with 2008 reflecting a reduction in business acquisition activity and to a lesser extent lower capital spending during 2008 we used cash to expand our platform for future growth with acquisitions in russia china the us and australia acquisitions are discussed in note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to 38 in 2010 30 in 2009 and 36 in 2008 

we anticipate spending approximately 4 of net sales for additions to properties in 2011 in addition to continuing to invest in our supply chain and information technology infrastructure our spending will also focus on increasing capacity to facilitate growth and innovation 

  

financing activities 

our net cash used in financing activities for 2010 2009 and 2008 amounted to 439 million 1182 million and 780 million respectively 

total debt was 59 billion at yearend 2010 and 49 billion at yearend 2009 in december 2010 we issued 10 billion of tenyear 40 fixed rate us dollar notes using a portion of the 987 million net proceeds to make incremental pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions the proceeds were also used to retire commercial paper taking into consideration the impact of hedge settlements and the issuance discount the effective interest rate on the notes issued in december 2010 is 342 

in november 2009 we issued 500 million of tenyear 415 fixed rate us dollar notes and used proceeds of 496 million to retire a portion of our 66 us dollar notes due 2011 we retired 482 million of the 2011 debt which had an effective interest rate of 708 through a tender offer in connection with the debt retirement we recognized 35 million of interest expense and an acceleration of 3 million loss on an interest rate swap which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income these charges were included in 2009 cash flows from operating activities 

in may 2009 we issued 750 million of sevenyear 445 fixed rate us dollar notes and used proceeds of 745 million to pay down commercial paper in may 2009 we also entered into interest rate swaps on 1150 million of our debt interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 750 million effectively converted our 5125 us dollar notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the fiveyear term in addition interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 400 million effectively converted a portion of our 66 us dollar notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term 

in march 2008 we issued 750 million of fiveyear 425 fixed rate us dollar notes under an existing shelf registration statement we used proceeds of 746 million from issuance of this longterm debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper in conjunction with this debt issuance we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 750 million which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the fiveyear term in 2008 we had cash outflows of 465 million in connection with the repayment of fiveyear us dollar notes at maturity in june 2008 that debt had an effective interest rate of 335 

we repurchased approximately 21 million shares of our common stock in 2010 for 11 billion under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in april 2010 this program authorized repurchases of our common stock amounting to 25 billion during 2010 through 2012 this three year authorization replaced a previous share buyback program which had authorized stock repurchases of up to 11 billion for 2010 

during 2011 and 2012 we plan to execute the remaining repurchases under the 2010 authorization with projected purchases of 800 million in 2011 and the balance in 2012 we expect 2011 average shares outstanding to decline by 4 percent compared with 2010 actual repurchases could be different from our current projections as influenced by factors such as changes in our stock price and other competing priorities 

during 2009 we spent 187 million to repurchase 4 million of our shares while in 2008 we spent 650 million to repurchase 13 million shares our board of directors had authorized annual stock repurchases of up to 650 million for 2009 and 2008 in addition a separate 500 million share repurchase authorization received board approval in 2008 we made no repurchases under this authorization which was later terminated because we decided to use cash to fund pension and postretirement benefit plans and reduce commercial paper 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 156 per share in 2010 143 per share in 2009 and 130 per share in 2008 total cash paid for dividends increased by 70 in 2010 and 103 in 2009 our objective is to maintain our dividend payout ratio between 40 and 50 of reported net earnings 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in november 2011 under this facility we can borrow up to 20 billion on a revolving credit basis this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it we are in the process of entering into a new credit agreement that will replace the existing agreement 

we plan to use commercial paper to refinance our 946 million of debt maturing in the first quarter of 2011 

  

during the third quarter of 2008 and thereafter capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets experienced increased instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty throughout this period of uncertainty we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 we did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 1 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately 40 of 2010 net sales therefore it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

property 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable management evaluates several conditions including but not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used including an extended period of idleness and a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for assets to be held and used we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the longlived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 

at january 1 2011 we have property plant and equipment of 31 billion net of accumulated depreciation on our balance sheet included in this amount are approximately 70 million of idle assets the largest individual idle asset is a facility outside the united states which we tested for impairment on a held and used basis the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net book value of the facility as of january 1 2011 management estimates the plant will be deployed within the next several years should management’s plan for deployment change this could result in an impairment charge of up to 50 million based on the current carrying value 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2010 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at january 1 2011 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 51 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company within this 

  

total approximately 14 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company at january 1 2011 the fair value of our north america snacks reporting unit was almost twice its book value however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different weightedaverage cost of capital in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses additionally we have 62 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit declined in 2010 from an excess of 100 to an excess of 30 the yearoveryear decline was attributable to lower margins resulting from our strategy to stabilize the bulk snack business while introducing packaged snacks as well as reintroducing cereal into the market if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda in the valuation this could have resulted in an impairment loss for example if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by 200 basis points this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit management will continue to monitor the situation closely 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 69 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2010 of 89 equated to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our 2010 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 31 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 1 2011 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2011 benefits expense by approximately 50 million correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2011 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 13 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2011 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 17 million in 2012 increasing to approximately 85 million in 2016 for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2010208 2009–507 2008–1528 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 

  

our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 08 our initial trend rate for 2011 of 66 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 05 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at january 1 2011 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2011 benefits expense by approximately 19 million a 100 basis point excess of 2011 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 9 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years the net experience gain arising from recognition of 2010 claims experience was approximately 36 million 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount based on a cashflow matching analysis using towers watson’s proprietary ratelink tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans prior to 2010 we employed a similar methodology but used the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index there was no material difference in the discount rate resulting from the change ratelink establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of us high quality bonds a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at january 1 2011 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2011 benefits expense by approximately 15 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of january 1 2011 we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 17 billion similar to approximately 17 billion at january 2 2010 of the total unamortized amounts at january 1 2011 approximately 14 billion was related to asset losses that occurred during 2008 offset by 07 billion in asset gains during 2009 and 2010 with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate prior to 2010 for 2011 we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately 27 million higher than the actual 2010 amount of approximately 113 million total employee benefit expense for 2011 is expected to be higher than 2010 due to lower discount rates a further phase in of the 2008 investment losses offset by better than expected 2009 and 2010 investment performance based on our current actuarial assumptions we expect 2012 pension expense to increase primarily due to further phasein of 2008 investment losses 

during 2010 we made contributions in the amount of 350 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly discretionary additionally we contributed 293 million to our retiree medical programs most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits 

assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2010 amount 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 

we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when in our judgment it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to 

  

have a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances such as the progress of tax audits new or emerging legislation and tax planning the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 10 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

in december 2010 the financial accounting standards board issued a new accounting standard related to application of the goodwill impairment model when a reporting unit has a carrying amount that is zero or a negative value the new standard clarifies that when this is the case a goodwill impairment test should be performed if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists we will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2011 we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

future outlook 

we have taken actions to regain momentum in 2011 through increased innovation and by investing in our brands and our supply chain we have strong innovations and expect improved trends in our core categories we expect our internal net sales will grow by 3 to 4 percent internal operating profit is expected to be flat to down 2 percent resulting from the increase in cost pressures as well as a comparison issue related to incentive compensation which was significantly lower in 2010 due to our results earnings per share on a currencyneutral basis is expected to grow low singledigits gross profit margin is expected to be down slightly for the year gross interest expense is expected to be 235 to 245 million we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30 lastly we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2011’s cash flow to be between 11 and 12 billion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to thirdparty purchases intercompany transactions and when applicable nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2010 was 1075 million representing a settlement obligation of 20 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2009 was 1588 million representing a settlement obligation of 24 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 108 million at yearend 2010 and 159 million at yearend 2009 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year 

  

gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings as of the end of our 2009 fiscal year we used the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars in may 2010 the venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market in june 2010 several large venezuelan commercial banks began operating the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme we intend to use sitme to settle us dollar denominated assets and liabilities accordingly we are using the sitme rate at january 1 2011 to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars during the second quarter of 2010 we recorded an 8 million foreign exchange gain in other income expense net associated with the translation of our subsidiary’s financials into us dollars with the net impact for full year 2010 amounting to a 3 million gain on a consolidated basis venezuela represents only 1 to 2 of our business therefore any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2009 and 2008 we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes refer to disclosures contained in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2010 was 1900 million representing a settlement receivable of 74 million the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at yearend 2009 was 1900 million representing a settlement receivable of 43 million assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 21 million at yearend 2010 and 22 million at yearend 2009 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa paperboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 125 million as of january 1 2011 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period at yearend january 2 2010 the notional amount was 146 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2010 including the north america natural gas swaps was 379 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 16 million the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2009 including the natural gas swaps was 213 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 16 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 36 million at yearend 2010 and 18 million at yearend 2009 generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount there were no collateral balance requirements at january 1 2011 or january 2 2010 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company

securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans 

 

  

three plans are considered “equity compensation plans not approved by security holders” the kellogg share incentive plan which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most uk employees of specified kellogg company subsidiaries a similar plan which is available to employees in the republic of ireland and the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors which was adopted in 1986 and amended in 1993 and 2002 

under the kellogg share incentive plan eligible uk employees may contribute up to 1500 pounds sterling annually to the plan through payroll deductions the trustees of the plan use those contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market value on the open market with kellogg matching those contributions on a 11 basis shares must be withdrawn from the plan when employees cease employment under current law eligible employees generally receive certain income and other tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a specified number of years a similar plan is also available to employees in the republic of ireland as these plans are open market plans with no set overall maximum no amounts for these plans are included in the above table however approximately 66000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under the kellogg share incentive plan the plan for the republic of ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2010 with approximately an additional 66000 shares being provided as matched shares 

under the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors nonemployee directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation other than expense reimbursement into units which are credited to their accounts the units have a value equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the appropriate date with dividend equivalents being earned on the whole units in nonemployee directors’ accounts units may be paid in either cash or shares of our common stock either in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments with the payments to begin as soon as practicable after the nonemployee director’s service as a director terminates no more than 150000 shares are authorized for use under this plan of which approximately 11000 had been issued as of january 1 2011 because directors may elect and are likely to elect a distribution of cash rather than shares the contingently issuable shares are not included in column a of the table above

we consider that taken as a whole the rights under our various patents which expire from time to time are a valuable asset but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a valuable asset but are not believed to be material 

seasonality demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays we also custombake cookies for the girl scouts of the usa which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year 

  

working capital although terms vary around the world and by business types in the united states we generally have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2 10net 11 or 1 15net 16 receipts from goods sold supplemented as required by borrowings provide for our payment of dividends repurchases of our common stock capital expansion and for other operating expenses and working capital needs 

customers our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2009 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 2 2010 approximately 17 of our consolidated receivables balance and 26 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2009 during 2009 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 44 of us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments 

backlog for the most part orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders at january 2 2010 and january 3 2009 was not material to us 

competition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories both domestically and internationally our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products which are typically distributed at lower prices and generally with other food products principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions product quality taste convenience nutritional value price advertising and promotion 

research and development research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research in battle creek michigan and at other locations around the world our expenditures for research and development were approximately 181 million in 2009 and 2008 and 179 million in 2007

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions climate change or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating results 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar venezuelan bolivar fuerte russian ruble and mexican peso because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently changes in the value of the us dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food 

  

products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

if our food products become adulterated or misbranded we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of 

time for example in january 2009 we initiated a recall of certain austin and keebler branded peanut butter sandwich crackers and certain famous amos and keebler branded peanut butter cookies as a result of potential contamination of ingredients at a supplier’s facility the recall was expanded in late january and february to include bear naked  kashi and special k products impacted by that same supplier’s ingredients the costs of the recall negatively impacted gross margin and operating profit in fiscal 2008 and 2009 we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

changes in tax environmental food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing trade food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union international accords and treaties and others including voluntary regulation by other bodies 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that is becoming increasingly burdensome those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental food quality and safety or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divesture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our 

  

corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business 

there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in defending itself in civil criminal or regulatory actions including under environmental food quality and safety and environmental laws and regulations or in asserting its rights under various laws in addition the company could incur substantial costs and fees in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against the company and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of january 2 2010 we had total debt of approximately 49 billion and total equity of 23 billion 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession financial and credit market disruptions or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations our results in the 

  

past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 21 of consolidated net sales during 2009 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 2 2010 approximately 17 of our consolidated receivables balance and 26 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2009 during 2009 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 34 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 44 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of january 2 2010 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 51 billion of which 36 billion was goodwill and 15 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 112 billion and total equity of 23 billion 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material affect on our market share and our profitability 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and 

  

distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs furthermore a significant portion of the communications between our personnel customers and suppliers depends on information technology like other companies our information technology systems 

may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues we have technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products

results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

kellogg company is the world’s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods including cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks frozen waffles and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe latin america and asia pacific 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets these targets are low singledigit 1 to 3 for internal net sales mid singledigit 4 to 6 for internal operating profit and high singledigit 7 to 9 for diluted net earnings per share eps on a currency neutral basis see foreign currency translation section for our definition of currency neutral eps 

for our full year 2009 we were at the high end of our longterm annual net sales target with internal growth of 3 on a reported basis net sales declined by 2 consolidated internal operating profit increased 10 exceeding our longterm annual growth target reported operating profit grew 2 diluted eps grew 13 on a currency neutral basis exceeding our longterm annual growth target of 7 to 9 reported eps was 316 an increase of 6 over last year’s 299 

  

  

  

 in combination with an attractive dividend yield we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders we believe we can achieve this sustainable growth through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business expanding our snacks business and pursuing selected growth opportunities we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profitrich sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital we believe our steady earnings growth strong cash flow and continued investment during a multiyear period of economic uncertainty demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model 

  

net sales and operating profit 

2009 compared to 2008 

the following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2009 versus 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

 our consolidated reported net sales were down compared to last year driven by a negative impact from foreign currency translation and an extra shipping week in 2008 excluding this negative impact internal net sales grew by 3 lapping last year’s strong 5 growth while our overall volume declined we achieved internal sales growth driven by a particularly strong year in retail cereal and a solid year in retail snacks resulting from our pricing and mix there were several factors contributing to the volume decline in north america we experienced a supply disruption in our waffle plants in both russia and china we are moving our businesses away from lower margin products and going to higher margin branded products which resulted in a decline in volume during the year 

our north america operating segment had internal net sales growth of almost 3 against a difficult 6 comparative in the year ago period we experienced growth in retail cereal of 4 and 3 growth in retail snacks which includes cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars and fruit snacks weakness in frozen and specialty channels which includes frozen foods food service and vending dampened net sales for the year with a decline in net sales of 1 

  

cereal continues to be a strong category where we achieved volume growth during the year it responds well to innovation and advertising we are committed to providing nutritious food to our consumers and introduced froot loops ® and apple jacks ® with fiber in august of 2009 our business is focused on driving our top 8 brands as well as kashi ® cereals 

we experienced broad based growth in retail snacks with sales growth of 3 poptarts ® continues to perform well and is the category leader in north america toaster pastries a strong performance by cheezit ®  as well as innovation drove growth in crackers cookies posted a slight gain for the year led by our recently acquired mother’s ® brand cookies our growth was negatively impacted by heavy competitor activity our best performing category within retail snacks was wholesome snacks the introduction of fiber plus ®  special k ® chocolaty pretzel and cinnabon ® bars drove growth in this category 

our frozen and specialty channels business was down 1 experiencing a tough year due to a few discrete issues our food service business is mostly noncommercial serving institutions such as schools hospitals and prisons this sector of the industry was not immediately impacted by the economic downturn that started in 2008 while we are seeing a recovery we believe it will be slower than the commercial sectors such and hotels and restaurants continuing to impact us until mid2010 we have also been experiencing a supply disruption in our waffle facilities we have been making improvements in our facilities and are working with regulatory agencies a combination of extensive enhancements and repairs at our facilities and a flood at one facility significantly impacted production in the secondhalf of the year while our plants are operational they are not running at their previous level of capacity demand continues to exceed supply we are exploring ways to increase capacity including investing additional capital but expect this situation will impact our net sales in 2010 this impact is included in our 2010 guidance 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 3 on an internal basis europe’s internal net sales increased 2 yearoveryear europe was a tough environment for us in 2009 we encountered some retailer disputes earlier in the year that were resolved in the second half of the year helping us to achieve cereal volume growth latin america’s internal net sales growth was 7 attributable to both volume and price increases driven by retail cereal in mexico and venezuela internal net sales in asia pacific grew 5 driven by strong cereal performances in australia and india 

our consolidated operating profit was strong increasing by 10 on an internal basis and by 2 on a reported basis reported operating profit in each of our operating segments was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the absence of a 53 rd week in 2009 in 2009 we continued to experience cost 

  

pressures increased our spending on upfront costs and invested in advertising we were able to more than offset these increased costs by savings from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as pricing and mix during the fullyear of 2009 our upfront costs were 138 million which were 63 million higher than the previous year upfront costs represent both exit or disposal activities as well as other cost reduction initiatives 

north america’s internal operating profit growth of 11 was driven by price and savings from our cost reduction initiatives which was partially offset by significantly higher upfront costs and increased advertising upfront costs reduced north america’s operating profit by 4 europe’s internal operating profit increased 7 benefiting from media deflation and operating efficiencies while absorbing higher upfront costs which reduced operating profit by 3 internal operating profit decreased 2 in latin america due to significantly higher material costs and increased advertising internal operating profit growth in asia pacific was 14 due to sales growth while reported operating profit was negatively impacted by the acquisition of navigable foods for further information on our acquisitions see note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

2008 compared to 2007 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2008 versus 2007 

 

  

  

  

  

   

during 2008 our consolidated reported net sales increased almost 9 driven by our north america business with increases in both volume and pricemix for the year internal net sales grew over 5 building on a 5 rate of internal growth during 2007 we had a fiftythird week in our 2008 fiscal year which contributed almost 2 to our reported growth over the prior year as did our acquisitions management has estimated the pro forma effect on the company’s results of operations as though these business combinations had been completed at the beginning of either 2008 or 2007 would have been immaterial successful innovation brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion investment as well as our price increases continued to drive growth declines in volume in both europe and latin america were more than offset by growth in pricingmix due to our price increases asia pacific had a particularly strong year experiencing growth of 8 driven by cereal sales across the operating segment 

for 2008 our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of almost 9 with internal net sales growth of 6 the growth was broad based and driven by our price realization and strong innovation the major product brands grew as follows retail cereal 3 retail snacks cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars and fruit snacks 6 frozen and specialty channels frozen foods food service and vending 9 while retail cereal grew 3 for the year we had a relatively soft share performance in the fourth quarter facing aggressive pricebased incentives from our competitors in addition while we estimate our consumption was up 2 across all channels reductions in trade inventory also adversely affected shipments as a result our fourth quarter internal net sales declined by 3 which was up against a tough comparable of 8 growth in the prior year our snacks business grew 6 in 2008 on top of 7 growth last year our growth came from volume price increases and successful innovations such as townhouse flipsides and cheezit duoz  we saw net sales growth in all product categories — toaster pastries crackers cookies and wholesome snacks our “right bites” 100 calorie cookie and cracker packs performed well as we saw an increase in demand for portion controlled portable food our frozen and specialty channels business grew over 9 our food service business performed well achieving mid singledigit growth for the year frozen realized strong sales driven by innovations such as bake shop swirlz  mini muffin tops and french toast waffles  

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 9 or 5 on an internal basis europe’s internal net sales grew by almost 4 attributable to pricemix as volume was down slightly the uk and continental europe have been impacted by the economic crisis which had consumers searching for value and retailers reducing inventory snacks products performed well across the 

  

region especially in the uk driven by rice krispies squares  latin america’s internal net sales growth was 4 attributable to our price increases and driven by cereal sales in mexico and venezuela the growth in 2008 was on top of 2007 growth of 9 volume was down for 2008 due to the economic environment which impacted consumer confidence asia pacific had a very strong year with 8 internal net sales growth the growth was volume driven and broad based in both retail cereal and retail snacks 

consolidated operating profit in 2008 grew by almost 5 on an as reported basis and 4 on an internal basis operating profit in all areas was impacted by cost pressures as discussed in more detail in the margin performance section below north america grew by 6 driven by growth in net sales and lower exit costs which offset higher commodity costs costs associated with the peanutrelated recall of kellogg products adversely impacted north america’s operating profit by 34 million or 2 of the full year operating profit see the voluntary product withdrawal section for more details operating profit declined slightly in both europe and latin america due to increased commodity costs and cost reduction initiatives asia pacific’s operating profit increased 11 on an internal basis due to strong top line growth on a consolidated basis operating profit from acquisitions decreased internal operating profit by 1 in line with our expectations with europe and asia pacific being particularly impacted by our russian and chinese acquisitions respectively 

margin performance 

margin performance was as follows 

 

  

  

 we strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brandbuilding and innovation expenditures we maximize our gross profit dollars by managing external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements implementing productivity savings and technological initiatives as well as entering into commodity hedges and fixed price contracts to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging for full year 2009 our gross profit was up 24 million despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of 213 million and 46 million of higher upfront costs in cost of goods sold cogs 

  

as illustrated in the preceding table our consolidated gross margin increased by 100 basis points in 2009 our acquisitions lowered gross margin by approximately 10 basis points although moderating we also continue to experience inflationary cost pressures for fuel energy commodities and employee benefits during the year higher costs including increased investment in upfront costs recorded in cogs were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and price increases our selling general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to higher upfront costs of 17 million recorded in overhead as well as an increase in advertising spend 

our decline in gross margin for 2008 reflected the impact of significant cost pressure with higher costs for commodities energy and fuel being partially offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives and increased pricing for 2008 these cost pressures represented 10 of 2007’s cogs primarily associated with our ingredient purchases in 2008 acquisitions negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points for 2008 our sga decreased over the prior year due to our strong net sales growth lower expense related to cost reduction initiatives recorded in sga expense continued discipline in overhead spending and efficiencies in advertising and promotion 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar and canadian dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

due to potential volatility in the foreign exchange markets we measure eps growth and provide guidance on a currency neutral basis assuming earnings are translated at the prior year’s exchange rates this nongaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a better measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 

  

below is a reconciliation of reported eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

  

 exit or disposal activities 

we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal plans for which material charges will be incurred we include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability management announced its intention to achieve 1 billion of annual cost savings in three years beginning in 2012 these initiatives are integral to meeting our 1 billion savings challenge 

refer to note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our exit or disposal activities 

other cost reduction initiatives 

2009 activities 

we incurred costs related to our cost reduction initiatives which do not qualify as exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states these represent cash costs for consulting and other charges for our cogs and sga programs 

costs incurred in fiscal year 2009 as well as total program costs are as follows in millions 

 

 the additional cost and cash outlay in 2010 for these programs excluding exit costs is estimated to be 30 to 35 million 

  

prior year activities 

during 2008 we incurred 17 million of expense related to the elimination of the accelerated ownership feature of certain employee stock options refer to note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements this expense was recorded in sga expense within corporate operating profit 

we also incurred 10 million of expense during 2008 in connection with a payment for the restructuring of our labor force at a manufacturing facility in mexico the cost which was recorded in cogs and was attributable to the latin america operating segment resulted in employee benefit cost savings 

interest expense 

as illustrated in the following table annual interest expense for the 20072009 periods has trended down slightly the decline in 2009 was due primarily to lower commercial paper balances during the year the impact of our fixedtovariable interest rate swaps on our longterm debt and lower commercial paper interest rates partially offset by the costs of early redemption of longterm debt and interest on longterm debt issued in 2009 interest income recorded in other income expense net was in millions 20094 200820 200723 the decline for 2009 was primarily due to a drop in average interest rates we currently expect that our 2010 gross interest expense will be approximately 250 to 260 million 

 

  

 other income expense net 

refer to note 15 within to notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

our longterm objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 30 in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009 was 30 for 2008 and 2007 it was 31 and 32 respectively we currently expect our 2010 sustainable rate to be approximately 31 our reported rates of 282 for 2009 297 for 2008 and 287 for 2007 were lower than the sustainable 

  

rates for those years due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes refer to note 10 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information for 2010 we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 30 to 31 this could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also impact the effective tax rate as it is dependent upon the us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates 

voluntary product withdrawal 

refer to note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that volatility andor disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 23 days for 2009 22 days for 2008 and 24 days for 2007 the increase in 2009 was the result of a decrease in days of trade payables outstanding while the decrease in 2008 was the result of a decrease in days of inventory outstanding 

  

the following table presents the major components of our operating cash flow 

 

  

 our net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was 376 million higher than in 2008 due primarily to positive cash flows associated with other working capital and lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions partially offset by the impact of changes in core working capital and deferred income taxes in 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was 236 million lower than 2007 due primarily to the increase in pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2008 and an unfavorable yearoveryear variance in other working capital partially offsetting the decrease in 2008 operating cash flows was the impact of changes in deferred income taxes and a favorable variance in core working capital 

in 2009 core working capital was an average of 65 of net sales an increase of 03 compared with 2008 in 2008 core working capital was an average of 62 of net sales an improvement of 06 compared with 2007 we manage core working capital through timely collection of accounts receivable extending terms on accounts payable and careful monitoring of inventory 

in 2009 the favorable yearoveryear variance in other working capital was largely attributable to income taxes and advertising and promotion other working capital in 2008 reflected an increase in cash paid associated with hedging programs cash paid for advertising and promotion and the impact of changes in accrued salaries and wages 

our total pension and postretirement plan funding amounted to 100 million 451 million and 96 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2008 adverse conditions in the equity markets caused 

  

the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed longterm rate of return of 89 as a result we decided to make additional contributions to our pension and postretirement plans amounting to 400 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 

the pension protection act ppa and subsequent regulations determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2013 our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance future discount rates based on average yields of high grade corporate bonds and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign plan contributions in 2010 of approximately 50 million actual 2010 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 changes in cash flow as defined for 2009 and 2008 were primarily attributable to the additional 400 million in pension contributions we made in the fourth quarter of 2008 and lower capital expenditures 2009 

for 2010 we are expecting cash flow as defined to be comparable to 2009 we expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth and continued prudent management of our working capital 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2009 amounted to 370 million a decrease of 311 million compared with 2008 net cash used in investing activities of 681 million in 2008 increased by 80 million compared with 2007 

the reduction in cash used in investing activities in 2009 was attributable mainly to the reduction in business acquisition activity in 2009 and to a lesser extent it also reflected lower capital spending during 2008 we used cash to expand our platform for future growth with acquisitions in russia china the us and australia during 2007 we completed two business acquisitions in order to support the continued growth of our north america operating segment acquisitions are discussed in note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to 30 in 2009 36 in 2008 and 40 in 2007 

in 2009 we spent capital for a new facility to manufacture readytoeat cereal in mexico and completed the expansion of the global research center located in battle creek michigan the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research the investment in our global research center which began in 2008 reflects our commitment to innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business in 2008 we also incurred construction costs to increase manufacturing capacity in europe in 2007 we also increased capacity including the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in chicago illinois 

we continue to expect our kellogg’s lean efficient and agile network k lean manufacturing efficiency initiative to result in a trend toward lower capital spending going forward our longterm target for capital spending is between 30 and 40 of net sales our 2010 capital plan projects spending of 500 million which is at the high end of our 30 to 40 range this is driven by a significant investment in our information technology infrastructure as we reinstall and upgrade our sap platform we also have plans to expand our manufacturing capacity in 2010 primarily for eggo ® waffles in the us 

financing activities 

our net cash used in financing activities for 2009 2008 and 2007 amounted to 1182 million 780 million and 788 million respectively 

total debt was 49 billion at yearend 2009 and 55 billion at yearend 2008 the reduction in total debt primarily commercial paper resulted from purchasing fewer shares of our stock in 2009 compared to 2008 

in november 2009 we issued 500 million of tenyear 415 fixed rate us dollar notes and used proceeds of 496 million to retire a portion of our 66 us dollar notes due 2011 we retired 482 million 

  

of the 2011 debt through a tender offer which resulted in 35 million of interest expense and an acceleration of 3 million loss on an interest rate swap which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income these charges were included in cash flows from operating activities this debt had an effective interest rate of 708 in may 2009 we issued 750 million of sevenyear 445 fixed rate us dollar notes and used proceeds of 745 million to pay down commercial paper in may 2009 we also entered into interest rate swaps on 1150 million of our debt interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 750 million effectively converted our 5125 us dollar notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the fiveyear term in addition interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 400 million effectively converted a portion of our 66 us dollar notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term 

in march 2008 we issued 750 million of fiveyear 425 fixed rate us dollar notes under an existing shelf registration statement we used proceeds of 746 million from issuance of this longterm debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper in conjunction with this debt issuance we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 750 million which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the fiveyear term in 2008 we had cash outflows of 465 million in connection with the repayment of fiveyear us dollar notes at maturity in june 2008 that debt had an effective interest rate of 335 

in february 2007 we redeemed euro notes for 728 million to partially finance this redemption we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies in december 2007 the company issued 750 million of fiveyear 5125 fixed rate us dollar notes under the existing shelf registration statement using the proceeds to replace a portion of our us commercial paper 

our board of directors authorized stock repurchases of up to 650 million for 2009 during 2009 we spent 187 million to purchase approximately 4 million shares of common stock the unused portion of the 2009 authorization amounting to 463 million was rolled over and is available to be executed against in 2010 the board of directors has authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to 650 million bringing the total 2010 stock repurchase authorization to 1113 million during 2008 and 2007 we repurchased 650 million of our common stock each year under programs authorized by our board of directors the number of shares repurchased amounted to approximately 13 million and 12 million shares respectively in 2008 and 2007 a separate 500 million share repurchase authorization received board approval in third quarter 2008 we made no share repurchases under this authorization because we decided to use cash to fund pension plans and reduce commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2008 the 500 million share repurchase authorization was later canceled 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 143 per share in 2009 130 per share in 2008 and 1202 per share in 2007 total cash paid for dividends increased by 103 in 2009 and 42 in 2008 our objective is to maintain our dividend payout ratio between 40 and 50 of reported net earnings 

our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in 2011 under which we can borrow up to 20 billion on a revolving credit basis this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

during the third quarter of 2008 and thereafter capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets experienced increased instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty throughout this period of uncertainty we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected by the changes in the credit environment and the amount of our total debt outstanding remained relatively flat over the past three years 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis

critical accounting estimates 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately 40 of 2009 net sales therefore it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units for the 2009 goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples our 

  

approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 

similarly impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

we also evaluate the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

at january 2 2010 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 51 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company within this total approximately 14 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company at january 2 2010 the fair value of our north america snacks reporting unit was almost twice its book value however if we had used materially different assumptions which we do not believe are reasonably possible regarding the future performance of our business or a different weightedaverage cost of capital in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses andor amortization expense 

  

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees’ active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 68 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2009 of 89 equated to approximately the 58th percentile expectation of our 2009 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 32 of our global benefit plan assets 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 2 2010 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2010 benefits expense by approximately 40 million 

  

correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2010 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 12 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2010 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 14 million in 2011 increasing to approximately 7 million in 2015 for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2009507 2008–1528 2007–99 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 24 our initial trend rate for 2010 of 71 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 05 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at january 2 2010 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2010 benefits expense by approximately 17 million a 100 basis point excess of 2010 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 9 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years the net experience gain arising from recognition of 2009 claims experience was approximately 16 million 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we selected the discount rate using the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index published monthly by citigroup using this methodology we determined the single discount rate for each of our retirement plans that was equivalent to discounting against the entire citigroup spot yield curve the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

based on consolidated obligations at january 2 2010 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2010 benefits expense by approximately 14 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of january 2 2010 we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 17 billion as compared to approximately 19 billion at january 3 2009 the yearoveryear decrease in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to favorable asset performance during 2009 of the total unamortized amounts at january 2 2010 approximately 15 billion was related to asset losses that occurred during 2008 offset by 05 billion in asset gains during 2009 with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate prior to 2009 for 2010 we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately 37 million higher than the actual 2009 amount of approximately 73 million total employee benefit expense for 2010 is expected to be higher than 2009 due to lower discount rates a further phase in of the 2008 investment losses offset by better than expected 2009 investment performance based on our current actuarial assumptions we expect 2011 pension expense to increase significantly primarily due to the amortization of net experience losses 

during 2009 we made contributions in the amount of 87 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly discretionary we anticipate making additional contributions in future years due to the poor performance of global equity markets during 2008 additionally we contributed 13 million to our retiree medical programs most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits 

assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience 

  

losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2009 amount 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense we establish tax reserves associated with uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances 

the company evaluates uncertain tax positions in two steps the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythan not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position in weighing the technical merits of the position we consider the facts and circumstances of the position we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythan not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements while reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes the company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer morelikelythan not of being sustained 

for the periods presented our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately 130 million reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1 of earnings before income taxes annually significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 10 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

the current portion of our tax reserves and related interest reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other current liabilities and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other liabilities 

 

accounting standards to be adopted in future periods 

variable interest entities 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities vies this guidance requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether a company 1 has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie this standard is effective at the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year and must be applied retrospectively the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 

 

future outlook 

despite a tough economy in 2009 we met or exceeded all of our longterm annual targets we are poised to continue this momentum in 2010 we expect our business model and strategy will deliver internal net sales growth of 2 to 3 in line with our longterm annual targets of low singledigits 1 to 3 internal operating profit is expected to grow 8 to 10 above our longterm annual target of mid singledigits 4 to 6 we expect this growth to result from savings from our upfront cost programs as well as lower spending on upfront costs we expect our earnings per share to grow 11 to 13 above our longterm annual target of high singledigit 7 to 9 growth on a currency neutral basis gross profit margin percentage is expected to expand by approximately 100 basis points as our savings from cost reduction initiatives will more than offset pressure on cost of goods sold gross interest expense for 2010 is expected to decline to approximately 250 to 260 million our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 30 to 31 we continue to remain committed to investing in brand building costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities lastly we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2010 cash flow to be similar to 2009’s result of 1266 million after capital expenditures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to thirdparty purchases intercompany loans and product shipments our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to 

  

volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2009 was 1588 million representing a settlement obligation of 24 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2008 was 924 million representing a settlement receivable of 22 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 159 million at yearend 2009 and the settlement receivable would have decreased by 92 million at yearend 2008 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

with regard to our foreign currency exchange risk we continue to monitor the highly volatile economic environment in venezuela on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government instituted a two tier official exchange rate system which was effective as of january 11 2010 this resulted in a devaluation of the official rate that had previously been at 215 bolivars per 1 a preferential rate for essential items such as medical food and heavy machinery was established at 26 bolivars per 1 referred to as the “preferential rate” all other imports will be imported at 43 bolivars per 1 referred to as the “oil rate” the government is compiling a list of the items it deems essential which can be imported at the preferential rate we are in the process of determining which exchange rates will be applicable to our imports into venezuela however currency exchange restrictions in venezuela restrict our ability to obtain us dollars at the official exchange rates us dollars may be obtained through a legal parallel exchange mechanism we have and may continue to use this mechanism to exchange bolivars for us dollars in order to satisfy us dollar denominated obligations of our venezuelan operations as such as of the end of our 2009 fiscal year we are using the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements to us dollars the impact of this change was not material to the consolidated financial statements despite rates implied by transactions in the parallel market being significantly higher than the official rates 

inflation in venezuela has been at relatively high levels over the past few years we use a blend of the national consumer price index and the consumer price index to determine whether venezuela is a highly inflationary economy the blended index exceeded 100 during the fourth quarter of 2009 and as such venezuela will be designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings we expect reported net sales and operating profit in latin america will be negatively impacted and it could be significant to our latin america operating segment on a consolidated basis venezuela represents only 1 to 2 of our business therefore the overall impact is expected to be minimal 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

during 2009 and 2008 we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes refer to disclosures contained in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was 1900 million and 750 million as of january 2 2010 and january 3 2009 respectively assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 22 million in 2009 and 21 million in 2008 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa paperboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap 

  

transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 146 million as of january 2 2010 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period at yearend 2008 the notional amount was 167 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2009 including the north america natural gas swaps was 213 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 16 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would increase by approximately 18 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2008 including the natural gas swaps was 267 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 16 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices this settlement obligation would increase by approximately 24 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount there were no collateral balance requirements at january 2 2010 or january 3 2009 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company

securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans 

 

  

three plans are considered “equity compensation plans not approved by security holders” the kellogg share incentive plan which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most uk employees of specified kellogg company subsidiaries a similar plan which is available to employees in the republic of ireland and the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors which was adopted in 1986 and amended in 1993 and 2002 

under the kellogg share incentive plan eligible uk employees may contribute up to 1500 pounds sterling annually to the plan through payroll deductions the trustees of the plan use those contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market value on the open market with kellogg matching those contributions on a 11 basis shares must be withdrawn from the plan when employees cease employment under current law eligible employees generally receive certain income and other tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a specified number of years a similar plan is also available to employees in the republic of ireland as these plans are open market plans with no set overall maximum no amounts for these plans are included in the above table however approximately 74000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under the kellogg share incentive plan the plan for the republic of ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2009 with approximately an additional 74000 shares being provided as matched shares 

  

under the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors nonemployee directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation other than expense reimbursement into units which are credited to their accounts the units have a value equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the appropriate date with dividend equivalents being earned on the whole units in nonemployee directors’ accounts units may be paid in either cash or shares of our common stock either in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments with the payments to begin as soon as practicable after the nonemployee director’s service as a director terminates no more than 150000 shares are authorized for use under this plan of which approximately 11000 had been issued as of january 2 2010 because directors may elect and are likely to elect a distribution of cash rather than shares the contingently issuable shares are not included in column a of the table above

 item 1a risk factors 

 

 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial 

condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

 

our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

 

 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

 

 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

 

 

as of january 3 2009 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 510 billion of which 364 billion was goodwill and 146 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 1095 billion and shareholders’ equity of 145 billion 

 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings from cost reduction initiatives 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of january 3 2009 we had total debt of approximately 546 billion and shareholders’ equity of 145 billion 

 

 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

 6 

  

  

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and financial business and other factors beyond our control 

 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings 

 

 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

 

 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

 

 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ability including manufacturing or distribution capabilities and that of our suppliers business partners and contract manufacturers to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather natural disaster fire or explosion terrorism pandemics strikes or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 20 of consolidated net sales during 2008 comprised principally of sales within the united states at january 3 2009 approximately 17 of our 

consolidated receivables balance and 27 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of net sales in 2008 during 2008 our top five customers collectively including walmart accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 42 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

 

 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar venezuelan bolivar fuerte russian rouble and mexican peso because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union and various state provincial and local governments as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies various state and local agencies also regulate our activities 

 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that is becoming increasingly burdensome those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety ingredients advertising relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental food quality and safety or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas we could be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions or recalls as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients 

 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

 

if our food products become adulterated or misbranded we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

 

selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage 

product tampering or other adulteration we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time for example in january 2009 we initiated a recall of certain austin and keebler branded peanut butter sandwich crackers and certain famous amos and keebler branded peanut butter cookies as a result of potential contamination of ingredients at a supplier’s facility the recall was expanded in late january and february to include bear naked  kashi and special k products impacted by that same supplier’s ingredients the costs of the recall negatively impacted gross margin and operating profit in fiscal 2008 we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless does not prevail or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands 

 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs furthermore a significant portion of the communications between our personnel customers and suppliers depends on information technology like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues we have technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate 

 

if we pursue strategic acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives with respect to acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable candidates consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or our divesture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products 

 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material affect on our market share and our profitability

results of operations 

 

 

 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

 

 

kellogg company is the world’s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods including cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks frozen waffles and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe latin america and asia pacific beginning in 2007 the asia pacific segment includes south africa which was formerly a part of europe prior years were restated for comparison purposes 

 

 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets these targets are low singledigit 1 to 3 for internal net sales mid singledigit 4 to 6 for internal operating profit and high singledigit 7 to 9 for net earnings per share on a currency neutral basis see “foreign currency translation” section on page 15 for an explanation of the company’s definition of currency neutral 

 

 

for our full year 2008 we exceeded our net sales target with reported net sales growth of 9 and internal growth of 54 consolidated operating profit increased 45 on internal growth of 42 in line with our target reported diluted earnings per share grew 8 within our target to 299 per share while currency neutral eps grew 10 

 

 

 

  

 

in combination with an attractive dividend yield we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders we believe we can achieve this sustainable growth through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business expanding our snacks business and pursuing selected growth opportunities we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profitrich sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital we believe our steady earnings growth strong cash flow and continued investment during a multiyear period of significant commodity and energydriven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model 

net sales and operating profit 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2008 versus 2007 

 

 

 

  

 

during 2008 our consolidated net sales increased almost 9 driven by our north america business with increases in both volume and pricemix for the year internal net sales grew over 5 building on a 5 rate of internal growth during 2007 we had a fiftythird week in our 2008 fiscal year which contributed almost 2 to our reported growth over the prior year as did our acquisitions for further information on our acquisitions refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 35 management has estimated the pro forma effect on the company’s results of operations as though these business combinations had been completed at the beginning of either 2008 or 2007 would have been immaterial successful innovation brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion investment as well as our recent price increases continued to drive growth declines in volume in both europe and latin america were more than offset by growth in pricingmix due to our price increases asia pacific had a particularly strong year experiencing growth of 8 driven by cereal sales across the operating segment 

 

for 2008 our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of almost 9 with internal net sales growth of 6 the growth was broad based and driven by our price realization and strong innovation the major product brands grew as follows retail cereal 3 retail snacks cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars and fruit snacks 6 frozen and specialty channels frozen foods food service and vending 9 while retail cereal grew 3 for the year we had a relatively soft share performance in the fourth quarter facing aggressive pricebased incentives from our competitors in addition while we estimate our consumption was up 2 across all channels reductions in trade inventory also adversely affected shipments as a result our fourth quarter internal net sales declined by 3 which was up against a tough comparable of 8 growth in the prior year our snacks business grew 6 in 2008 on top of 7 growth last year our growth came from volume price increases and successful innovations such as townhouse flipsides and cheezit duoz  we saw net sales growth in all product categories — toaster pastries crackers cookies and wholesome snacks our “right bites” 100 calorie cookie and cracker packs performed well as we saw an increase in demand for portion controlled portable food our specialty and frozen channels grew over 9 our food service business performed well achieving mid singledigit growth for the year frozen realized strong sales driven by innovations such as bake shop swirlz  mini muffin tops and french toast waffles  

 

 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 9 or 5 on an internal basis europe’s internal net sales grew by almost 4 attributable to pricemix as volume was down slightly the uk and continental europe have been impacted by the economic crisis which has consumers searching for value and retailers reducing inventory snacks products are performing well across the region especially in the uk driven by rice krispies squares  latin america’s internal net sales growth was 4 attributable to our price increases and driven by cereal sales in mexico and venezuela this year’s growth is on top of last year’s 9 growth volume was down for the year due to the economic environment which is impacting consumer confidence asia pacific had a very strong year with 8 internal net sales growth the growth was volume driven and broad based in both retail cereal and retail snacks 

 

 

consolidated operating profit grew by almost 5 on an as reported basis and 4 on an internal basis operating profit in all areas was impacted by significant cost pressures as discussed in more detail in the “margin performance” section beginning on page 14 north america grew by 6 driven by growth in net sales and lower exit costs which offset higher 

commodity costs costs associated with the peanutrelated recall of kellogg products adversely impacted north america’s operating profit by 34 million or 2 of the full year operating profit see the “subsequent event” section on page 18 for more details operating profit declined slightly in both europe and latin america due to increased commodity costs and cost reduction initiatives asia pacific’s operating profit increased 11 on an internal basis due to strong top line growth on a consolidated basis operating profit from acquisitions decreased internal operating profit by 1 in line with our expectations with europe and asia pacific being particularly impacted by our russian and chinese acquisitions respectively 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2007 versus 2006 

 

 

 

  

 

during 2007 our consolidated net sales increased 8 on strong results from broad based growth across our operating segments internal net sales grew over 5 building on a 7 rate of internal growth during 2006 successful innovation brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion investment and instore execution continued to drive broad based sales growth across each of our enterprisewide product groups in fact we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating segments 

 

 

for 2007 our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of 6 internal net sales grew over 5 with each major product group contributing as follows retail cereal 3 retail snacks cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks 7 frozen and specialty food service club stores vending convenience drug and value stores channels 6 the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business built on internal growth of 11 in 2006 

 

 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately 12 or 5 on an internal basis with leading dollar contributions from our businesses in the uk france mexico and venezuela internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents approximately 5 of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year as solid growth in asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australian business 

 

 

consolidated operating profit for 2007 grew 6 with internal operating profit up 3 versus 2006 for 2007 europe contributed a strong 14 internal growth rate driven by increased sales and stronger gross margins as well as lower upfront costs despite a strong sales performance operating profit in our north american segment was dampened by continued commodity cost pressures and significantly higher upfront costs associated with cost reduction initiatives as more fully discussed on page 16 our latin america and asia pacific operating segments suffered operating profit declines primarily driven by lower gross margins due to increased commodity costs as well as the previously mentioned weak performance in our australian business 

 

margin performance 

margin performance is presented in the following table 

 

 

 

  

 

we strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brandbuilding and innovation our strategy for increasing our gross profit is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements productivity savings and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging for 2008 our gross profit was up 188 million over 2007 an increase of 4 our gross profit would have increased by an additional 5 million excluding the impact of foreign currency 

 

 

our decline in gross margin for 2007 and 2008 reflects the impact of significant cost pressure with higher costs for commodities energy and fuel being partially offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives and increased 

pricing for 2008 these cost pressures represented 10 of 2007’s cost of goods sold primarily associated with our ingredient purchases in 2007 these cost pressures represented 6 of the prior year’s cost of goods sold in 2008 acquisitions negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points 

 

for 2009 we expect inflationary trends to continue although we plan to offset the expected 4 to 5 of cost pressures by savings from cost reduction initiatives of up to 4 to keep the gross margin percentage approximately flat year over year 

 

for 2008 our sga decreased over the prior year due to our strong net sales growth lower expense related to cost reduction initiatives recorded in sga continued discipline in overhead spending and efficiencies in advertising and promotion for 2007 our sga was negatively impacted by the reorganization of our direct storedoor delivery dsd operations total program costs of 77 million were recorded in sga expense as discussed further in the “exit or disposal activities” section 

 

 

foreign currency translation 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in the euro british pound mexican peso australian dollar and canadian dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 

 

the recent volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future us reported earnings as such we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis assuming earnings are translated at the prior year’s exchange rates this nongaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a better measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 

 

below is a reconciliation of reported diluted eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

  

exit or disposal activities 

we view our continued spending on costreduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our longterm profit growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion each costreduction initiative is normally up to three years in duration upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal activities for which material charges have been incurred we include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability 

 

cost summary 

for 2008 we recorded 27 million of costs associated with exit or disposal activities comprised of 7 million of asset write offs 17 million of severance and other cash costs and 3 million related to pension costs 23 million of the 2008 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the europe operating segment with the balance recorded in sga expense in the latin america operating segment

for 2006 we recorded charges of 82 million comprised of 20 million of asset writeoffs 30 million for severance and other exit costs 9 million for other cash expenditures 4 million for a 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability and 19 million for pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits 74 million was recorded in cost of goods sold within operating segment results and 8 million in sga expense within corporate results the company’s operating segments were impacted as follows in millions north america46 europe–28 

 

exit cost reserves at january 3 2009 were 2 million related to severance payments exit cost reserves were 5 million at december 29 2007 consisting of 2 million for severance and 3 million for lease termination payments 

 

specific initiatives 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we executed a costreduction initiative in latin america that resulted in the elimination of approximately 120 salaried positions the cost of the program was 4 million and was recorded in latin america’s sga expense the charge related primarily to severance benefits which were paid by the end of the year there were no reserves as of january 3 2009 related to this program 

 

we commenced a multiyear european manufacturing optimization plan in 2006 to improve utilization of our facility in manchester england and to better align production in europe the project resulted in an elimination of approximately 220 hourly and salaried positions from our manchester facility through voluntary early retirement and severance programs the pension trust funding requirements of these early retirements exceeded the recognized benefit expense by 5 million which was funded in 2006 during this program certain manufacturing equipment was removed from service 

 

all of the costs for the european manufacturing optimization plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within our europe operating segment the following tables present total project costs and a reconciliation of employee severance reserves for this initiative all other cash costs were paid in the period incurred the project was completed in 2008 

 

 

 

  

 

 

in october 2007 we committed to reorganize certain production processes at our plants in valls spain and bremen germany commencement of this plan followed consultation with union representatives at the bremen facility regarding the elimination of approximately 120 employee positions this reorganization plan improved manufacturing and distribution efficiency across the company’s continental european operations and has been completed as of the end of the company’s 2008 fiscal year 

 

all of the costs for european production process realignment have been recorded in cost of goods sold within our europe operating segment 

 

the following tables present total project costs and a reconciliation of employee severance reserves for this initiative all other cash costs were paid in the period incurred 

 

 

 

  

 

 

in july 2007 we began a plan to reorganize our direct storedoor delivery dsd operations in the southeastern united states this dsd reorganization plan was intended to integrate our southeastern sales and distribution regions with the rest of our us dsd operations resulting in greater efficiency across the nationwide network we exited approximately 517 distribution route franchise agreements with independent contractors the plan also resulted in the involuntary termination or relocation of approximately 300 employee positions total project costs incurred were 77 million principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise settlements and to a lesser extent for employee separation relocation and reorganization exit reserves were 3 million at december 29 2007 and were paid in 2008 all of the costs for the us dsd reorganization plan have been recorded in sga expense within our north america operating segment this initiative is complete 

 

during 2006 we commenced several initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our 

us cereal manufacturing network primarily through technological and sourcing improvements in warehousing and packaging operations in conjunction with these initiatives we offered voluntary separation incentives which resulted in the retirement of approximately 80 hourly employees by early 2007 during 2006 we incurred approximately 15 million of total upfront costs comprised of approximately 20 asset writeoffs and 80 cash costs including 10 million of pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses these initiatives were complete by the end of 2007 

 

also during 2006 we undertook an initiative to improve customer focus and selling efficiency within a particular latin american market leading to a shift from a thirdparty distributor to a direct sales force model as a result of this initiative we paid 8 million in cash during 2006 to exit the existing distribution arrangement 

 

during 2008 we finalized our pension plan withdrawal liability related to our north america snacks bakery consolidation which was executed in 2005 and 2006 the final liability was 20 million 16 million of which was recognized in 2005 and 4 million in 2006 and was paid in the third quarter of 2008 

 

other 2008 cost reduction initiatives 

in addition to investments in exit or disposal activities we undertook various other cost reduction initiatives during 2008 

 

we incurred 10 million of expense in connection with a payment for the restructuring of our labor force at a manufacturing facility in mexico this cost was recorded in cost of goods sold in the latin america operating segment 

 

we also incurred 17 million of expense for the elimination of the accelerated ownership feature of certain employee stock options refer to note 8 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information this expense was recorded in sga expense within corporate results 

 

during 2008 we also began a lean manufacturing initiative in certain us latin american and european manufacturing facilities we are referring to this initiative as k lean which stands for kellogg’s lean efficient agile network this program will ensure we are optimizing our manufacturing network reducing waste developing best practices across our global facilities and reducing future capital expenditures we incurred costs of 12 million for consulting recorded in cost of goods sold primarily within our north america operating segment the total cost and cash outlay for this program is estimated to be 65 million this project is expected to be primarily complete by the end of 2009 

 

 

interest expense 

as illustrated in the following table annual interest expense for the 20062008 period has been relatively steady which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time interest income recorded in other income expense net increased from approximately 11 million in 2006 to 20 million in 2008 resulting in net interest expense of approximately 288 million for 2008 we currently expect that our 2009 gross interest expense will be approximately 280 million 

 

 

 

  

other income expense net 

other income expense net includes nonoperating items such as interest income charitable donations and gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange and commodity derivatives other income expense net for the periods presented was in millions 2008–12 2007–2 2006–13 the variability in other income expense net among years reflects the timing of certain charges explained in the following paragraph 

 

charges for contributions to the kellogg’s corporate citizenship fund a private trust established for charitable giving were as follows in millions 2008–4 2007–12 2006–3 interest income was in millions 2008–20 2007–23 2006–11 net foreign currency exchange gains losses were in millions 2008–5 2007–8 2006–2 income expense recognized for premiums on commodity options was in millions 2008–12 2007–7 2006–0 gains losses on company owned life insurance “coli” due to changes in cash surrender value were in millions 2008–12 2007–9 2006–12 

 

 

income taxes 

our longterm objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 30 in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of repatriating foreign earnings our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for 2008 was 31 and was 32 for both 2007 and 2006 we currently expect our 2009 sustainable rate to be approximately 31 our reported rates of 297 for 2008 and 287 for 2007 were lower than the sustainable rate due to the 

favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information for 2009 we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 30 to 31 this could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also impact the effective tax rate as it is dependent upon the us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates 

 

 

subsequent event 

on january 14 2009 we announced a precautionary hold on certain austin and keebler branded peanut butter sandwich crackers and certain famous amos and keebler branded peanut butter cookies while the us food and drug administration and other authorities investigated peanut corporation of america “pca” one of kellogg’s peanut paste suppliers for the cracker and cookie products on january 16 2009 kellogg voluntarily recalled those products because the paste ingredients supplied to kellogg had the potential to be contaminated with salmonella the recall was expanded on january 31 february 2 and february 17 2009 to include certain bear naked  kashi and special k products impacted by pca ingredients 

 

 

we have incurred costs associated with the recalls and in accordance with us gaap we recorded certain items associated with this subsequent event in our fiscal year 2008 financial results 

 

 

the charges associated with the recalls reduced north america fullyear 2008 operating profit by 34 million or 006 of eps we expect a similar impact in 2009 of the total 2008 charges 12 million related to estimated customer returns and consumer rebates and was recorded as a reduction to net sales 21 million related to costs associated with returned product and the disposal and writeoff of inventory which was recorded as cost of goods sold and 1 million related to other costs which were recorded as sga expense 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions our cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 

 

credit environment 

the us and global economies began a period of uncertainty starting in 2007 financial markets continue to experience unprecedented volatility beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and thereafter global capital and credit markets including commercial paper markets experienced increased instability and disruption 

 

 

our company’s financial strength was evident throughout this period of uncertainty as we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets although interest rates on our us commercial paper increased by an average of 200 basis points during the period from midseptember through october 2008 the average interest rate we paid for commercial paper borrowings in 2008 declined to 35 from an average of 54 in 2007 our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected by the changes in the credit environment and the amount of our total debt outstanding remained relatively flat over the past three years 

 

 

if needed we have additional sources of liquidity available to us these sources include our access to public debt andor equity markets and the ability to sell trade receivables our fiveyear credit agreement which expires in 2011 allows us to borrow up to 20 billion on a revolving credit basis this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis although we do not currently plan to use it 

 

 

we monitor the financial strength of our thirdparty financial institutions including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities our derivative financial instruments and other arrangements 

 

 

we believe that our operating cash flows together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

 

operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding based on a trailing 12 month average is relatively short equating to approximately 22 days for 2008 24 days for 2007 and 26 days for 2006 the decrease in 2008 was the result of a decrease in days of inventory outstanding while the decrease in 2007 reflected an increase in days of trade payables outstanding 

the following table presents the major components of our operating cash flow during the current and prior yeartodate periods 

 

 

 

  

 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 was 236 million lower than 2007 due primarily to a substantial increase in pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2008 and an unfavorable yearoveryear variance in other working capital partially offsetting the decrease was the impact of changes in deferred income taxes and a favorable variance in core working capital 

 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was 93 million higher than the comparable period of 2006 due primarily to growth in cashbasis earnings and favorable total working capital performance as compared to 2006 the favorable movement in core working capital during 2007 was related principally to higher accounts payable which were due in part to increased payment terms in international locations 

 

in 2008 core working capital was an average of 62 of net sales an improvement of 06 compared with 2007 in 2007 core working capital was an average of 68 of net sales consistent with 2006 we manage core working capital through timely collection of accounts receivable extending terms on accounts payable and careful monitoring of inventory 

 

other working capital in 2008 reflected an increase in cash paid associated with hedging programs cash paid for advertising and promotion and the impact of changes in accrued salaries and wages other working capital in 2007 was a use of cash versus a source of cash in 2006 the difference related to a yearoveryear increase in the amount of income tax payments 

 

recent adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed longterm rate of return of 89 as a result we decided to make additional contributions to our pension and postretirement plans amounting to 400 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 our total pension and postretirement plan funding for 2008 totaled 451 million while funding in 2007 and 2006 amounted to 96 million and 99 million respectively 

 

in 2006 the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans the ppa will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our us plans we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2011 our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

 

we currently project that we will make total us and foreign plan contributions in 2009 of approximately 100 million actual 2009 contributions could be different from our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements trust asset performance renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience 

 

our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchases our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 

 

our 2008 cash flow as defined reflects the impact of the additional pension contributions we made in the fourth quarter of 2008 for 2009 we are expecting cash flow as defined in the range of 1050 million to 1150 million this projection assumes an adverse impact on 2009 cash flow of approximately 100 million associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates we expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth lower contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2009 and continued prudent management of our working capital 

investing activities 

our net cash used in investing activities for 2008 amounted to 681 million an increase of 80 million compared with 2007 net cash used in investing activities of 601 million in 2007 increased by 156 million compared with 2006 

 

cash paid for acquisitions during 2008 and 2007 were the primary drivers of increases in cash used in investing activities as we expanded our platform for future growth with acquisitions in russia china the us and australia acquisitions are discussed in note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to 36 in 2008 40 in 2007 and 42 in 2006 in 2008 capital spending consisted primarily of construction costs to increase capacity in europe and to expand our global research center in battle creek michigan in 2007 we made capacity expansions to accommodate sales growth including the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in chicago illinois 

 

we expect our k lean manufacturing efficiency initiative to result in a trend toward lower capital spending going forward our longterm target for capital spending is between 30 and 40 of net sales 

 

our 2009 capital plan includes spending for a new facility to manufacture readytoeat cereal in mexico and continued spending on the ongoing project to expand the global research center in battle creek michigan the expansion of the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research reflects our commitment to research and innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business 

 

 

financing activities 

our net cash used in financing activities for 2008 2007 and 2006 amounted to 780 million 788 million and 789 million respectively 

 

in march 2008 we issued 750 million of fiveyear 425 fixed rate us dollar notes under an existing shelf registration statement we used proceeds of 746 million from issuance of this longterm debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper in conjunction with this debt issuance we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 750 million which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the fiveyear term in 2008 we had cash outflows of 465 million in connection with the repayment of fiveyear us dollar notes at maturity in june 2008 that debt had an effective interest rate of 335 

 

in january 2007 we increased our available credit via a 400 million unsecured 364day credit agreement the 400 million credit agreement expired in january 2008 and we decided not to renew it in february 2007 we redeemed euro notes for 728 million to partially finance this redemption we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies in december 2007 the company issued 750 million of fiveyear 5125 fixed rate us dollar notes under the existing shelf registration statement using the proceeds to replace a portion of our us commercial paper 

 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 we repurchased 650 million of our common stock each year under programs authorized by our board of directors the number of shares repurchased amounted to approximately 13 million 12 million and 15 million shares respectively in 2008 2007 and 2006 the 2006 activity consisted principally of a private transaction with the w k kellogg foundation trust to repurchase approximately 13 million shares for 550 million on february 4 2009 the board of directors authorized a 650 million share repurchase authorization for 2009 that we plan to execute largely in the second half of the year the board also canceled a 500 million share repurchase authorization that it had authorized in third quarter 2008 we made no purchases under the 500 million share repurchase authorization because of our decision to use cash to fund pension plans and reduce commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 130 per share in 2008 1202 per share in 2007 and 1137 per share in 2006 cash paid for dividends increased by 82 in 2008 and by 57 in 2007 our objective is to maintain our dividend payout ratio between 40 and 50 of reported net earnings 

 

at january 3 2009 our total debt was 55 billion approximately level with the balance at yearend 2007 our longterm debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions some agreements also contain change in control provisions however they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our aforementioned credit facilities 

 

we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow our shortterm borrowings and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and other obligations 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 3 2009 and december 29 2007 the company did not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations further information on debt obligations is contained in note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements further information on lease obligations is contained in note 6 further information on uncertain tax positions is contained in note 11 

 

 

  

 

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates 

 

 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as instore displays and events feature price discounts consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 03 of our company’s net sales however our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately 40 of 2008 net sales therefore it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we follow statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in evaluating impairment of intangibles we perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process under sfas no 142 goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction similarly impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

 

we also apply the principles of sfas no 142 in evaluating the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing 

regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

 

at january 3 2009 goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to 51 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company within this total approximately 14 billion of nongoodwilll intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler trademarks we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company however if we had used materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our north american snacks business or a different weightedaverage cost of capital in the valuation this could have resulted in significant impairment losses andor amortization expense 

 

 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we follow sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees’ active working life inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 70 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 25 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2008 of 89 equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of our 2008 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 30 of our global benefit plan assets 

 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 3 2009 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2009 benefits expense by approximately 31 million correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2008 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 13 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2008 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 1 million in 2010 increasing to approximately 5 million in 2014 for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceededwas less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2008–1528 2007–99 2006–257 

 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost 

growth rate of approximately 5 our initial trend rate for 2009 of 75 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 05 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 45 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at january 3 2009 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2009 benefits expense by approximately 15 million a 100 basis point excess of 2009 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 9 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 106 the net experience gain arising from recognition of 2008 claims experience was approximately 4 million 

 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index ® for our us plans to test the appropriateness of these indices we periodically conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and the bond maturities consisting principally of aarated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions noncallable issues with at least 25 million principal outstanding the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due for those years where no suitable bonds are available the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years during 2008 we refined our methodology for setting our discount rate by inputting the cash flows for our pension postretirement and postemployment plans into the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end accordingly we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 

 

based on consolidated obligations at january 3 2009 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2009 benefits expense by approximately 13 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of january 3 2009 we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 19 billion as compared to approximately 06 billion at december 29 2007 the yearoveryear increase in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to poor asset performance during 2008 of the total unamortized amounts at january 3 2009 approximately 15 billion was related to asset losses during 2008 with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate prior to 2008 for 2009 we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately 11 million higher than the actual 2008 amount of approximately 58 million total employee benefit expense for 2009 is expected to be slightly higher than 2008 due to increased amortization of experience losses which is offset by assumed asset returns on our 2008 contributions based on our current actuarial assumptions we expect 2010 pension expense to increase significantly primarily due to the amortization of net experience losses 

 

during 2008 we made contributions in the amount of 354 million to kellogg’s global taxqualified pension programs this amount was mostly discretionary we anticipate having to make additional contributions in future years to make up for the poor performance of global equity markets during 2008 additionally we contributed 97 million to our retiree medical programs most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits 

 

assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2008 amount 

 

 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense we establish tax reserves in accordance with fasb interpretation no 48 ‘‘accounting for uncertainty in income taxes“ fin no 48 which we adopted at the beginning of 2007 fin no 48 is based on a benefit recognition model which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain 

circumstances prior to the adoption of fin no 48 our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution the initial application of fin no 48 resulted in a net decrease to the company’s consolidated accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately 2 million with an offsetting increase to retained earnings 

 

the company evaluates a tax position in twosteps in accordance with fin no 48 the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythan not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position in weighing the technical merits of the position we consider the facts and circumstances of the position we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythan not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements while reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes the company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer morelikelythan not of being sustained 

 

for the periods presented our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately 175 million reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1 of earnings before income taxes annually significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

the current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other liabilities likewise the current portion of related interest reserves are presented in the balance sheet within accrued other current liabilities with the amount expected to be settled after one year recorded in other liabilities

new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

future outlook 

 

for 2009 despite a tough economic outlook we expect our business model and strategy will deliver internal net sales growth of 3 to 4 and internal operating profit growth of mid singledigits 4 to 6 which are in line with our longterm annual growth targets we expect our earnings per share to grow at high singledigits 7 to 9 on a currency neutral basis gross profit margin percentage is expected to remain approximately flat as our cost reduction initiatives and price realization offset pressure on cost of goods sold gross interest expense for 2009 is expected to decline to approximately 280 million driven by lower shortterm interest rates our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 30 to 31 we continue to remain committed to investing in brand building costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities lastly we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2009 cash flow to be between 1050 million and 1150 million after capital expenditures 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 

 

 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to thirdparty purchases intercompany loans and product shipments our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro in addition we have operations located in venezuela where the local currency is exposed to a highly volatile economic environment we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2008 was 924 million representing a settlement receivable of 22 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2007 was 570 million representing a settlement obligation of 9 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement receivable would have decreased by approximately 92 million at yearend 2008 and the settlement obligation would have increased by 57 million at yearend 2007 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

 

 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

 

in connection with the issuance of us dollar notes on march 6 2008 we entered into interest rate swaps refer to disclosures contained in note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at yearend 2007 assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 21 million in 2008 and 19 million in 2007 

 

 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa paperboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 167 million as of january 3 2009 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs at yearend 2007 the notional amount was 188 million 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2008 including the north america natural gas swaps was 267 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 16 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would increase by approximately 24 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2007 including the natural gas swaps was 229 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 22 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices this settlement receivable would decrease by approximately 22 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

 

in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount there were no collateral balance requirements at january 3 2009 or december 29 2007 

 

in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials including rice sugar cartonboard and corrugated boxes the company has contracts in place with its suppliers that provide for pricing that is lower than market prices at january 3 2009 it should be noted the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company

the trademarks listed above among others when taken as a whole are important to our business certain individual trademarks are also important to our business depending on the jurisdiction trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use andor their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use 

 

 

we consider that taken as a whole the rights under our various patents which expire from time to time are a valuable asset but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a valuable asset but are not believed to be material 

 

 

seasonality demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays we also custombake cookies for the girl scouts of the usa which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year

customers our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 19 of consolidated net sales during 2007 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 29 2007 approximately 13 of our consolidated receivables balance and 21 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates during 2007 our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 40 of us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments

competition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories both domestically and internationally our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products which are typically distributed at lower prices and generally with other food products principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions product quality taste convenience nutritional value price advertising and promotion

 item 1a r isk f actors tableend  

 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

 

 

our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

 

 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

 

 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

 

 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

 

 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our 

new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

 

 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

 

 

as of december 29 2007 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 497 billion of which 352 billion was goodwill and 145 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 114 billion and shareholders’ equity of 253 billion 

 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings from cost reduction initiatives 

 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

 

 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of december 29 2007 we had total debt of approximately 523 billion and shareholders’ equity of 253 billion 

 

 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

 

  

 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

 

 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in 

addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

 

 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial conditions 

 

 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits   

 

 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 19 of consolidated net sales during 2007 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 29 2007 approximately 13 of our consolidated receivables balance and 21 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates during 2007 our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 40 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands   

 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights including particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

 

 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition   

 

 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union and various state provincial and local governments as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies various state and local agencies also regulate our activities 

 

 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that is becoming increasingly onerous those regulations control such matters as ingredients advertising relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements 

trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating results   

 

 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency to the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately our consolidated results of operations may be negatively affected 

 

if our food products become adulterated or misbranded we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

 

 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands 

 

technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

 

 

we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information for example our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs furthermore a significant portion of the communications between our personnel customers and suppliers depends on information technology like other companies our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control including but not limited to natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues we have technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place or in process to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate

results of operations 

 

 

overview 

 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

 

 

kellogg company is the world’s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods including cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks frozen waffles and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe latin america and asia pacific beginning in 2007 the asia pacific segment includes south africa which was formerly a part of europe prior years were restated for comparison purposes 

 

 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets during the periods presented these targets were low singledigit for internal net sales low to mid singledigit for internal operating profit and high singledigit for net earnings per share 

 

 

 

  

 

in combination with an attractive dividend yield we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders we plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business expanding our snacks business and pursuing selected growth opportunities we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profitrich sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital we believe our steady earnings growth strong cash flow and continued investment during a multiyear period of significant commodity and energydriven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model 

 

 

 

net sales and operating profit 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2007 versus 2006 

 

 

 

  

 

during 2007 our consolidated net sales increased 8 on strong results from broadbased growth across our operating segments internal net sales grew over 5 building on a 7 rate of internal growth during 2006 successful innovation brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion investment and instore 

execution continued to drive broadbased sales growth across each of our enterprisewide product groups in fact we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating segments 

 

 

for 2007 our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of 6 internal net sales grew over 5 with each major product group contributing as follows retail cereal 3 retail snacks cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks 7 frozen and specialty food service club stores vending convenience drug and value stores channels 6 the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business built on internal growth of 11 in 2006 the 2007 growth in north america retail cereal sales represented the 7th consecutive year in which we’ve increased our dollar share of category sales 

 

 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately 12 or 5 on an internal basis with leading dollar contributions from our businesses in the uk france mexico and venezuela internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents approximately 5 of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year as solid growth in asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australian business 

 

 

consolidated operating profit for 2007 grew 6 with internal operating profit up 3 versus 2006 for 2007 europe contributed a strong 14 internal growth rate driven by increased sales and stronger gross margins as well as lower upfront costs despite a strong sales performance operating profit in our north american segment was dampened by continued commodity cost pressures and significantly higher upfront costs associated with cost reduction initiatives as more fully discussed on page 16 as previously predicted our latin america and asia pacific operating segments suffered operating profit declines primarily driven by lower gross margins due to increased commodity costs as well as the previously mentioned weak performance in our australian business 

 

 

our currentyear operating profit growth was also affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the “ margin performance ” section beginning on page 14 expenditures for brandbuilding activities increased at a mid singledigit rate this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns within our total brandbuilding advertising expenditures grew at a doubledigit rate for 2007 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2006 versus 2005 

 

 

 

  

 

during 2006 our consolidated net sales increased 7 on both an asreported and internal basis building on a 6 rate of internal growth during 2005 

 

 

for 2006 our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of 8 internal net sales growth was also 8 with each major product group contributing as follows retail cereal 3 retail snacks cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks 11 frozen and specialty food service vending convenience and drug stores custom manufacturing channels 8 the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business represented nearly onehalf of the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for 2006 the 2006 growth in north america retail cereal sales was on top of 8 growth in 2005 and represented the 6th consecutive year in which we’ve increased our dollar share of category sales although north america consumer retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout 2006 our shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of 2006 by approximately 2 versus the prioryear period we believe this decline was largely attributable to yearend retail trade inventory adjustments which brought inventories in line with yearend 2005 levels after several successive quarters of slight inclines 

 

 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately 6 or 5 on an internal basis with leading dollar contributions 

from our uk france mexico and venezuela business units internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents approximately 5 of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year as solid growth in australia cereal and asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australia snack business 

 

 

consolidated operating profit for 2006 grew 1 with internal operating profit up 4 versus 2005 as discussed on page 12 our measure of internal operating profit growth is consistent with our measure of internal sales growth except that during 2006 internal operating profit growth also excluded the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated with our adoption of sfas no 123r we used this nongaap financial measure during our first year of adopting this fasb standard in order to assist management and investors in assessing the company’s financial operating performance against comparative periods which did not include stock optionrelated compensation expense accordingly corporate selling general and administrative sga expense was higher and operating profit was lower by 65 million for 2006 reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately four percentage points refer to the section beginning on page 24 entitled “ stock compensation ” for further information on the company’s adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

 

although total 2006 upfront costs of 82 million were not significantly changed from the 2005 amount of 90 million a yearoveryear shift in operating segment allocation of such costs affected relative segment performance the 2006 versus 2005 change in project cost allocation was a 44 million decline in north america improving 2006 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4 and a 28 million increase in europe reducing 2006 segment operating profit performance by approximately 8 

 

 

for 2006 operating profit growth was affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the “ margin performance ” section expenditures for brandbuilding activities increased at a low singledigit rate this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns within our total brandbuilding metric advertising expenditures grew at a high singledigit rate for 2006 

 

margin performance 

margin performance is presented in the following table 

 

 

 

  

 

we strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brandbuilding and innovation expenditures our strategy for increasing our gross profit is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements productivity savings and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging for 2007 our gross profit was up 7 over 2006 an increase of 350 million 

 

 

our gross margin performance for 2006 and 2007 reflects the impact of significant fuel energy and commodity price inflation experienced throughout most of that time as well as increased employee benefit costs in 2006 in the aggregate these input cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin by approximately 155 basis points for 2007 and 150 basis points in 2006 for 2006 our gross margin performance was also unfavorably impacted by incremental logistics and innovation startup costs related to the significant sales growth within our north america operating segment 

 

 

the majority of the inflationary pressure during 2006 and 2007 was commodity and energydriven total active and retired employee benefits expense was approximately 285 million in 2007 versus 325 million in 2006 and 290 million in 2005 for 2008 the combined effect of favorable trust asset performance in prior years and rising discount rates is expected to have a moderating effect on underlying benefit cost inflation as a result we expect 2008 benefits expense to be approximately 10 lower than 2007 

 

 

for 2008 we expect inflationary trends to accelerate with net input cost fuel energy commodity and benefits pressures forecasted to exceed realized savings as compared to 2007 results we currently expect incremental cost inflation primarily associated with the prices of our 2008 ingredient purchases to be greater than 65 per share accordingly we believe our 2008 consolidated gross margin could decline by approximately 100 basis points which includes an approximately 40 basis point reduction related to our acquisitions and an approximately 30 basis point 

reduction due to higher upfront costs expected in cost of goods sold 

 

 

in addition to external cost pressures our discretionary investment in costreduction initiatives refer to following section has created variability in our gross margin performance during the periods presented although total annual programrelated charges were relatively steady over the past several years the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied by year in millions 2007–23 2006–74 2005–90 additionally cost of goods sold for 2005 includes a charge of approximately 12 million related to a lumpsum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our us cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the company covering the fouryear period ended october 2009 

 

 

for 2006 both our sga and operating margin were affected by our fiscal 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r during 2006 we reported incremental stock compensation expense of 65 million which increased our sga and reduced our operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2006 refer to the section beginning on page 24 entitled “ stock compensation ” for further information on this subject 

 

 

for 2007 our sga was negatively impacted by the reorganization of our direct storedoor delivery dsd operations total program costs of 77 million were recorded in sga expense as discussed further in the “ exit or disposal plans” section 

 

 

 

exit or disposal plans 

we view our continued spending on costreduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in meeting longterm growth targets initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion each costreduction initiative is normally one to three years in duration upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation which is then reinvested in the business certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal plans for which material charges will be incurred we include these charges in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the “net sales and operating profit” section beginning on page 12 

 

 

in 2006 we commenced a multiyear european manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in manchester england and to better align production in europe based on forecasted foreign exchange rates the company currently expects to incur approximately 55 million in total upfront costs including 28 million recorded in 2006 and 19 million recorded in 2007 with the remainder to be incurred in 2008 the cost is comprised of approximately 90 cash expenditures and 10 noncash asset writeoffs the cash portion of the total upfront costs results principally from management’s plan to eliminate approximately 220 hourly and salaried positions from the manchester facility by the end of 2008 through voluntary early retirement and severance programs the pension trust funding requirements of these early retirements are expected to exceed the recognized benefit expense impact by approximately 5 million most of this incremental funding occurred in 2006 during the program certain manufacturing equipment will also be removed from service 

 

 

all of the costs for the european manufacturing optimization plan have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the company’s european operating segment the following tables present total project costs to date and a reconciliation of employee severance reserves for this initiative all other cash costs were paid in the period incurred 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

in october 2007 we committed to reorganize certain production processes between our plants in valls spain and bremen germany commencement of this plan follows consultation with union representatives at the bremen facility regarding the elimination of approximately 120 employee positions this reorganization plan is specifically intended to improve manufacturing and distribution efficiency across our continental european operations and is expected to be completed by mid 2008 based on forecasted foreign exchange rates we expect to incur approximately 25 million of total project costs comprised of approximately 50 asset writeoffs and 50 employee separation benefits and other cash costs the company recorded 4 million of costs in 2007 with the remaining to be incurred in 2008 

all of the costs for the european production process realignment have been recorded in cost of goods sold within the company’s european operating segment 

 

 

the following tables present total project costs to date and a reconciliation of employee severance reserves for this initiative all other cash costs were paid in the period incurred 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

in july 2007 management commenced a plan to reorganize the company’s direct storedoor delivery dsd operations in the southeastern united states this dsd reorganization plan is intended to integrate the company’s southeastern sales and distribution regions with the rest of its us direct storedoor operations resulting in greater efficiency across the nationwide network in preparation for this initiative in june 2007 the company began to extend offers to exit approximately 517 distribution route franchise agreements with independent contractors which were substantially accepted as of july 2007 the plan resulted in the involuntary termination or relocation of approximately 300 employee positions total project costs incurred were 77 million principally consisting of cash expenditures for route franchise settlements and to a lesser extent for employee separation relocation and reorganization this initiative was substantially complete by the end of 2007 

 

 

all of the costs for the us dsd reorganization plan have been recorded in selling general and administrative expense within the company’s north america operating segment the following tables present total project costs to date exit cost reserves were approximately 3 million as of december 29 2007 primarily related to lease termination costs all other cash costs were paid in the period incurred 

 

 

 

  

 

during 2006 we implemented several shortterm initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our us cereal manufacturing network and streamlined our sales distribution system in a latin american market in 2005 we undertook an initiative to consolidate us snacks bakery capacity resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by mid 2006 these initiatives were substantially complete at december 30 2006 details of each initiative are described in note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

for 2007 the company recorded total programrelated charges of approximately 100 million comprised of 7 million of asset writeoffs 72 million for severance and other exit costs including route franchise settlements 15 million for other cash expenditures and 6 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability approximately 23 million of the total 2007 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the europe operating segment results with approximately 77 million recorded in sga expense within the north america operating results 

 

 

for 2006 the company recorded total programrelated charges of approximately 82 million comprised of 20 million of asset writeoffs 30 million for severance and other exit costs 9 million for other cash expenditures 4 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability and 19 million for pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits approximately 74 million of the total 2006 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating segment results with approximately 8 million recorded in sga expense within corporate results the company’s operating segments were impacted as follows in millions north america46 europe28 

 

 

for 2005 total programrelated charges were approximately 90 million comprised of 16 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability 44 million of asset writeoffs 21 million in severance and other exit costs and 9 million for other cash expenditures all of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within our north america operating segment 

for the periods presented cash requirements to implement these programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges incurred in each year except for approximately 8 million of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in 2006 in connection with the european manufacturing optimization plan at december 29 2007 the company’s remaining cash commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of exit cost reserves of 5 million expected to be paid out in 2008 and estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities of 26 million which will not be finally determined until 2008 and once determined are payable to the pension fund over a 20year maximum period we expect these cash requirements to be funded by operating cash flow 

 

 

our 2008 earnings target includes total projected charges related to inprogress and potential costreduction initiatives of approximately 80 million or 14 per share approximately onethird of this total is allocated to the aforementioned european projects however the specific cash versus noncash mix or cost of goods sold versus sga expense impact of the remainder has not yet been determined other potential initiatives to be commenced in 2008 are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as we commit to these discretionary investments 

 

 

 

interest expense 

as illustrated in the following table annual interest expense for the 20052007 period has been relatively steady which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time interest income recorded in other income has trended upward from approximately 9 million in 2005 to 23 million in 2007 resulting in net interest expense of approximately 296 million for 2007 we currently expect that our 2008 net interest expense will be comparable to the 2007 amount 

 

 

 

  

other income expense net 

other income expense net includes nonoperating items such as interest income charitable donations and gains and losses related to foreign exchange and commodity derivatives other income expense net for the periods presented was in millions 20072 200613 200525 the variability in other income expense net among years reflects the timing of certain significant charges explained in the following paragraph 

 

 

other expense includes charges for contributions to the kellogg’s corporate citizenship fund a private trust established for charitable giving as follows in millions 2007–12 2006–3 2005–16 other expense for 2005 also includes a charge of approximately 7 million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value this facility was sold in august 2006 

 

 

 

income taxes 

our longterm objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 31 in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of repatriating foreign earnings our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was approximately 33 with the rate for 2006 and 2007 at approximately 32 we currently expect our 2008 sustainable rate to be approximately 31 in line with our objective our reported rates of approximately 29 for 2007 and 31 for 2005 were lower than the sustainable rate due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information for 2008 we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 31 this could be impacted however if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

overview 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions this cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs during 2007 we believe our company’s financial strength has been especially evident in the face of the recent us subprime mortgage market crisis and its pervasive effect on general credit market liquidity for the year we continued to have access to the us commercial paper market without significant increase in our effective shortterm borrowing rate and our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected our annual interest expense for the 20052007 period has been relatively steady which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time we have not had any significant new borrowings under our euro or canadian commercial paper programs since june 2007 which has limited our exposure to nonus credit market illiquidity during this turbulent period 

 

 

 

operating activities 

the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding is relatively short equating to approximately 27 days for the trailing 365day period ended december 29 2007 an improvement to the comparable prior year period which was 29 days as a result our operating cash flow should generally reflect our net earnings performance over time although as illustrated in the following schedule specific results for any particular year may be significantly affected by the level of benefit plan contributions working capital movements operating assets and liabilities and other factors 

 

 

 

  

 

our net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was 93 million higher than the comparable period of 2006 due primarily to growth in cashbasis earnings and favorable total working capital performance operating cash flow for 2006 was approximately 267 million higher than 2005 due primarily to lower benefit plan contributions partially offset by unfavorable working capital movements the decline in benefit plan contributions for 2006 and 2007 as compared to 2005 reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit plans that was achieved through a significant amount of funding in the 20032005 period 

 

 

on august 17 2006 the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans most of these provisions are first applicable to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2008 on a phasedin basis the ppa will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our us plans however due to our historical funding practices we currently believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under the new ppa requirements until after 2013 accordingly we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several years with total 2008 us and foreign plan contributions currently estimated at approximately 63 million actual 2008 contributions could exceed our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements renewals of union contracts or 

higherthanexpected health care claims cost experience additionally our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

 

 

as compared to 2006 the favorable movement in core working capital during 2007 was related principally to higher trade payables which are due in part to increased payment terms in international locations during 2007 our trade payables balance increased by almost 19 from year end 2006 in contrast our december 30 2006 trade payables balance was within 3 of the balance at yearend 2005 

 

 

for the trailing fiftytwo weeks ended december 29 2007 core working capital was 68 of net sales consistent with yearend 2006 as compared to 70 as of yearend 2005 we have been able to maintain this level through the timely collection of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables offset by slightly higher inventory levels 

 

 

in comparison to 2005 the unfavorable movement in core working capital during 2006 was related to trade payables performance and higher inventory balances the higher inventory balance was principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent the overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on hand our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably affected by us capacity limitations during 2006 

 

 

as presented in the table on page 18 other working capital was a use of cash in 2007 versus a source of cash in 2006 the difference relates to yearoveryear increase in the amount of income tax payments the favorable movement in other working capital in 2006 as compared to 2005 was attributable to several factors including lower debtrelated currency swap payments in 2006 as well as businessrelated growth in accrued compensation and promotional liabilities 

 

 

investing activities 

our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchase our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 

 

 

our cash flow as defined performance during the periods presented reflects increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our company’s strong sales growth over the past several years this increased capital spending represented 40 of net sales in 2007 and 42 of net sales in 2006 as compared to 37 of net sales in 2005 for 2008 we currently expect property expenditures to remain at approximately 40 of net sales which is consistent with our longterm target for capital spending this forecast includes expenditures associated with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in kutno poland and expansion of our global research center in battle creek michigan which together represents approximately 15 of our 2008 capital plan the facility in poland will help us meet consumer demand for our readytoeat cereals in the emerging central and eastern european markets the expansion of the w k kellogg institute for food and nutrition research reflects our commitment to research and innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business 

 

 

for 2008 we are expecting cash flow to be broadly in line with our 2007 results we expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth and prudent management of our working capital 

 

 

as discussed in note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements our property additions for 2007 include approximately 16 million for the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in chicago illinois 

 

 

as discussed in note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements in order to support the continued growth of our north america operating segment the company completed two separate business acquisitions in late 2007 for a total of approximately 123 million in cash including related transaction costs on november 1 2007 a subsidiary of the company acquired 100 of the equity interests in bear naked inc a leading seller of premiumbranded natural granola products on november 5 2007 the company acquired certain assets and liabilities of the wholesome  hearty foods company a us manufacturer of veggie foods marketed under the gardenburger ® brand 

to expand the company’s presence in eastern europe on january 16 2008 subsidiaries of the company acquired substantially all of the equity interests in ojsc kreker doing business as “united bakers” and consolidated subsidiaries for approximately 117 million in cash including transaction fees incurred to date and 3 million in assumed debt the company expects to acquire the remaining minority interests through tender offers initiated during 2008 united bakers is a leading producer of cereal cookie and cracker products in russia with 4000 employees six manufacturing facilities and a broad distribution network the business realized approximately 100 million of revenues in 2007 due to various factors including accounting principle conformity these revenues are not necessarily indicative of the pro forma incremental effect on the company’s 2007 consolidated net sales assuming this business combination had been completed at the beginning of 2007 the purchase agreement between the company and the seller provides for the payment of a currently undeterminable amount of contingent consideration at the end of three years provided certain financial performance metrics are achieved such payment would be recognized as additional purchase price when the contingency is resolved as part of the aforementioned initial purchase price for this acquisition the company incurred approximately 5 million in transaction fees and cash advances during 2007 which we classified as business acquisitionrelated investing cash outflows in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 29 2007 

 

 

in order to support the continued growth of our north american fruit snacks business we completed two separate business acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately 50 million in cash including related transaction costs in june 2005 we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from kraft foods inc the facility is located in chicago illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly and salaried employees in november 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a washington statebased manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks 

 

 

 

financing activities 

for 2007 our board of directors authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to 650 million which we spent to repurchase approximately 12 million shares pursuant to similar board authorizations applicable to those years we paid 650 million in 2006 to repurchase approximately 15 million shares and 664 million in 2005 to repurchase approximately 16 million shares the 2006 activity consisted principally of a february 2006 private transaction with the w k kellogg foundation trust “the trust” to repurchase approximately 13 million shares for 550 million the 2005 activity consisted principally of a november 2005 private transaction with the trust to repurchase approximately 9 million shares for 400 million for 2008 our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 650 million 

 

 

our company paid dividends to shareholders in 2007 in the amount of 1202 per common share this represented a 57 increase from the previous level of 1137 per common share paid in 2006 the increase was due to the board’s authorization to pay quarterly dividends in the amount of 31 per common share beginning in september 2007 this increase is consistent with our current plan to maintain our dividend payout ratio between 40 and 50 of reported net earnings 

 

 

in december 2007 the company issued 750 million of fiveyear 5125 fixed rate us dollar notes using the proceeds from these notes to replace a portion of our us commercial paper these notes were issued under an existing shelf registration statement the effective interest rate on these notes reflecting issuance discount and swap settlement is 512 the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and our restricted subsidiaries as defined to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions as well as a change in control provision also in december we redeemed approximately 72 million of notes issued in march 2001 otherwise due in 2011 

 

 

during november 2005 subsidiaries of the company issued approximately 930 million of foreign currencydenominated debt in offerings outside of the united states consisting of euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 the “euro notes” and approximately c330 million of canadian commercial paper these debt issuances were guaranteed by the company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the american jobs creation act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company as well as for general corporate purposes 

 

 

to utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs on february 28 2007 we redeemed the euro notes otherwise due may 2007 for 728 million to partially refinance this redemption we established a program to issue eurocommercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies the notes may have maturities ranging up to 364 days and are senior unsecured obligations of the applicable issuer with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by the company 

 

 

in connection with these financing activities we increased our shortterm lines of credit from 22 billion at december 30 2006 to approximately 26 billion at december 29 2007 this increase was 

achieved via a 400 million unsecured 364day credit agreement effective january 31 2007 the 364day agreement contains customary covenants warranties and restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing 20 billion fiveyear credit agreement which expires in 2011 our credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backup although we do not currently anticipate any drawdown of the facilities refer to note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt issuances and credit facilities the 400 million credit agreement expired at the end of january 2008 and the company did not renew it 

 

 

at december 29 2007 our total debt was approximately 52 billion approximately even with the balance at yearend 2006 during 2006 we reduced the company’s common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4 and implemented a midyear increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 5 similarly during 2007 we further reduced our common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 3 and implemented a midyear increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 65 primarily due to the prioritization of these uses of cash flow the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity as well as pursue selective acquisition opportunities we did not reduce our total debt balance during the past two years but remain committed to net debt reduction total debt less cash over the long term we currently expect the total debt balance at yearend 2008 to be slightly higher than the 2007 yearend level 

 

 

although we presently observe a general recovery of liquidity within the commercial paper market and improved pricing in the corporate bond market we cannot reasonably predict the extent and duration of the continuing subprime mortgage market crisis the economic environment nor their potential indirect effect on our sector however we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected bolton acquisitions through our strong cash flow our program of issuing shortterm debt and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis our significant longterm debt issues do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit our access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our aforementioned credit facilities in addition assuming continuation of the present market conditions we believe it would be possible to term out certain shortterm maturities or obtain additional credit facilities such that the company could further extend its ability to meet its longterm borrowing obligations through 2008 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and other obligations 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 29 2007 the company did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 30 2006 our off balance sheet arrangements were limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately 13 million and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of dsd route franchises up to 17 million during 2007 we terminated the operating lease and purchased the facility see note 6 within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information additionally during 2007 we completed a program to reorganize the dsd operations resulting in the exiting of the route franchise agreements see note 3 within the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

 

contractual obligations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

at the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin no 48 which affects our process for estimating tax benefits and liabilities as further discussed in the “ income taxes ” section beginning on page 27 the initial application of fin no 48 resulted in a net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately 2 million with an offsetting increase to retained earnings refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on fin no 48 

 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” in order to establish a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is intended to result in increased consistency and comparability in fair value measurements sfas no 157 also expands disclosures about fair value measurements with the intention of improving the quality of information provided to users of financial statements the standard applies whenever other authoritative literature requires or permits certain assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value sfas no 157 was originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted in early 2008 the fasb issued staff position fsp fas1572 which delays by one year the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the delay pertains to items including but not limited to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of evaluating goodwill for impairment under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” indefinitelived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment under sfas no 142 and longlived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we plan to adopt the portion of sfas no 157 that has not been delayed by fsp fas1572 as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year and plan to adopt the balance of its provisions as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year for the company balance sheet items carried at fair value on a recurring basis to which sfas no 157 applies in 2008 consist primarily of derivative financial instruments balance sheet items carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to which sfas no 157 will apply in 2009 consist of assets held for sale and exit liabilities relevant to the “ intangibles ” section beginning on page 23 we also use fair value concepts to test various longlived assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas no 157 in 2008 to have a material effect on the measurement of the company’s financial 

assets and liabilities we are continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the determination of fair value related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in post2008 years 

 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 these new standards represent the completion of the fasb’s first major joint project with the international accounting standards board iasb and are intended to improve simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests formerly minority interests in consolidated financial statements we will adopt these standards at the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year the effect of adoption will generally be prospectively applied to transactions completed after the end of our 2008 fiscal year although the new presentation and disclosure requirements for preexisting noncontrolling interests will be retrospectively applied to all priorperiod financial information presented 

 

 

sfas no 141r retains the underlying fair value concepts of its predecessor sfas no 141 but changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a number of significant respects including the requirement to expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as incurred rather than including these amounts in the allocated purchase price the requirement to recognize the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date rather than the expected amount when the contingency is resolved the requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired inprocess research and development assets at the acquisition date rather than immediately expensing and the requirement to recognize a gain in relation to a bargain purchase price rather than reducing the allocated basis of longlived assets because this standard is generally applied prospectively the effect of adoption on our financial statements will depend primarily on specific transactions if any completed after 2008 we are currently evaluating the effects that sfas no 141r is likely to have on potential post2008 transactions 

 

 

under sfas no 160 consolidated financial statements will be presented as if the parent company investors controlling interests and other minority investors noncontrolling interests in partiallyowned subsidiaries have similar economic interests in a single entity as a result the investment in the noncontrolling interest previously recorded on the balance sheet between liabilities and equity the “mezzanine” will be reported as equity in the parent company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 160 furthermore consolidated financial statements will include 100 of a controlled subsidiary’s earnings rather than only the parent company’s share lastly transactions between the parent company and noncontrolling interests will be reported in equity as transactions between shareholders provided these transactions do not create a change in control previously acquisitions of additional interests in a controlled subsidiary generally resulted in remeasurement of assets and liabilities acquired dispositions of interests generally resulted in a gain or loss 

 

 

management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 160 on the company’s financial statements presently there are no significant noncontrolling interests in any of the company’s consolidated subsidiaries therefore we currently believe that the impact of sfas no 160 if any will primarily depend on the materiality of noncontrolling interests arising in future transactions including those entered into during 2008 to which the financial statement presentation and disclosure provisions of sfas no 160 will apply 

 

 

our critical accounting estimates which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements are discussed in the following sections on pages 2327 

 

 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve instore displays and events feature price discounts on our products consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs and similar activities the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 4 004 of our company’s net sales however as our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented nearly 30 of 2007 net sales the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

 

intangibles 

we follow sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in evaluating impairment of intangibles we perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process under sfas no 142 goodwill impairment testing first 

requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction similarly impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables 

 

 

we also follow sfas no 142 in evaluating the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

 

 

at december 29 2007 intangible assets net were 50 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company within this total approximately 14 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler trademarks while we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our north american snacks business or the weightedaverage cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses andor amortization expense 

 

 

stock compensation 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period we adopted sfas no 123r as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year using the modified prospective method accordingly prior years were not restated with the adoption of this pronouncement stockbased compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the company which is further described in note 1 within notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

 

in 2006 our adoption of sfas no 123r resulted in an increase in the company’s corporate sga expense and a corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share due primarily to the recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants no such expense was recognized under our previous accounting method in pre2006 periods however we were required to disclose pro forma results under the alternative fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” using reported results for 2006 and pro forma results for 2005 the comparable impact of stock compensation expense is presented in the following table 

 

 

 

 

accounting for stock compensation under sfas no 123r represents a critical accounting estimate which requires significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements due to the need to determine the grantdate fair value of equity instruments that have not yet been awarded the actual impact on future results will depend in part on actual awards during any reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair value of those awards additionally while the timing and volume of grants associated with a particular year’s longterm incentive compensation are within our control the timing and volume of “reload” option grants are not reload options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to replace previouslyowned company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise price including related employment taxes of vested pre2004 option awards containing this accelerated ownership feature under sfas no 123r these reload options result in additional compensation expense in the year of grant and for 2007 and 2006 represented approximately onethird of the company’s total stock option expense 

the company has not granted options containing an accelerated ownership feature since 2003 however the potential requirement to award reload options over the contractual 10year term of the original grants could continue to significantly impact the amount of our stockbased compensation expense for a number of years 

 

 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model for annual grants and a blackscholes model for reload grants these models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior and dividend yield our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in note 8 within notes to consolidated financial statements in particular our estimate of stock price volatility is based principally on historical volatility of the options granted and to a lesser extent on implied volatilities from traded options on the company’s stock for the latticebased model historical volatility corresponds to the 10year contractual term of the options granted whereas for the blackscholes model historical volatility corresponds to the expected term which is currently 225 years we decided to rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater availability of data and reliability of trends over longer periods of time as compared to the terms of more thinlytraded options which rarely extend beyond two years at yearend 2007 historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged from approximately 22 for 10 years to 11 for 225 years while implied volatilities averaged approximately 20 for traded options with terms in excess of six months based on this data our weightedaverage composite volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants during 2007 was 175 as compared to 179 for 2006 all other assumptions held constant a one percentage point increase or decrease in our 2007 volatility assumption would increase or decrease the grantdate fair value of our 2007 option awards by approximately 4 

 

 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore as historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

 

 

sfas no 123r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or ve sting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a “windfall tax benefit” will be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow if this standard had been adopted in 2005 operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by approximately 20 million as a result of this provision for 2007 and 2006 the corresponding reduction in operating cash flow attributable to windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow was 15 million and 22 million respectively the actual impact on future years’ operating cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

 

 

for balance sheet classification purposes realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within the consolidated balance sheet realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate under the transition rules for adopting sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method we were permitted to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post1995 years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits we completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that 2008 earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we follow sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits 

provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees’ active working life inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

 

 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 70 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 27 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2007 of 89 equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of our 2007 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 30 of our global benefit plan assets 

 

 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 29 2007 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2008 benefits expense by approximately 44 million correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2008 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 13 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2008 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 1 million in 2009 increasing to approximately 7 million in 2013 for each of the three fiscal years our actual return on plan assets exceededwas less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2007–99 2006–257 2005–39 

 

 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 6 our initial trend rate for 2008 of 85 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 1 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 475 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 29 2007 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2008 benefits expense by approximately 16 million a 100 basis point excess of 2008 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 9 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 106 the net experience gain arising from recognition of 2007 claims experience was approximately 6 million 

 

 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index ® for our us plans to test the appropriateness of these indices we periodically conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities consisting principally of aarated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions noncallable issues with at least 25 million principal outstanding the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to 

pay benefits as they become due for those years where no suitable bonds are available the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years as of three different interim dates during 2007 and four different dates during 2006 this matching exercise for our us plans produced a discount rate within  20 basis points of the equivalentdated citigroup pension liability index ®  the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our company’s fiscal year end thus we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year based on consolidated obligations at december 29 2007 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2008 benefits expense by approximately 15 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

 

 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of december 29 2007 we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 6 billion as compared to approximately 9 billion at december 30 2006 the yearoveryear decline in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of rising discount rates on our benefit obligations of the total unamortized amounts at december 29 2007 approximately 50 was related to discount rate reductions prior to 2007 with the remainder primarily related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate for 2008 we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately 41 million lower than the actual 2007 amount of approximately 99 million as discussed on page 14 total employee benefits expense for 2008 is expected to be slightly lower than the 2007 amount due to increases in the discount rate environment and the ongoing phase in of favorable asset returns 

 

 

assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would decrease versus the 2008 amount 

 

 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense we establish tax reserves in accordance with fin no 48 which we adopted at the beginning of 2007 fin no 48 is based on a benefit recognition model which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances prior to the adoption of fin no 48 our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution the initial application of fin no 48 resulted in a net decrease to the company’s consolidated accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately 2 million with an offsetting increase to retained earnings 

 

 

the company evaluates a tax position in twosteps in accordance with fin no 48 the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythan not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position in weighing the technical merits of the position we consider the facts and circumstances of the position we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the morelikelythan not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements while reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes the company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer morelikelythan not of being sustained 

 

 

for the periods presented our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately 170 million reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1 of earnings before income taxes annually significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 

the current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities likewise the current portion of related interest reserves are presented in the balance sheet within accrued other liabilities with the amount expected to be settled after one year recorded in other noncurrent liabilities 

 

 

 

future outlook 

 

 

our 2008 forecasted consolidated results are generally based on our longterm annual growth targets as discussed on page 12 although we currently expect our internal net sales could increase at a midsingle digit rate slightly exceeding our low singledigit growth target we expect this higherthantargeted growth to come principally from previously announced pricing initiatives improved product mix and continued innovation despite a projected decline in gross margin of approximately 100 basis points which is being negatively impacted by 40 basis points due to acquisitions and 30 basis points due to upfront costs recorded in cost of goods sold we believe the higherthantargeted sales growth will support mid singledigit consolidated operating profit growth as discussed on page 17 net interest expense for 2008 is expected to be comparable to 2007 expense and our consolidated effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31 finally as discussed in more detail on page 34 our fiscal year 2008 will benefit from a 53rd week the benefit associated with this extra week will be largely invested in emerging markets and various acquisitions in the united states these factors are expected to provide the growth necessary to achieve our target of high singledigit growth in 2008 net earnings per share in addition we remain committed to reinvesting in brand building costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities lastly we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2008 cash flow to be approximately even with our 2007 results

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 

 

 

foreign exchange risk 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to thirdparty purchases intercompany loans and product shipments our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

 

 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2007 was 570 million representing a settlement obligation of 86 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2006 was 455 million representing a settlement obligation of 1 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 57 million at yearend 2007 and 46 million at yearend 2006 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

 

 

interest rate risk 

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

 

 

note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on our significant debt issues there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at yearend 2007 and 2006 assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 19 million in 2007 and 20 million in 2006 

 

 

price risk 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa paperboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 

18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled 188 million as of december 29 2007 and equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs at yearend 2006 the notional amount was 209 million 

 

 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2007 including the natural gas swaps was 229 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 22 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement receivable would decrease by approximately 22 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2006 including the natural gas swaps was 239 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 11 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices this settlement obligation would increase by approximately 17 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 

 

 

in addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure it should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company

securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans 

 

 

 

 

five plans including one individual compensation arrangement are considered “equity compensation plans not approved by security holders” the kellogg share incentive plan which was adopted in 2002 and is available to most uk employees of specified kellogg company subsidiaries a similar plan which is available to employees in the republic of ireland the kellogg company executive stock purchase plan which was adopted in 2002 and is available to selected senior level kellogg employees the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors which was adopted in 1986 and amended in 1993 and 2002 and a nonqualified stock option granted in 2000 to mr jenness when he had just been appointed a kellogg director 

 

under the kellogg share incentive plan eligible uk employees may contribute up to 1500 pounds sterling annually to the plan through payroll deductions the trustees of the plan use those contributions to buy shares of our common stock at fair market value on the open market with kellogg matching those contributions on a 11 basis shares must be withdrawn from the plan when employees cease employment under current law eligible employees generally receive certain income and other tax benefits if those shares are held in the plan for a specified number of years a similar plan is also available to employees in the republic of ireland as these plans are open market plans with no set overall maximum no amounts for these plans are included in the above table however approximately 75000 shares were purchased by eligible employees under the kellogg share incentive plan the plan for the republic of ireland and other similar predecessor plans during 2007 with approximately an additional 75000 shares being provided as matched shares 

 

 

under the kellogg company executive stock purchase plan selected senior level kellogg employees may elect to use all or part of their annual bonus on an aftertax basis to purchase shares of our common stock at fair market value as determined over a thirtyday trading period no more than 500000 treasury shares are authorized for use under this plan 

 

 

under the deferred compensation plan for nonemployee directors nonemployee directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation other than expense reimbursement into units which are credited to their accounts the units have a value equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the appropriate date with dividend equivalents being earned on the whole units in nonemployee directors’ accounts units may be paid in either cash or shares of our common stock either in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments with the payments to begin as soon as practicable after the nonemployee director’s service as a director terminates no more than 150000 shares are authorized for use under this plan of which approximately 11000 had been issued as of december 29 2007 because directors may elect and are likely to elect a distribution of cash rather than shares the contingently issuable shares are not included in column a of the table above 

 

 

when mr jenness joined kellogg as a director in 2000 he was granted a nonqualified stock option to purchase 300000 shares of our common stock in connection with this option which was to vest over three annual installments he agreed to devote 50 of his working time to consulting with kellogg with further vesting to immediately stop if he was no longer willing to devote such amount of time to consulting with kellogg or if kellogg decided that it no longer wishes to receive such services during 2001 kellogg 

and mr jenness agreed to terminate the consulting relationship which immediately terminated the unvested 200000 shares this option contains the aof feature described in the proxy statement

raw materials agricultural commodities are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us world supplies and prices of such commodities which include such packaging materials are constantly monitored as are government trade policies the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our shortterm and longterm requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

 

our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies 

 

our results in the past have been and in the future may continue to be materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business the financial markets through which we access capital and currency political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business 

 

the enactment of or increases in tariffs including value added tax or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations 

 

we operate in the highly competitive food industry 

 

we face competition across our product lines including readytoeat cereals and convenience foods from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and 

product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase capital marketing or other expenditures or lose category share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products 

 

our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes 

 

there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products 

 

our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research development and technology process functions of our business we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

 

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

 

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

 

as of december 30 2006 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 487 billion of which 345 billion was goodwill and 142 billion represented trademarks tradenames and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 1071 billion and shareholders’ equity of 207 billion 

 

we may not achieve our targeted cost savings from cost reduction initiatives 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 

 

we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders’ equity as of december 30 2006 we had total debt of approximately 504 billion and shareholders’ equity of 207 billion 

 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject 

to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on shortterm financing and to financial business and other factors beyond our control 

 

our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in our products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition 

 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial conditions 

 

additionally our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations our major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate or trend of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

 

we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits 

 

our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 18 of consolidated net sales during 2006 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 30 2006 approximately 14 of our consolidated receivables balance and 22 of our us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates during 2006 our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 33 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 42 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to use our scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits 

 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

 

we consider our intellectual property rights including particularly and most notably our trademarks but also including patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products 

any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 

 

our activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union and various state provincial and local governments as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies various state and local agencies also regulate our activities 

 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products is subject to governmental regulation that is becoming increasingly onerous those regulations control such matters as ingredients advertising relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure which could negatively impact our operating results 

 

we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency to the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately our consolidated results of operations may be negatively affected 

 

if our food products become adulterated or misbranded we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

 

we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

kellogg company is the world’s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods including cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks frozen waffles and veggie foods kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe latin america and asia pacific for the periods presented the asia pacific operating segment included australia and asian markets beginning in 2007 this segment will also include south africa which was formerly a part of europe 

 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets during the periods presented these targets were low singledigit for internal net sales mid singledigit for internal operating profit and high singledigit for net earnings per share which we met or exceeded in each of 2004 2005 and 2006 

 

 

 

  

in combination with an attractive dividend yield we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders we plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business expanding our snacks business and pursuing selected growth opportunities we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profitrich sustainable sales growth as well as cash flow and return on invested capital we believe our steady earnings growth strong cash flow and continued investment during a multiyear period of significant commodity and energydriven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model 

 

net sales and operating profit 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2006 versus 2005 

 

 

 

 

 

  

during 2006 our consolidated net sales increased 7 with strong results in both north america and the total of our international segments internal net sales also grew 7 building on a 6 rate of internal growth during 2005 successful innovation brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion investment and instore execution continued to drive broadbased sales growth across each 

of our enterprisewide product groups in fact we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating segments 

 

for 2006 our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of 8 internal net sales growth was also 8 with each major product group contributing as follows retail cereal 3 retail snacks cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars fruit snacks 11 frozen and specialty food service vending convenience drug stores custom manufacturing channels 8 the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business represented nearly onehalf of the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for 2006 the 2006 growth in north america retail cereal sales was on top of 8 growth in 2005 and represented the 6th consecutive year in which we’ve increased our dollar share of category sales although north america consumer retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout 2006 our shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of 2006 by approximately 2 versus the prioryear period we believe this decline was largely attributable to yearend retail trade inventory adjustments which brought inventories in line with yearend 2005 levels after several successive quarters of slight inclines 

 

our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately 6 or 5 on an internal basis with leading dollar contributions from our uk france mexico and venezuela business units internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents less than 5 of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year as solid growth in australia cereal and asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australia snack business 

 

consolidated operating profit for 2006 grew 1 with internal operating profit up 4 versus 2005 as discussed on page 11 our measure of internal operating profit growth is consistent with our measure of internal sales growth except that during 2006 internal operating profit growth also excluded the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated with our adoption of sfas no 123r we used this nongaap financial measure during our first year of adopting this fasb standard in order to assist management and investors in assessing the company’s financial operating performance against comparative periods which did not include stock optionrelated compensation expense accordingly corporate selling general and administrative sga expense was higher and operating profit was lower by 654 million for 2006 reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately four percentage points refer to the section beginning on page 21 entitled “ stock compensation ” for further information on the company’s adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

as further discussed beginning on page 14 our measure of internal operating profit growth includes upfront costs related to costreduction initiatives although total 2006 upfront costs of 82 million were not significantly changed from the 2005 amount of 90 million a yearoveryear shift in operating segment allocation of such costs affected relative segment performance the 2006 versus 2005 change in project cost allocation was a 44 million decline in north america improving 2006 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4 and a 28 million increase in europe reducing 2006 segment operating profit performance by approximately 8 

 

our currentyear operating profit growth was affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the “ margin performance ” section beginning on page 13 expenditures for brandbuilding activities increased at a low singledigit rate this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns within our total brandbuilding metric advertising expenditures grew at a high singledigit rate for 2006 which is a dynamic that we expect to continue through 2007 due to a relatively heavier focus on promotional efficiencies consistent with our longterm commitment we expect to return to higher rates of growth for total brandbuilding expenditures beginning in 2008 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2005 versus 2004 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

during 2005 consolidated net sales increased nearly 6 internal net sales also grew approximately 6 which was on top of 5 internal sales growth in 2004 

 

for 2005 successful innovation and brandbuilding investment drove strong growth across our north american business units which collectively reported a 7 increase in net sales versus 2004 internal net sales of our north america retail cereal business increased 8 with strong performance in both the united states and canada internal net sales of our north america retail snacks business increased 7 on top of 8 growth in 2004 this growth was attributable principally to sales of fruit snacks toaster pastries cracker products and major cookie brands partially offsetting this growth was the impact of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie innovations internal net sales of our north america frozen and specialty channel businesses collectively increased approximately 8 led by solid contributions from our eggo ® frozen foods and food service businesses 

 

in 2005 our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of nearly 4 on both a reported and internal basis with our latin america operating segment contributing approximately twothirds of the total dollar increase nevertheless we achieved our longterm annual growth targets of low singledigit for internal net sales in our europe and asia pacific operating segments due primarily to solid innovation performance in southern europe and asia 

 

consolidated operating profit increased 4 during 2005 with our europe operating segment contributing approximately onehalf of the total dollar increase this disproportionate contribution was attributable to a yearoveryear shift in segment allocation of charges from costreduction initiatives as discussed in the section beginning on page 14 the 2005 versus 2004 change in project cost allocation was a 65 million decline in europe improving 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 22 and a 46 million increase in north america reducing 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4 

 

internal growth in consolidated operating profit was 5 this internal growth was achieved despitedouble digit growth in brandbuilding and innovation expenditures and significant cost pressures on gross margin as discussed in the following section during 2005 we increased our consolidated brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion expenditures by more than 1 1  2 times the rate of sales growth 

 

corporate operating profit for 2004 included a charge of 95 million related to ceo transition expenses which arose from the departure of carlos gutierrez the company’s former ceo related to his appointment as us secretary of commerce in early 2005 the total charge net of forfeitures of 95 million was comprised principally of 37 million for special pension termination benefits and 55 million for accelerated vesting of 606250 stock options segment operating profit for 2004 included intangibles impairment losses of 104 million comprised of 79 million to write off the carrying value of a contractbased intangible asset in north america and 25 million to write off goodwill in latin america 

 

margin performance 

 

margin performance is presented in the following table 

 

 

 

  

we strive for gross margin expansion to reinvest in brandbuilding and innovation expenditures our strategy for expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements productivity savings and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging 

 

our gross margin performance for 2005 and 2006 reflects the impact of significant fuel energy and commodity price inflation experienced throughout most of that time as well as increased employee benefit costs in the aggregate these input cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin by approximately 150 basis points for 2006 and 60 basis points in 2005 for 2006 our gross margin performance was also unfavorably impacted by incremental logistics and 

innovation startup costs related to the recent significant sales growth within our north america operating segment 

 

while the majority of the inflationary pressure during 2005 and 2006 was commodity and energydriven employee benefit costs the majority of which are recorded in cost of goods sold also increased during that time period with total active and retired employee benefits expense reaching approximately 325 million in 2006 versus 290 million in 2005 and 260 million in 2004 for 2007 the combined effect of favorable trust asset performance and rising interest rates is expected to have a moderating effect on underlying health care cost inflation as a result we expect 2007 benefits expense to be approximately even with the 2006 amount 

 

for 2007 we expect this inflationary trend to continue with input cost fuel energy commodity and benefits pressures forecasted to exceed realized savings as compared to 2006 results we currently expect 110130 million of incremental cost inflation primarily associated with the prices of our 2007 ingredient purchases accordingly we believe our 2007 consolidated gross margin could decline by up to 50 basis points 

 

in addition to external cost pressures our discretionary investment in costreduction initiatives refer to following section has created variability in our gross margin performance during the periods presented although total annual programrelated charges were relatively steady over the past several years the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied by year in millions 2006−74 2005−90 2004−46 additionally cost of goods sold for 2005 includes a charge of approximately 12 million related to a lumpsum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our us cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the company covering the fouryear period ended october 2009 

 

for 2006 both our sga and operating margin were affected by our fiscal 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r during 2006 we reported incremental stock compensation expense of 654 million which increased our sga and reduced our operating margin by approximately 60 basis points refer to the section beginning on page 21 entitled “ stock compensation ” for further information on this subject 

 

costreduction initiatives 

 

we view our continued spending on costreduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to reinvest earnings so as to provide greater reliability in meeting longterm growth targets initiatives undertaken must meet certain payback and internal rate of return irr targets we currently require each project to recover total cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion or to achieve an irr of at least 20 each costreduction initiative is normally one to three years in duration upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multiyear programs the project begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation which is then used to fund new initiatives to implement these programs the company has incurred various upfront costs including asset writeoffs exit charges and other project expenditures which we include in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the “ net sales and operating profit ” section beginning on page 11 

 

in 2006 we commenced a multiyear european manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in manchester england and to better align production in europe based on forecasted foreign exchange rates the company currently expects to incur approximately 60 million in total upfront costs including those already incurred in 2006 comprised of approximately 80 cash and 20 noncash asset writeoffs to complete this initiative the cash portion of the total upfront costs results principally from our plan to eliminate approximately 220 hourly and salaried positions from the manchester facility by the end of 2008 through voluntary early retirement and severance programs for 2006 we incurred approximately 28 million of total upfront costs and expect to incur a similar amount in 2007 leaving a relatively insignificant amount to be incurred in 2008 cash requirements for this initiative are expected to exceed projected cash charges by approximately 10 million in total due to incremental pension trust funding requirements of early retirements most of this incremental funding occurred in 2006 

 

also during 2006 we implemented several shortterm initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our us cereal manufacturing network and streamlined our sales distribution system in a latin american market in 2005 we undertook an initiative to consolidate us snacks bakery capacity resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by mid 2006 major initiatives commenced in 2004 were the global rollout of the sap information technology system reorganization of paneuropean operations consolidation of us veggie foods manufacturing operations and relocation of our us snacks business unit to battle creek michigan except for the aforementioned european manufacturing optimization plan our other initiatives were substantially complete at december 30 2006 details of each initiative are described in note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

for 2006 the company recorded total programrelated charges of approximately 82 million comprised of 20 million of asset writeoffs 30 million for severance and other exit costs 9 million for other cash expenditures 4 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability and 19 million for pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits approximately 74 million of the total 2006 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating segment results with approximately 8 million recorded in sga expense within corporate results the company’s operating segments were impacted as follows in millions north america−46 europe−28 

 

for 2005 total programrelated charges were approximately 90 million comprised of 16 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability 44 million of asset writeoffs 21 million in severance and other exit costs and 9 million for other cash expenditures all of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within our north america operating segment 

 

for 2004 total programrelated charges were approximately 109 million comprised of 41 million in asset writeoffs 1 million for special pension termination benefits 15 million in severance and other exit costs and 52 million in other cash expenditures such as relocation and consulting approximately 46 million of the total 2004 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold with approximately 63 million recorded in sga expense the 2004 charges impacted our operating segments as follows in millions north america−44 europe−65 

 

for the periods presented cash requirements to implement these programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges incurred in each year except for approximately 8 million of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in 2006 in connection with the european manufacturing optimization plan at december 30 2006 the company’s remaining cash commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of 1 exit cost reserves of 14 million expected to be paid out in 2007 2 approximately 25 million of projected spending and pension trust funding during 2007 and 2008 associated with the european manufacturing optimization plan and 3 an estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability of 20 million which will not be finally determined until 2008 and once determined is payable to the pension fund over a 20year maximum period we expect these cash requirements to be funded by operating cash flow 

 

our 2007 earnings target includes total projected charges related to inprogress and potential costreduction initiatives of approximately 80 million or 14 per share approximately onethird of this total is allocated to the european manufacturing optimization plan however the specific cash versus noncash mix or cost of goods sold versus sga expense impact of the remainder has not yet been determined other potential initiatives to be commenced in 2007 are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as we commit to these discretionary investments 

 

interest expense 

 

as illustrated in the following table annual interest expense for the 20042006 period has been relatively steady at approximately 300 million per year which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time interest income recorded in other income has trended upward from approximately 7 million in 2004 to 11 million in 2006 resulting in net interest expense of approximately 296 million for 2006 we currently expect that our 2007 net interest expense will approximate the 2006 level 

 

 

  

other income expense net 

 

other income expense net includes nonoperating items such as interest income charitable donations and foreign exchange gains and losses other income expense net for the periods presented was in millions 2006−132 2005−249 2004−66 the variability in other income expense net among years reflects the timing of certain significant charges explained in the following paragraph and net foreign exchange transaction losses included therein of in millions 2006−2 2005−2 2004−15 

 

other expense includes charges for contributions to the kellogg’s corporate citizenship fund a private trust established for charitable giving as follows in millions 2006−3 2005−16 2004−9 other expense for 2005 also includes a charge of approximately 7 million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value this facility was sold in august 2006 

 

income taxes 

 

our longterm objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 3132 in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our longterm target excluding the impact of discrete adjustments our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for both 2006 and 2005 was approximately 33 which is what we currently expect for 2007 our reported rates of approximately 32 for 2006 and 31 for 2005 were lower due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements statutory rate changes and other deferred tax liability adjustments refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information similarly our 2007 consolidated effective income tax rate could be up to 200 basis points lower than the aforementioned sustainable rate if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more favorably than we currently expect we expect that any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be invested in costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities 

 

the consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 of nearly 35 was higher than the rates for 2006 and 2005 primarily because this period preceded the final reorganization of our european operations which favorably affected the countryweighting impact on our rate refer to note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on this initiative additionally the 2004 consolidated effective income tax rate included a provision of approximately 28 million net of related foreign tax credits for approximately 11 billion of dividends from foreign subsidiaries which we elected to repatriate in 2005 under the american jobs creation act finally 2005 was the first year in which we were permitted to claim a phasedin deduction from us taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified production income “qpi” 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions this cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products our cash conversion cycle is relatively short although receivable collection patterns vary around the world in the united states our days sales outstanding dso averaged approximately 19 days during the periods presented as a result our operating cash flow should generally reflect our net earnings performance over time although as illustrated in the following schedule specific results for any particular year may be significantly affected by the level of benefit plan contributions working capital movements operating assets and liabilities and other factors 

 

 

 

  

our operating cash flow for 2006 was approximately 267 million higher than 2005 due primarily to lower benefit plan contributions partially offset by unfavorable working capital movements correspondingly operating cash flow for 2005 was approximately 86 million lower than 2004 due principally to a significant increase in benefit plan contributions the decline in benefit plan contributions for 2006 reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit plans that was achieved through a significant amount of funding in the 20032005 period 

 

on august 17 2006 the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from taxqualified plans most of these provisions are first applicable to our us defined benefit pension plans in 2008 on a phasedin basis the ppa will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our us plans however due to our historical 

funding practices we currently believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under the new ppa requirements until after 2012 accordingly we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several years with total 2007 us and foreign plan contributions currently estimated at approximately 54 million actual 2007 contributions could exceed our current projections as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements renewals of union contracts or higherthanexpected health care claims experience additionally our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

 

in comparison to 2005 the unfavorable movement in core working capital during 2006 was related to trade payables performance and higher inventory balances at december 30 2006 our consolidated trade payables balance was within 3 of the balance at yearend 2005 in contrast our trade payables balance increased approximately 22 during 2005 from a historicallylow level at the end of 2004 the higher inventory balance was principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent the overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on hand our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably affected by us capacity limitations during 2006 nevertheless our consolidated inventory balances remain at industryleading levels 

 

despite the unfavorable movement in the absolute balance average core working capital continues to improve as a percentage of net sales for the trailing fiftytwo weeks ended december 30 2006 core working capital was 68 of net sales as compared to 70 as of yearend 2005 and 73 as of yearend 2004 we have achieved this multiyear reduction primarily through faster collection of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables up until 2006 we had also been successful in implementing logistics improvements to reduce inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer requirements we believe the opportunity to reduce inventory from yearend 2006 levels could represent a source of operating cash flow during 2007 

 

for 2005 the net favorable movement in core working capital was related to the aforementioned increase in trade payables partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade receivables which returned to historical levels in relation to sales in early 2005 from lower levels at the end of 2004 we believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our 53rd week over the 2004 holiday period which impacted the core working capital component of our operating cash flow throughout 2005 

 

as presented in the table on page 16 other working capital was a source of cash in 2006 versus a use of cash in 2005 the yearoveryear favorable variance of approximately 116 million was attributable to several factors including lower debtrelated currency swap payments in 2006 as well as businessrelated growth in accrued compensation and promotional liabilities the unfavorable movement in other working capital for 2004 as compared to succeeding years primarily relates to a decrease in current income tax liabilities which is offset in the deferred income taxes line item 

 

our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchase our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 

 

 

our 2006 and 2005 cash flow as defined performance reflects increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our company’s strong sales growth over the past several years this increased capital spending represented 42 of net sales in 2006 and 37 of net sales in 2005 as compared to 29 in 2004 for 2007 we currently expect property expenditures to remain at approximately 4 of net sales which is consistent with our longterm target for capital spending this forecast includes expenditures associated with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in ontario canada which represents approximately 15 of our 2007 capital plan this facility is being constructed to satisfy existing capacity needs in our north america business which we believe will partially ease certain of the aforementioned logistics and inventory management issues which we encountered during 2006 

 

for 2007 we are targeting cash flow of 9501025 million we expect to achieve our target principally through operating 

profit growth which is forecasted to offset higher levels of capital spending and income tax payments during 2007 

 

in order to support the continued growth of our north american fruit snacks business we completed two separate business acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately 50 million in cash including related transaction costs in june 2005 we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from kraft foods inc the facility is located in chicago illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly and salaried employees in november 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a washington statebased manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks 

 

for 2006 our board of directors authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to 650 million which we spent to repurchase approximately 149 million shares this activity consisted principally of a february 2006 private transaction with the wk kellogg foundation trust “the trust” to repurchase approximately 128 million shares for 550 million pursuant to similar board authorizations applicable to those years we paid 664 million in 2005 to repurchase approximately 154 million shares and 298 million in 2004 for approximately 73 million shares the 2005 activity consisted principally of a november 2005 private transaction with the trust to repurchase approximately 94 million shares for 400 million for 2007 our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 650 million 

 

in july 2005 we redeemed 7234 million of longterm debt representing the remaining principal balance of our 60 us dollar notes due april 2006 in october 2005 we repaid 200 million of maturing 4875 us dollar notes in december 2005 we redeemed 354 million of us dollar notes due june 2008 these payments were funded principally through issuance of us dollar shortterm debt 

 

during november 2005 subsidiaries of the company issued approximately 930 million of foreign currencydenominated debt in offerings outside of the united states consisting of euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 the “euro notes” and approximately c330 million of canadian commercial paper these debt issuances were guaranteed by the company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the american jobs creation act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company as well as for general corporate purposes 

 

to utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs on january 31 2007 we announced an early redemption of the euro notes effective february 28 2007 to partially refinance this redemption we established a program to issue eurocommercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies the notes may have maturities ranging up to 364 days and will be senior unsecured obligations of the applicable issuer with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by the company in connection with these financing activities we increased our shortterm lines of credit from 22 billion at december 30 2006 to approximately 26 billion via a 400 million unsecured 364day credit agreement effective january 31 2007 the 364day agreement contains customary covenants warranties and restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing 20 billion fiveyear credit agreement which expires in 2011 these facilities are available for general corporate purposes including commercial paper backup although the company does not currently anticipate any usage under the facilities refer to note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt issuances and credit facilities 

 

at december 30 2006 our total debt was approximately 50 billion approximately even with the balances at yearend 2005 and 2004 during 2005 we increased our benefit trust investments through plan funding by approximately 13 reduced the company’s common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4 and implemented a midyear increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 10 similarly during 2006 we further reduced our common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4 and implemented a midyear increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 5 primarily due to the prioritization of these uses of cash flow plus the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity we did not reduce our total debt balance during the past two years but remain committed to net debt reduction total debt less cash over the long term we currently expect the total debt balance at yearend 2007 to be slightly higher than the 2006 yearend level 

 

we believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities through our strong cash flow our program of issuing shortterm debt and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis our significant longterm debt issues do not 

contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit its access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our credit facilities which are in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding commercial paper balance which was 13 billion at december 30 2006 in addition assuming continuation of market liquidity we believe it would be possible to term out certain shortterm maturities or obtain additional credit facilities such that the company could further extend its ability to meet its longterm borrowing obligations through 2008 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and other obligations 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately 13 million which will expire in july 2007 and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of dsd route franchises up to 17 million we record the estimated fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet which was insignificant for the periods presented refer to note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

contractual obligations

critical accounting policies and 

significant accounting estimates 

 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements during 2006 we adopted two new accounting pronouncements which had a significant impact on our company’s financial statements at the beginning of 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which materially reduced our fiscal 2006 results due primarily to the firsttime recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants this topic is further discussed in the section beginning on page 21 

 

secondly at the end of 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” which required us to reflect the net over or underfunded position of our defined postretirement and postemployment benefit plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet with unrecognized prior service cost and net experience losses recorded in shareholders’ equity under preexisting guidance these unrecognized amounts which totaled approximately 8908 million at december 30 2006 were disclosed only in financial statement footnotes accordingly the aftertax presentation of these amounts on the balance sheet reduced consolidated net assets and shareholders’ equity by 5919 million at yearend 2006 nevertheless we do not believe this impact is economically significant because our net earnings cash flow liquidity debt covenants and plan funding requirements were not affected by this change in accounting principle refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on sfas no 158 refer to the section beginning on page 22 for information on our process for estimating benefit obligations 

 

at the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income 

taxes” fin no 48 which affects our process for estimating tax benefits and liabilities as further discussed in the “ income taxes ” section beginning on page 24 the initial application of fin no 48 resulted in a net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately 2 million with an offsetting increase to retained earnings refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on fin no 48 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” to provide enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also expands disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value how fair value is determined and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings the standard applies whenever other authoritative literature requires or permits certain assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted we plan to adopt sfas no 157 in the first quarter of our 2008 fiscal year for the company balance sheet items carried at fair value consist primarily of derivatives and other financial instruments assets held for sale exit liabilities and the trust asset component of net benefit plan obligations relevant to the “ intangibles ” section beginning on this page we also use fair value concepts to test various longlived assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on how these assets and liabilities are currently measured 

 

our critical accounting estimates which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements are discussed in the following sections on pages 2025 

 

promotional expenditures 

 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve instore displays and events feature price discounts on our products consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs and similar activities the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented in excess of 4 004 of our company’s net sales however as our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented nearly 30 of 2006 net sales the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

intangibles 

 

we follow sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in evaluating impairment of intangibles we perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process under sfas no 142 goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction similarly impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables we periodically engage thirdparty valuation consultants to assist in this process 

 

we also follow sfas no 142 in evaluating the useful life over which a nongoodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in 

distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

 

at december 30 2006 intangible assets net were 49 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company within this total approximately 14 billion of nongoodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinitelived comprised principally of keebler trademarks while we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our north american snacks business or the weightedaverage cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses andor amortization expense 

 

stock compensation 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period we adopted sfas no 123r as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year using the modified prospective method accordingly prior years were not restated but our 2006 results include compensation expense associated with unvested equitybased awards which were granted prior to 2006 with the adoption of this pronouncement stockbased compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the company which is further described in note 1 within notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

for 2006 our adoption of sfas no 123r has resulted in an increase in the company’s corporate sga expense and a corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants no such expense was recognized under our previous accounting method in pre2006 periods however we were required to disclose pro forma results under the alternate fair value method prescribed by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” using reported results for 2006 and pro forma results for 2005 the comparable impact of stock compensation expense is presented in the following table 

 

 

 

as illustrated in the preceding table the pro forma incremental impact of stock compensation was 09 per share for 2005 versus an 11 impact of adopting sfas no 123r in 2006 the 02 yearoveryear increase in the pershare impact is due principally to an increase in the number of options granted during 2006 and a lower average number of shares outstanding on which the calculation is based as explained in the following paragraphs the amount of stock compensation recognized for any particular year is highly dependent on market conditions and other factors outside of our control based on historical patterns and predicted market conditions existing at december 30 2006 we currently expect the 2007 earnings per share impact of stock option expense to be within the range of actual 2005 and 2006 results 

 

accounting for stock compensation under sfas no 123r represents a critical accounting estimate which requires significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements due to the need to determine the grantdate fair value of equity instruments that have not yet been awarded the actual impact on future results will depend in part on actual awards during any reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair value of those awards additionally while the timing and volume of grants associated with a particular year’s longterm incentive compensation are within our control the timing and volume of “reload” option grants are not reload options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to replace previouslyowned company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise price including related employment taxes of vested pre2004 option awards containing this accelerated ownership feature under sfas no 123r these reload options result in additional compensation expense in the year of grant and for 2006 represented approximately onethird of the company’s total stock option expense the 

company has not granted options containing an accelerated ownership feature since 2003 however the potential requirement to award reload options over the contractual 10year term of the original grants could continue to significantly impact the amount of our stockbased compensation expense for a number of years 

 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model for annual grants and a blackscholes model for reload grants these models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility employee exercise behavior and dividend yield our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in note 8 within notes to consolidated financial statements in particular our estimate of stock price volatility is based principally on historical volatility of the options granted and to a lesser extent on implied volatilities from traded options on the company’s stock for the latticebased model historical volatility corresponds to the 10year contractual term of the options granted whereas for the blackscholes model historical volatility corresponds to the expected term which is currently 25 years we decided to rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater availability of data and reliability of trends over longer periods of time as compared to the terms of more thinlytraded options which rarely extend beyond two years at yearend 2006 historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged from approximately 23 for 10 years to 12 for 25 years in comparison implied volatilities averaged approximately 16 for traded options with terms in excess of six months based on this data our weightedaverage composite volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants during 2006 was 179 as compared to 220 for 2005 all other assumptions held constant a one percentage point increase or decrease in our 2006 volatility assumption would increase or decrease the grantdate fair value of our 2006 option awards by approximately 4 

 

to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions we are not required to true up grantdate fair valuebased expense to final intrinsic values however these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options as explained in the following two paragraphs furthermore as historical data has a significant bearing on our forwardlooking assumptions significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions which could then significantly impact the yearoveryear comparability of stockbased compensation expense 

 

sfas no 123r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a “windfall tax benefit” will be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow if this standard had been adopted in 2005 operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by approximately 20 million as a result of this provision for 2006 the corresponding reduction in operating cash flow attributable to windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow was 215 million the actual impact on future years’ operating cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 

 

for balance sheet classification purposes realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within the consolidated balance sheet realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits if any and then charged directly to income tax expense potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate under the transition rules for adopting sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method we were permitted to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post1995 years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits we completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls such that 2007 earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this provision however as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

 

retirement benefits 

 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we follow sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” as amended by sfas no 158 effective as of our fiscal yearend 2006 for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans embodied in both of these standards is 

the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees’ active working life inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we work with thirdparty financial consultants to model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 70 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 28 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2006 of 89 equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of our 2006 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign trust investments represent approximately 30 of our global benefit plan assets 

 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 30 2006 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately 42 million correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2007 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 13 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2007 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 1 million in 2008 increasing to approximately 7 million in 2012 for each of the three years ending december 30 2006 our actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2006−2571 2005−394 2004−956 

 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we work with thirdparty financial consultants to model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 8 our initial trend rate for 2007 of 95 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 1 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 475 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 30 2006 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately 18 million a 100 basis point excess of 2007 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 9 million any arising health care claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over 15 years resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 106 the net experience gain arising from recognition of 2006 claims experience was approximately 6 million 

 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index ® for our us plans to test the appropriateness of these indices we periodically engage thirdparty financial consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities consisting principally of aarated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions noncallable issues with at least 25 million principal outstanding the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due for those years where no suitable bonds are available the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years as of four different interim dates during 2005 and 2006 this matching exercise for our us plans produced a discount rate within − 15 basis points of the equivalentdated citigroup pension liability index ®  the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our company’s fiscal year end thus we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year based on consolidated obligations at december 30 2006 a 25 basis point decline in the weightedaverage discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately 17 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

 

despite the previouslydescribed rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of december 30 2006 we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 9 billion as compared to approximately 14 billion at december 31 2005 the yearoveryear decline in net unamortized amounts was attributable largely to trust asset performance and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on our benefit obligations of the total unamortized amounts at december 30 2006 approximately 80 was related to discount rate reductions with the remainder primarily related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate for 2007 we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately 25 million lower than the actual 2006 amount of approximately 123 million as discussed on page 14 total employee benefits expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately even with the 2006 amount with higher active health care claims cost and postretirement service and interest cost components offsetting the lower amortization expense 

 

assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would remain approximately level with the 2007 amount 

 

income taxes 

 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate for the periods presented our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately 150 million reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1 of earnings before income taxes annually nevertheless the accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments throughout a particular year has historically impacted our consolidated effective income tax rate by up to 200 basis points as discussed on page 16 for 2007 we believe our rate could be up to 200 basis points lower if pending uncertain tax matters including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives are resolved more favorably than we currently expect 

 

for the periods presented our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution as compared to a contingency approach fin no 48 which we adopted at the beginning of 2007 is 

based on a benefit recognition model which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained fin no 48 permits a company to recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement the tax position must be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained despite this difference in conceptual approach we do not currently expect the adoption of fin no 48 to have a significant impact on the amount of benefits recognized in connection with our uncertain tax positions during 2007 the current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

future outlook 

 

our 2007 forecasted consolidated results are generally based on our longterm annual growth targets as discussed on page 11 although we currently expect our internal net sales could increase as much as four percent slightly exceeding our low singledigit growth target we expect this higherthantargeted growth to come principally from continued category expansion in latin america and strong innovation performance in north america despite a projected decline in gross margin of up to 50 basis points we believe the higherthantargeted sales growth will support mid singledigit consolidated operating profit growth as discussed on page 15 net interest expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately even with 2006 results and our consolidated effective income tax rate could be lower than the 2006 rate of approximately 32 these two factors are expected to provide leverage for purposes of achieving our target of high singledigit growth in 2007 net earnings per share in addition we remain committed to reinvesting in brand building costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities lastly we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently targeting a level of 9501025 million for 2007

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

our company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations we use derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks as a matter of policy we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to thirdparty purchases intercompany loans and product shipments and nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and enter into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2006 was 455 million representing a settlement obligation of 1 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2005 was 467 million representing a settlement obligation of 22 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 46 million at yearend 2006 and 47 million at yearend 2005 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures

our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

 

note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on our significant debt issues there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at yearend 2006 and 2005 assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 20 million in 2006 and 9 million in 2005 

 

price risk 

 

our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa paperboard natural gas and diesel fuel we have historically used the combination of longterm contracts with suppliers and 

exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months during 2006 we entered into two separate 10year overthecounter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes the notional amount of the swaps totaled approximately 209 million which currently equates to approximately 50 of our north america manufacturing needs 

 

the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2006 including the natural gas swaps was 239 million representing a settlement obligation of approximately 11 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices the settlement obligation would increase by approximately 17 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2005 was 22 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 1 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices this settlement receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately 1 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases 

 

in addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above we use longterm contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure it should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company

the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment if carrying value exceeds current fair value the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings events and conditions which could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which the company operates including competition and advances in technology a significant product liability or intellectual property claim or other factors leading to reduction in expected sales or profitability should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired the company’s consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected 

as of december 31 2005 the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately 49 billion of which 35 billion was goodwill and 14 billion represented trademarks trade names and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of 106 billion and shareholders’ equity of 23 billion 

the company may not achieve its targeted cost savings from cost reduction initiatives 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry the company has invested a significant amount in capital expenditure to improve its operational facilities ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production procurement or logistical changes and these as well as any failure by the company to achieve its planned cost savings could have a material adverse effect on its business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of its operations and profitability 

6 the company has a substantial amount of indebtedness 

the company has indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2005 the company had total debt of approximately 49 billion and shareholders’ equity of 23 billion 

the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 the company’s ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance its obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on the company’s financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions the availability of and interest rates on short term financing and to financial business and other factors beyond the company’s control 

the results of the company may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials including agricultural commodities fuel and labor 

agricultural commodities including corn wheat soybean oil sugar and cocoa are the principal raw materials used in the company’s products cartonboard corrugated and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by the company the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and the company is unable to increase its prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes the results of its operations could be materially and adversely affected 

cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fuelled by natural gas or propane which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers shortterm standby propane storage exists at several plants for use of interruption in natural gas supplies oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in addition considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of the company’s products the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions government policy and regulation war or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated operating results or financial condition 

a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated operating results or financial conditions 

additionally the company’s labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees the company sponsors a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations including pension retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment the company also participates in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of its manufacturing locations the company’s major pension plans and us retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds real estate and other investments the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as a change in the assumed and actual rate of return on major plan assets a change in the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure obligations the rate of health care cost inflation and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements 

the company may be unable to maintain its profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment in addition the loss of one of the company’s largest customers could negatively impact its sales and profits 

the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates accounted for approximately 17 of consolidated net sales during 2005 comprised principally of sales within the united states at december 31 2005 approximately 12 of the company’s consolidated receivables balance and 17 of the company’s us receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by walmart stores inc and its affiliates during 2005 the company’s top five 

7 customers collectively accounted for approximately 31 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 42 of us net sales as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger the large retail customers of the company may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if the company is unable to use its scale marketing expertise product innovation and category leadership positions to respond the profitability or volume growth of the company could be negatively affected the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact its sales and profits 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition 

the company’s activities both in and outside of the united states are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial and local laws regulations and government agencies including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us departments of agriculture commerce and labor as well as similar and other authorities of the european union and various state provincial and local governments as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies various state and local agencies also regulate the company’s activities 

the manufacturing marketing and distribution of food products is subject to governmental regulation that is becoming increasingly onerous those regulations control such matters as ingredients advertising relations with distributors and retailers health and safety and the environment the company is also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements trade and pricing practices tax and environmental matters the need to comply with new or revised tax environmental or other laws or regulations or new or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure which could negatively impact its operating results 

the company holds assets and incurs liabilities earns revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso because the company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars the company must translate its assets liabilities revenue and expenses into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates consequently increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency to the extent the company fails to manage its foreign currency exposure adequately the company’s consolidated results of operations may be negatively affected 

if the company’s food products become adulterated or misbranded it might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result 

the company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded the company may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products cause injury a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time the company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s food products which could have a material adverse effect on its business results and the value of its brands

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend kellogg company and subsidiaries 

results of operations 

overview 

kellogg company is the world’s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods including cookies crackers toaster pastries cereal bars frozen waffles and meat alternatives kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally we currently manage our operations based on the geographic regions of north america europe latin america and asia pacific this organizational structure is the basis of the operating segment data presented in this report 

we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our longterm annual growth targets of low singledigit for internal net sales mid singledigit for internal operating profit and high singledigit for net earnings per share our measure of “internal growth” excludes the impact of currency and if applicable acquisitions dispositions and shipping day differences in combination with an attractive dividend yield we believe this profitable growth will provide strong total return to our shareholders we plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business expanding our snacks business and pursuing selected growth opportunities we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize sales dollars over shipment volume volume to value as well as cash flow and return on invested capital manage for cash  we believe the success of our strategy and operating principles are reflected in our steady growth in earnings and strong cash flow over the past several years this performance has been achieved despite significant challenges such as rising commodity fuel energy and employee benefit costs as well as increased investment in brand building innovation and costreduction initiatives 

for the year ended december 31 2005 the company reported diluted net earnings per share of 236 a 10 increase over fiscal 2004 results consolidated net sales grew approximately 6 operating profit increased 4 and net earnings were up 10 for the year ended january 1 2005 net earnings per share were 214 an 11 increase over fiscal 2003 net earnings per share of 192 for 2005 net cash provided from operating activities was 11433 million and included nearly 200 million of incremental benefit plan funding as compared to the 2004 amount of 12290 million 

net sales and operating profit 

2005 compared to 2004 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2005 versus 2004 

   11 during 2005 consolidated net sales increased nearly 6 internal net sales also grew approximately 6 which was on top of 5 internal sales growth in the prior year 

during the year successful innovation and brandbuilding investment continued to drive strong growth across our north american business units which collectively reported a 7 increase in net sales versus 2004 internal net sales of our north america retail cereal business increased 8 with strong performance in both the united states and canada as a result our dollar share of the us readytoeat cereal category increased 40 basis points during 2005 to 337 as of january 1 2006 representing the sixth consecutive year of share growth 

internal net sales of our north america retail snacks business consisting of wholesome snacks cookies crackers and toaster pastries increased 7 on top of 8 growth in 2004 this growth was attributable principally to sales of fruit snacks toaster pastries cracker products and major cookie brands partially offsetting this growth was the impact of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie innovations 

internal net sales of our north america frozen and specialty channel which includes food service vending convenience drug stores and custom manufacturing businesses collectively increased approximately 8 led by solid contributions from our eggo ® frozen foods and food service businesses 

net sales in our european operating segment were approximately even with 2004 with internal net sales growth at nearly 2 this growth was largely due to cereal and snacks sales across southern europe partially offset by a sales decline in our nordics market which resulted from a temporary delisting by a major customer despite intense competitive pressures on our uk business unit we were able to maintain sales within this market at nearly the prioryear level 

strong performance in latin america resulted in net sales growth of nearly 15 with internal sales growth at 11 most of this growth was due to strong performance by our mexico venezuela and caribbean business units although sales increased in virtually all the latin american markets in which we do business 

net sales in our asia pacific operating segment increased approximately 3 with internal net sales growth at 1 this sales increase was largely due to innovationrelated growth in our asian markets partially offset by a decline in our australian business which was unfavorably impacted by competitive nutritional claims and timing of snack product innovation versus the prior year in late 2005 we introduced new products and undertook healthoriented initiatives which we believe will mitigate these inmarket factors during 2006 

consolidated operating profit increased 4 during 2005 with our european operating segment contributing approximately onehalf of the total dollar increase this disproportionate contribution was attributable to a yearoveryear shift in segment allocation of charges from costreduction initiatives as discussed in the section beginning on page 14 the yearoveryear change in project cost allocation was a 65 million decline in europe improving 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 22 and a 46 million increase in north america reducing 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4 

internal growth in consolidated operating profit was 5 this internal growth was achieved despite double digit growth in brandbuilding and innovation expenditures and significant cost pressures on gross margin as discussed in the section beginning on page 13 during 2005 we increased our consolidated brandbuilding advertising and consumer promotion expenditures by more than 1 1  2 times the rate of sales growth 

2004 compared to 2003 

the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2004 versus 2003 

   12 during 2004 consolidated net sales increased approximately 9 internal net sales grew 5 which was on top of approximately 4 growth in the prior year during 2004 successful innovation and brandbuilding investment continued to drive growth in most of our businesses 

north america reported net sales growth of approximately 7 with internal growth across all major product groups internal net sales of our north america retail cereal business increased approximately 2 with successful innovation and consumer promotion activities supporting sales growth and category share gains in both the united states and canada internal net sales of our north america retail snacks business increased 8 with the wholesome snacks crackers and toaster pastries components of our snacks portfolio all contributing to that growth while our cookie sales were essentially unchanged from the prior year we were pleased with this performance in light of a category decline in measured channels of approximately 4 we believe the recovery of our snacks business this year was due primarily to successful product and packaging innovation combined with effective execution in our direct storedoor dsd delivery system internal net sales of our north america frozen and specialty channel businesses collectively increased approximately 4 

net sales in our european operating segment increased approximately 16 with internal sales growth of nearly 4 both our uk business unit and paneuropean cereal business achieved internal net sales growth for the year of approximately 2 sales of our snack products within the region grew at a strong doubledigit rate 

strong performance in latin america resulted in net sales growth of approximately 8 with internal net sales growth of 11 more than offsetting unfavorable foreign currency movements most of this growth was due to very strong pricemix and tonnage improvements in both cereal and snack sales by our mexican business unit 

net sales in our asia pacific operating segment increased approximately 14 due primarily to favorable foreign currency movements with internal net sales growth at 2 strong internal net sales performance in australia was partially offset by a sales decline in asia due primarily to the effect of negative publicity regarding sugarcontaining products in korea throughout most of the year 

consolidated operating profit increased approximately 9 during 2004 with internal growth of more than 4 this internal growth was achieved despite increased brandbuilding expenditures and significantly higher commodity costs furthermore corporate operating profit for 2004 included a charge of 95 million related to ceo transition expenses lastly as discussed in the “costreduction initiatives” section beginning on page 14 we absorbed in operating profit significant upfront costs in both 2003 and 2004 with 2004 charges exceeding 2003 charges by approximately 38 million 

the ceo transition expenses arose from the departure of carlos gutierrez the company’s former ceo related to his appointment as us secretary of commerce in early 2005 the total charge net of forfeitures of 95 million was comprised principally of 37 million for special pension termination benefits and 55 million for accelerated vesting of 606250 stock options 

operating profit for each of fiscal 2003 and 2004 includes intangibles impairment losses of approximately 10 million the 2003 loss was to reduce the carrying value of a contractbased intangible asset and was included in north american operating profit the 2004 loss was comprised of 79 million to write off the remaining value of this same contractbased intangible asset in north america and 25 million to write off goodwill in latin america 

margin performance 

margin performance is presented in the following table 

  our longterm goal is to achieve annual improvements in gross margin and to reinvest this growth in brandbuilding and innovation expenditures so as to maintain a relatively steady operating margin our strategy for expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures through salesdriven operating leverage mix improvements productivity savings and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging in 2004 our consolidated gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 449 for 2005 we were able to maintain our consolidated gross margin at this level overcoming the impact of several significant cost factors as discussed in the following paragraphs supported by late 2005 price increases in various markets and payback from prior investment we expect to moderately expand our gross margin again in 2006 

in 2005 we experienced an uncontrollable weatherrelated hike in fuel and energy costs during the second half of the year while in 2004 our 

13 commodity costs rose significantly and remained historically high throughout 2005 in summary we believe market price inflation negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in 2004 and a net 30 basis points in 2005 60 basis points from fuelenergy partially offset by an easing in certain commodity prices our profitability projections for 2006 currently include a 90100 basis point unfavorable gross margin impact from fuel energy and other commodity price inflation 

employee benefit costs the majority of which is recorded in cost of goods sold also increased for both 2004 and 2005 with total active and retired employee benefits expense reaching nearly 300 million in 2005 versus approximately 260 million in 2004 and 240 million in 2003 our profitability projections for 2006 currently include incremental employee benefits expense of 2040 million 

in addition to external cost pressures our discretionary investment in cost reduction initiatives refer to following section has placed shortterm pressure on our gross margin performance during the periods presented the portion of total programrelated charges recorded in cost of goods sold was in millions 200590 200446 200367 additionally cost of goods sold for 2005 includes a charge of approximately 12 million related to a lumpsum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our us cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the company covering the fouryear period ended october 2009 

costreduction initiatives 

we view our continued spending on costreduction initiatives as part of our sustainable growth model of earnings reinvestment for reliability in meeting longterm growth targets initiatives undertaken must meet certain payback and internal rate of return irr targets we currently require each project to recover total cash implementation costs within a fiveyear period of completion or to achieve an irr of at least 20 each costreduction initiative is of relatively short duration normally one year or less and begins to deliver cash savings andor reduced depreciation during the first year of implementation which is then used to fund new initiatives to implement these programs the company has incurred various upfront costs including asset writeoffs exit charges and other project expenditures which we include in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the “net sales and operating profit” section beginning on page 11 

in 2005 we undertook an initiative to consolidate us snacks bakery capacity resulting in the closure of two facilities by mid 2006 major initiatives commenced in 2004 were the global rollout of the sap information technology system reorganization of paneuropean operations consolidation of us meat alternatives manufacturing operations and relocation of our us snacks business unit to battle creek michigan major actions implemented in 2003 included a wholesome snack plant consolidation in australia manufacturing capacity rationalization in the mercosur region of latin america and a plant workforce reduction in great britain additionally during all periods presented we have undertaken various manufacturing capacity rationalization and efficiency initiatives primarily in our north american and european operating segments as well as the 2003 disposal of a manufacturing facility in china details of each initiative are described in note 3 to consolidated financial statements 

related to the aforementioned us snacks bakery consolidation we expect to incur approximately 30 million of project costs in 2006 twothirds comprised of cash costs and onethird asset writeoffs other potential initiatives to be commenced in 2006 are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as management commits to these discretionary investments our 2006 earnings target includes projected charges related to potential cost reduction initiatives of approximately 90 million or 15 per share except for the portion attributable to the aforementioned us snacks bakery consolidation of 30 million the specific cash versus noncash mix or cost of goods sold versus sga impact of the remaining 60 million has not yet been determined 

for 2005 total programrelated charges were approximately 90 million comprised of 16 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability 44 million of asset writeoffs and 30 million for severance and other cash expenditures all of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the company’s north american operating segment 

for 2004 total programrelated charges were approximately 109 million comprised of 41 million in asset writeoffs 1 million for special pension termination benefits 15 million in severance and other exit costs and 52 million in other cash expenditures such as relocation and consulting approximately 46 million of the total 2004 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold with approximately 63 million recorded in selling general and administrative sga expense the 2004 charges impacted our operating segments as follows in millions north america44 europe65 

for 2003 total programrelated charges were approximately 71 million comprised of 40 million in asset writeoffs 8 million for special pension termination benefits and 23 million in severance and other cash exit costs approximately 67 million of the total 2003 charges were recorded in cost of 

14 goods sold with approximately 4 million recorded in sga expense the 2003 charges impacted our operating segments as follows in millions north america36 europe21 latin america8 asia pacific6 

exit cost reserves were approximately 13 million at december 31 2005 consisting principally of severance obligations associated with projects commenced in 2005 which are expected to be paid out in 2006 at january 1 2005 exit cost reserves were approximately 11 million representing severance costs that were substantially paid out in 2005 

interest expense 

between the acquisition of keebler foods company in early 2001 and the end of 2004 our company paid down nearly 20 billion of debt even earlyretiring longterm debt in each of the past three years net earlyretirement premiums are recorded in interest expense and were in millions 200513 20044 200317 these premiums were or are expected to be largely recovered through lower shortterm interest rates over the original remaining terms of the retired debt as a result of this debt reduction interest expense declined significantly from 2003 to 2004 but leveled off in 2005 as we reached a nearterm steady state debt position by yearend 2005 which is discussed further in the liquidity and capital resources section on page 16 nevertheless based on prevailing interest rates we currently expect 2006 interest expense to decline 45 from the 2005 amount due primarily to a shift in our total debt mix from higherrate long term to lowerrate short term 

 other income expense net 

other income expense net includes nonoperating items such as interest income foreign exchange gains and losses charitable donations and gains on asset sales other income expense for 2005 includes charges of 16 million for contributions to the kellogg’s corporate citizenship fund a private trust established for charitable giving and a charge of approximately 7 million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value the carrying value of all heldforsale assets at december 31 2005 was insignificant 

other income expense net for 2004 includes charges of approximately 9 million for contributions to the kellogg’s corporate citizenship fund other income expense net for 2003 includes credits of approximately 17 million related to favorable legal settlements a charge of 8 million for a contribution to the kellogg’s corporate citizenship fund and a charge of 65 million to recognize the impairment of a costbasis investment in an ecommerce business venture 

income taxes 

the consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was approximately 31 which was below both the 2004 rate of nearly 35 and the 2003 rate of less than 33 as compared to the priorperiod rates the 2005 consolidated effective income tax rate benefited primarily from the 2004 reorganization of our european operations and to a lesser extent from us tax legislation that allows a phasedin deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified production income “qpi” beginning in 2005 the resulting tax savings have been reinvested in part in costreduction initiatives brandbuilding expenditures and other growth initiatives we currently expect our 2006 consolidated effective income tax rate to be 3132 however this projection could be significantly affected by the implementation of taxsavings initiatives currently in the planning stages the settlement of several ongoing domestic and international income tax audits or other similar discrete events within interim periods of 2006 we expect that any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be invested in costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities 

during 2005 we elected to repatriate approximately 11 billion of dividends from foreign subsidiaries which qualified for the temporary dividendsreceiveddeduction available under the american jobs creation act the associated net tax cost of approximately 40 million was provided for in 2004 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions this cashgenerating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products net of costs to manufacture and market our products our cash conversion cycle is relatively short although receivable collection patterns vary around the world in the united states our days sales outstanding dso averages 1819 days as a result the growth in our operating cash flow should generally reflect the growth in our net earnings over time as presented in the schedule to the right operating cash flow performance for 2004 generally reflects this principle except for the level of benefit plan contributions and working capital movements operating assets and liabilities in addition to these two variables operating cash flow performance for 2005 further deviates from this pattern due principally to the significant portion of net earnings growth for the year attributable to noncash deferred income tax benefits 

  the increasing level of benefit plan contributions during the 20032005 timeframe primarily reflects our decisions to improve the funded position of several of our major pension and retiree health care plans as influenced by tax strategies and market factors we did not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the periods presented nor do we expect to have in the next several years 

total minimum benefit plan contributions for 2006 are currently expected to be approximately 59 million actual 2006 or future year’s contributions could exceed our current projections as influenced by our decision to voluntarily prefund our obligations versus other competing investment priorities future changes in government requirements or renewals of union contracts 

for 2005 the net favorable movement in core working capital was related to increased trade payables partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade receivables which returned to historical levels in relation to sales in early 2005 from lower levels at the end of 2004 we believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our 53rd week over the 2004 holiday period which impacted the core working capital component of our operating cash flow throughout 2005 core working capital as a percentage of sales has steadily improved over the past several years representing 70 of net sales for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 73 for 2004 and 82 for 2003 we have achieved this multiyear reduction primarily through logistics improvements to reduce inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer requirements faster collection of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables while our longterm goal is to continue to improve this metric we no longer expect movements in the absolute balance of core working capital to represent a significant source of operating cash flow 

the unfavorable movements in other working capital for 2004 as presented in the preceding table relate largely to higher income tax payments and faster payment of customer promotional incentives as compared to prior years 

16 our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions we use this nongaap measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distributions acquisition opportunities and share repurchase our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure as follows 

 our 2005 cash flow as defined declined approximately 19 versus the prior year attributable primarily to incremental benefit plan contributions as discussed on page 16 and increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our company’s strong sales growth over the past several years this increased capital spending represented 37 of net sales which exceeds our recent historical spending level of approximately 3 of net sales for both 2004 and 2003 we expect this trend to continue in the near term with projected 2006 property expenditures reaching approximately 40 of net sales we currently expect our cash flow for 2006 to be 875975 million with the increase over the 2005 amount funded principally by a decline in benefit plan contributions partially offset by a slight increase in capital spending as a percentage of sales 

in order to support the continued growth of our north american fruit snacks business we completed two separate business acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately 50 million in cash including related transaction costs in june 2005 we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from kraft foods inc the facility is located in chicago illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly and salaried employees in november 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a washington statebased manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks 

for 2005 our board of directors had originally authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to 400 million in october 2005 our board of directors approved an increase in the authorized amount of 2005 stock repurchases to 675 million and an additional 650 million for 2006 pursuant to this authorization in november 2005 we repurchased approximately 94 million common shares from the wk kellogg foundation trust the “trust” for 400 million in a privately negotiated transaction pursuant to an agreement dated as of november 8 2005 the “2005 agreement” the 2005 agreement provided the trust with registration rights in certain circumstances for additional common shares which the trust might desire to sell and provided the company with rights to repurchase those additional common shares in combination with open market transactions completed prior to november 2005 we spent a total of 664 million to repurchase approximately 154 million shares during 2005 pursuant to similar board authorizations applicable to those years we paid 298 million in 2004 for approximately 73 million shares and 90 million during 2003 for approximately 29 million shares 

in connection with our 2006 stock repurchase authorization we entered into an agreement with the trust dated as of february 16 2006 the “2006 agreement” to repurchase approximately 128 million additional shares from the trust for 550 million the 2006 agreement extinguished the registration and repurchase rights under the 2005 agreement upon the company’s repurchase of those additional shares on february 21 2006 

in july 2005 we redeemed 7234 million of longterm debt representing the remaining principal balance of our 60 us dollar notes due april 2006 in october 2005 we repaid 200 million of maturing 4875 us dollar notes in december 2005 we redeemed 354 million of us dollar notes due june 2008 these payments were funded principally through issuance of us dollar shortterm debt 

during november 2005 subsidiaries of the company issued approximately 930 million of foreign currencydenominated debt in offerings outside of the united states consisting of euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 and approximately c330 million of canadian commercial paper these debt issuances were guaranteed by the company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the american jobs creation act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company as well as for general corporate purposes refer to note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these debt issuances 

at december 31 2005 our total debt was approximately 49 billion approximately even with the balance at yearend 2004 as discussed in the interest expense section on page 15 this debt balance represents nearly a 20 billion reduction from a peak level of 68 billion in early 2001 during 2005 we increased our benefit trust investments through plan funding by approximately 13 reduced the company’s common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4 and implemented a midyear increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 10 primarily due to the recent 

17 prioritization of these uses of cash flow plus the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity we no longer expect to reduce debt at the recent historical pace but remain committed to net debt reduction total debt less cash over the long term we currently expect the total debt balance at yearend 2006 to remain at approximately 49 billion 

we believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future while still meeting our operational needs including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities through our strong cash flow our program of issuing shortterm debt and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis our significant longterm debt issues do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings a change in the company’s credit ratings could limit its access to the us shortterm debt market andor increase the cost of refinancing longterm debt in the future however even under these circumstances we would continue to have access to our credit facilities which are in amounts sufficient to cover the outstanding shortterm debt balance and debt principal repayments through 2006 

offbalance sheet arrangements and other obligations 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations further information on debt obligations is contained in note 7 within notes to consolidated financial statements further information on lease obligations is contained in note 6 

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately 13 million and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of dsd route franchises up to 17 million we record the fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet which we currently estimate to be insignificant refer to note 6 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

significant accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements none of the pronouncements adopted during the periods presented have had or are expected to have a significant impact on our company’s financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123revised “sharebased payment” which we adopted as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year using the modified prospective method accordingly 

18 prior years were not restated but 2006 results are being presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation from our 1996 fiscal year if this standard had been adopted in 2005 net earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately 09 and we currently expect a similar impact of adoption for 2006 however the actual impact on 2006 will in part depend on the particular structure of stockbased awards granted during the year and various market factors that affect the fair value of awards we classify pretax stock compensation expense in selling general and administrative expense principally within our corporate operations 

sfas no 123revised also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings will be presented in the statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow if this standard had been adopted in 2005 operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by approximately 20 million as a result of this provision the actual impact on 2006 operating cash flow will depend in part on the volume of employee stock option exercises during the year and the relationship between the exercisedate market value of the underlying stock and the original grantdate fair value determined for financial reporting purposes 

our critical accounting estimates which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements are discussed in the following sections on pages 1921 

promotional expenditures 

our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve instore displays and events feature price discounts on our products consumer coupons contests and loyalty programs and similar activities the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period on a fullyear basis these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented in excess of 4 004 of our company’s net sales however as our company’s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented nearly 30 of 2005 net sales the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

intangibles 

we follow sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in evaluating impairment of intangibles under this standard goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction similarly impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset fair values of nongoodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset for instance cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data current and anticipated market conditions management plans and market comparables we periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process at december 31 2005 intangible assets net were 49 billion consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company while we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our north american snacks business or the weighted average cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses 

retirement benefits 

our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments we follow sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits 

19 provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees’ active working life inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the longterm rates of return on plan assets the health care cost trend rates and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans which cover employees in the united states united kingdom and canada 

to conduct our annual review of the longterm rate of return on plan assets we work with third party financial consultants to model expected returns over a 20year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forwardlooking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on longterm bonds priceearnings ratios of the major stock market indices and longterm inflation our us plan model corresponding to approximately 70 of our trust assets globally currently incorporates a longterm inflation assumption of 28 and an active management premium of 1 net of fees validated by historical analysis although we review our expected longterm rates of return annually our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our expected rates of return are generally not revised provided these rates continue to fall within a “more likely than not” corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected longterm returns as determined by our modeling process our assumed rate of return for us plans in 2005 of 89 equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of our 2005 model similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets reflecting local economic conditions foreign plan investments represent approximately 30 of our global benefit plan investments 

based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 31 2005 a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2006 benefits expense by approximately 36 million correspondingly a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2006 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss any arising assetrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a fiveyear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized using a decliningbalance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 12 years under this recognition method a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2006 would reduce pretax earnings by approximately 1 million in 2007 increasing to approximately 6 million in year 2011 for each of the three years ending december 31 2005 our actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions 2005394 2004956 20032694 

to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates we work with third party financial consultants to model our actual claims cost data over a fiveyear historical period including an analysis of pre65 versus post65 age groups and other important demographic components of our covered employee population this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding shortterm future trends in comparison to our actual fiveyear compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 9 our initial trend rate for 2006 of 105 reflects the expected future impact of fastergrowing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population our initial rate is trended downward by 1 per year until the ultimate trend rate of 475 is reached the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually as necessary to approximate the current economic view on the rate of longterm inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium based on consolidated obligations at december 31 2005 a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2006 benefits expense by approximately 17 million a 100 basis point excess of 2006 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately 9 million any arising claims costrelated experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of claims cost over a fouryear period once recognized experience gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants which for us plans is presently about 15 years the combined net experience loss arising from recognition of all prioryears claims experience together with the revised trend rate assumption was approximately 129 million 

to conduct our annual review of discount rates we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index ® for our us plans to test the appropriateness of these indices we 

20 periodically engage third party financial consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities consisting principally of aarated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions noncallable issues with at least 25 million principal outstanding the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due for those years where no suitable bonds are available the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years as of three different interim dates in 2005 this matching exercise for our us plans produced a discount rate within  10 basis points of the equivalentdated citigroup pension liability index ®  the measurement dates for our benefit plans are generally consistent with our company’s fiscal year end thus we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year based on consolidated obligations at december 31 2005 a 25 basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2006 benefits expense by approximately 15 million all obligationrelated experience gains and losses are amortized using a straightline method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience as of december 31 2005 we had consolidated unamortized net experience losses of approximately 129 billion of this total approximately 70 was related to discount rate reductions 13 was related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate with the remainder related to asset returns and other demographic factors for 2006 we currently expect incremental amortization of experience losses of approximately 10 million assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions annual amortization of accumulated experience losses during each of the next several years would remain approximately level with the 2006 amount 

income taxes 

our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution our tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet principally within accrued income taxes significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements historically tax reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1 of earnings before income taxes annually 

future outlook 

our longterm annual growth targets are low singledigit for internal net sales mid singledigit for internal operating profit and high singledigit for net earnings per share in addition we remain committed to growing our brandbuilding investment faster than the rate of sales growth in general we expect 2006 results to be consistent with our growth targets for net sales and operating profit we expect each of our operating segments to deliver low singledigit net sales growth in 2006 except for latin america which we expect to achieve mid singledigit growth due to a continuation of the more rapid category expansion in that region we expect the reported increase in net earnings per share to be dampened by approximately 09 due to the adoption of sfas no 123revised as discussed on pages 18 and 19 we will continue to reinvest in costreduction initiatives and other growth opportunities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as a part of the ongoing business operations and management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments where appropriate to manage these risks the company as a matter of policy does not engage in trading or speculative transactions refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements which are included herein under part ii item 8 for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 

foreign exchange risk 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to thirdparty purchases 

21 intercompany transactions and nonfunctional currency denominated thirdparty debt the company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments additionally the company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso and in the case of intersubsidiary transactions the british pound versus the euro management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational positions and enters into forward contracts options and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 

the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2005 was 4673 million representing a settlement obligation of 219 million the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at yearend 2004 was 3755 million representing a settlement obligation of 603 million all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions translational exposure or existing assets or liabilities and mature within 18 months assuming an unfavorable 10 change in yearend exchange rates the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 467 million at yearend 2005 and 375 million at yearend 2004 these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

interest rate risk 

the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates management periodically uses interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions 

note 7 to the consolidated financial statements which are included herein under part ii item 8 provides information on the company’s significant debt issues there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at yearend 2005 and 2004 assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately 91 million in 2005 and 23 million in 2004 

price risk 

the company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials fuel and energy primary exposures include corn wheat soybean oil sugar cocoa paperboard natural gas and diesel fuel management uses the combination of long cash positions with suppliers and exchangetraded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases over a duration of generally less than one year the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2005 was 218 million representing a settlement receivable of approximately 10 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices this settlement receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately 13 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at yearend 2004 was 613 million representing a settlement obligation of 48 million assuming a 10 decrease in yearend commodity prices this settlement obligation would have increased by approximately 56 million generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases 

in addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above management uses long cash positions with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure it should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of the company

customers collectively accounted for approximately 18 of both the company’s consolidated and us net sales there has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and the company believes that this trend is likely to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact the company’s sales and profits the company does not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for the company’s products and the company’s relationships with its customers products of the company have been generally sold through its own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores restaurants and other food service establishments   backlog for the most part orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment the backlog of any unfilled orders at december
