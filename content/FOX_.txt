50 of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach in december 2017 the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying retaining or eliminating the 39 national television audience reach limitation including the uhf discount if the fcc determines in the future to eliminate the uhf discount and the national television audience reach limitation is not eliminated or modified the companys ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be negatively affected 

the company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership for example fcc dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — fox abc cbs and nbc — from being under common ownership or control in addition under the communications act no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of the corporations stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country this ownership limit can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest the fcc could review the companys compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of fox television stations license renewal applications the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the companys board of directors to take action to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder 

carriage and content regulations fcc regulations require each television broadcaster to elect at threeyear intervals either to require carriage of its signal by traditional mvpds in the stations market or to negotiate the terms through which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional mvpds within its market which we refer to as retransmission consent fox television stations have historically elected retransmission consent for all of their owned and operated stations and the company has been compensated as a result 

federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 ½ minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week in addition under fcc regulations television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming which among other requirements must serve as a significant purpose the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under under fcc rules that were revised in 2019 one of the three hours per week may air on a televisions stations multicast streams the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream a television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions including monetary fines and the possible nonrenewal of its license 

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 600 am and 1000 pm federal law currently authorizes the fcc to impose fines of up to 445445 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts the fcc may impose fines or revoke licenses for serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition because indecency complaints are confidential there may be pending nonpublic complaints alleging the broadcast of indecent or profane material by fox television stations and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints 

modifications to the companys programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of fox television stations and the fox network if indecency regulation is extended to internet or cable and satellite programming and such extension was found to be constitutional some of the companys other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels 

the fcc continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification political advertising childrens television environmental concerns emergency alerting and information equal employment opportunity technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance in addition the federal trade commission or ftc has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices particularly with respect to social media marketing both fcc and ftc rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and 

conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser 

fcc rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming in addition federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 80 largest markets to carry a specified minimum number of hours of primetime or childrens programming per calendar quarter with audio descriptions ie a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel the same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via internet protocol apps or services 

fcc regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations including among other things a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance 

violation of fcc regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures periodic reporting conditions shortterm license renewals and in egregious cases denial of license renewal or revocation of license violation of ftcimposed obligations can result in enforcement actions litigation consent decrees and ultimately substantial monetary fines 

broadcast transmission standard in november 2017 the fcc adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the next generation broadcast television transmission standard developed by the advanced television systems committee inc also referred to as atsc 30 fox television stations is actively building out atsc 30 facilities fox television stations is participating in various atsc 30 testing with other broadcasters but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the companys operations in june 2020 the fcc adopted a declaratory ruling and notice of proposed rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to nonvideo services in june 2022 the fcc issued a third notice of proposed rulemaking that raises a number of questions that could impact the adoption and rollout of both video and nonvideo atsc 30 services as well as the broadcast requirements for the atsc 10 standard 

privacy and information regulation 

the laws and regulations governing the collection use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving particularly as they relate to the companys digital businesses federal and state laws and regulations affecting the companys online services websites and other business activities include the childrens online privacy protection act which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or spam the video privacy protection act which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a video tape service provider the telephone consumer protection act which restricts certain marketing communications such as text messages and calls without explicit consent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the collection handling disclosure and use of certain personal information by companies that offer consumers financial products or services imposes notice obligations and provides certain individual rights regarding the use and disclosure of certain information and the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which imposes broad obligations on the collection use handling and disclosure of personal information of california residents for example subject to certain exceptions the ccpa provides individual rights for californians including to access delete and to restrict the sale of personal information 

a number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection maintenance and use of personal information breach notification requirements and cybersecurity are pending or have been adopted at the state and federal level which would impose additional obligations on businesses including in connection with targeted advertising for example the california privacy rights act the cpra which amends the ccpa was passed in november 2020 and generally takes effect on january 1 2023 among other things the cpra creates a new state privacy protection agency expands individual rights and introduces new requirements for businesses several which are subject to additional rulemaking other states have passed or introduced similar privacy legislation including virginia colorado utah and connecticut in addition the ftc and state attorneys 

general and other regulators have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus other federal and state laws and regulations also may be adopted that impact our digital services including those relating to oversight of usergenerated content 

foreign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations which apply to certain of the companys operations it is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations the eu general data protection regulation in particular regulates the collection use and security of personal data and restricts the transborder flow of such data other countries including the united kingdom canada australia china and mexico also have enacted data protection legislation 

the company monitors and considers these laws and regulations particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs these laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change and could result in increased compliance costs claims financial penalties for noncompliance changes to business practices including with respect to tailored advertising or otherwise impact the companys business violations of these laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties private litigation require us to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address and harm our reputation even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation 

consumer finance laws and regulations 

credible operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces that market and provide services in heavily regulated industries across the united states as a result credible is subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations these include the laws and regulations governing the collection use and transfer of consumer information described above and the following

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property relying upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the companys products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the companys intellectual property the company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of 

approaches including offering legitimate market alternatives deploying digital rights management technologies pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the companys intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights even if not valid such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the companys operations

 item 1a risk factors 

prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the companys securities 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions our business and our industry 

changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and distribution platforms may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the ways in which consumers view content and technology and business models in our industry continue to rapidly evolve and new distribution platforms and increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and have affected advertisers options for reaching their target audiences consumer preferences have evolved towards svod and avod services and other directtoconsumer offerings and there has been a substantial increase in the availability of content with reduced advertising or without advertising at all as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content there is still to be developed a consistent broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry in addition consumers are increasingly using timeshifting and advertisingskipping technologies such as dvrs that enable them to fastforward or circumvent advertisements substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of the companys programming to advertisers and adversely affect our advertising revenues 

changes in consumer behavior and technology have also had an adverse impact on mvpds that deliver the companys broadcast and cable networks to consumers consumers are increasingly turning to alternatives including directtoconsumer offerings which has contributed to industrywide declines in subscribers to mvpd services over the last several years these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over mvpd subscriptions the company may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for the programming on its networks which could lead to lower affiliate fee and advertising revenues changing distribution models may also negatively impact the companys ability to negotiate affiliation agreements on favorable terms which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our affiliate fee and advertising revenues also may be adversely affected by consumers use of antennas and their integration with settop boxes or other consumer devices to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions 

to remain competitive in this evolving environment the company must effectively anticipate and adapt to new market changes the company continues to focus on expanding its digital distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers including through tubi fox nation fox weather and other offerings however if the company fails to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of technological developments and consumer preferences it could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

declines in advertising expenditures could cause the companys revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising and its ability to generate advertising revenues depends on a number of factors the strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries advertisers spending priorities and the economy in general or the economy of an individual geographic market in addition pandemics natural and other disasters acts of terrorism wars and political uncertainties and hostilities can also lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of economic uncertainty disrupted programming and services or reduced advertising spots due to preemptions as described below the covid19 pandemic has caused some of the companys advertisers to reduce their spending in recent years which has had a negative impact on the companys advertising revenues 

major sports events such as the nfls super bowl and the fifa world cup and the state congressional and presidential election cycles also may cause the companys advertising revenues to vary substantially from year to year political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and 

political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on advertising and the competitive nature of the elections affecting viewers in markets featuring our programming 

advertising expenditures may also be affected by changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and platforms there is increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences and demand for the companys programming as measured by ratings points is a key factor in determining the advertising rates as well as the affiliate rates the company receives in addition as described above newer technologies and platforms are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences some of these technologies and platforms allow users to view programming from a remote location or on a timedelayed basis and provide users the ability to fastforward rewind pause and skip programming and advertisements which could negatively affect the attractiveness of the companys offerings to advertisers the pricing and volume of advertising may also be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly from traditional media or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising such as through automated purchasing dynamic advertising insertion third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the company as traditional advertising methods the company also generates advertising revenues through its tubi avod service the market for avod advertising campaigns is relatively new and evolving and if this market develops slower or differently than we expect it could adversely affect our advertising revenues declines in advertising revenues may also be caused by regulatory intervention or other thirdparty action that impacts where and when advertising may be placed 

advertising sales also largely depend on audience measurement and could be negatively affected if measurement methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels although nielsens statistical sampling method is the primary measurement methodology used for our linear television advertising sales we measure and monetize our digital platforms based on a combination of internal and thirdparty data including demographic composite estimates a consistent broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry remains to be developed although we expect multiplatform measurement innovation and standards to benefit us as the video advertising market continues to evolve we are still partially dependent on third parties to provide these solutions 

a decrease in advertising expenditures reduced demand for the companys programming or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the companys content on all platforms could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition or results of operations 

because the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of distributors the failure to enter into or renew affiliation and carriage agreements on favorable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition or results of operations 

the company depends on affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable it to reach a large percentage of households through mvpds and third partyowned television stations the inability to enter into or renew mvpd arrangements on favorable terms or at all or the loss of carriage on mvpds basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the companys owned and operated television stations and broadcast and cable networks which could adversely affect the companys revenues from affiliate fees and its ability to sell national and local advertising time the loss of favorable mvpd packaging positioning pricing or other marketing opportunities could also negatively impact the companys revenues from affiliate fees these risks are exacerbated by consolidation among traditional mvpds their increased vertical integration into the cable or broadcast network business and their use of alternative technologies to offer their subscribers access to local broadcast network programming which have provided traditional mvpds with greater negotiating leverage competitive pressures faced by mvpds particularly in light of the lower retail prices of streaming services could adversely affect the terms of our contract renewals with mvpds in addition if the company and an mvpd reach an impasse in contract renewal negotiations the companys networks and owned and operated television stations could become unavailable to the mvpds subscribers ie go dark which depending on the length of time and the size of the mvpd could have a negative impact on the companys revenues from affiliate fees and advertising 

the company also depends on the maintenance of affiliation agreements and license agreements with third partyowned television stations to distribute the fox network and mynetworktv in markets where the company does not own television stations consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage and reduce the number of available distribution partners there can be no assurance that these affiliation and license agreements will be renewed in the future on terms favorable to the company the inability to enter into affiliation or licensing arrangements with thirdparty owned television stations on favorable terms could reduce distribution of the fox network and mynetworktv and the inability to enter into such affiliation or licensing arrangements for the fox network on favorable terms could adversely affect the companys affiliate fee revenues and its ability to sell national advertising time 

in addition the company has arrangements through which it makes its content available for viewing through thirdparty online video platforms if these arrangements are not renewed on favorable or commercially reasonable terms or at all it could adversely affect the companys revenues and operating results 

if the number of subscribers to mvpd services continues to decline or such declines accelerate the companys affiliate fee and advertising revenues could be negatively affected 

as described above changes in technology and consumer behavior have contributed to industrywide declines in the number of subscribers to mvpd services which have had a negative impact on the number of subscribers to the companys networks these industrywide subscriber declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future the majority of the companys affiliation agreements with mvpds are multiyear contracts that provide for payments to the company that are based in part on the number of mvpd subscribers covered by the agreement if declines in the number of mvpd subscribers are not fully offset by affiliate rate increases the companys affiliate fee revenues will be negatively affected because mvpd subscriber losses could also decrease the potential audience for the companys networks which is a critical factor affecting both the pricing and volume of advertising future mvpd subscriber declines could also adversely impact the companys advertising revenues 

the company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions including the current inflationary environment and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets 

the us economy has experienced a period of weakness due to among other things the covid19 pandemic which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and results of operations factors that affect economic conditions include inflation global supply chain disruptions the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending habits political and sociopolitical uncertainties and conflicts and potential changes in trade relationships between the us and other countries the company also faces risks associated with the impact of weak economic conditions on advertisers affiliates suppliers wholesale distributors retailers insurers and others with which it does business 

increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult or expensive for the company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time and we cannot guarantee that the company will be able to refinance outstanding indebtedness or obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to the company or at all in addition the companys access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the companys shortterm and longterm debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies if we are not successful in obtaining financing or incur significantly higher borrowing costs than contemplated it may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the companys lenders insurers customers and counterparties including vendors retailers and other partners for instance the inability of the companys counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the company and lead to negative effects on the company including business disruptions decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses 

the covid19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could materially adversely affect the companys business financial condition or results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the companys business covid19 had a significant negative impact on the companys advertisers spending in fiscal 2020 which has lessened in subsequent years however future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could further negatively impact their advertising expenditures in the future although the company has not experienced meaningful subscriber declines due to the pandemic a worsening of the pandemic could cause industrywide changes in consumer behavior such as increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services which could adversely affect the companys future affiliate fee and advertising revenues 

the companys business depends on the volume and popularity of the content it distributes particularly in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 covid19 caused cancellations and postponements of live sports events to which the company had broadcast rights and suspensions of the production of certain entertainment content these content disruptions adversely affected the companys advertising and affiliate revenues and operating expenses if there are similar disruptions in the future there could be additional adverse impacts on such revenues or operating expenses in addition a significant decline in the companys estimated revenues or the expected popularity of its programming could lead to a downward revision in the value of among other things the companys indefinitelived intangible assets programming rights and longlived assets and result in a noncash impairment charge that is material to the companys reported net earnings 

the magnitude of the continuing impact of covid19 and its variants remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on evolving factors the company may be unable to control or accurately predict these include the duration and scope of the pandemic the duration and extent of its impact on global and regional economies and economic activity the effect of governmental actions the impact of the pandemic on the health wellbeing and productivity of the companys employees and the companys ability to conduct its operations and potential changes in consumer behavior the covid19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition or results of operations 

the companys businesses operate in a highly competitive industry 

the company competes with other companies for highquality content to reach large audiences and to generate advertising revenue the company also competes for distribution on mvpds and other thirdparty digital platforms the companys ability to attract viewers and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular programming and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms which are increasing the number of content choices available to audiences the consolidation of advertising agencies distributors and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and made competition for audiences advertising revenue and distribution more intense competition for audiences andor advertising comes from a variety of sources including broadcast television networks cable television systems and networks directtoconsumer live streaming platforms svod and avod services and mobile gaming and social media platforms audio programming and print and other media other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the companys stations or networks or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns in addition some competitors that operate svod services have introduced or are planning to introduce advertisingsupported offerings that may increase competition for audiences andor advertising increased competition in the acquisition of programming may also affect the scope of rights we are able to acquire and the cost of such rights and the future value of the rights we acquire or retain cannot be predicted with certainty entering into or renewing contracts for programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in increased costs to the company with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on mvpds for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from acquired rights contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on the popularity of special sports events and the continued popularity of the sports leagues and teams for which we have programming rights 

our sports business depends on the popularity and success of the sports franchises leagues and teams for which we have acquired broadcast and cable network programming rights if a sports league declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm this may negatively impact viewership and advertising and affiliate fee revenues received in connection with our sports programming our operating results may be impacted in part by special events such as the nfls super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks the mlbs world series and the fifa world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sports events delivered to consumers on our broadcast television and cable networks our advertising and affiliate fee revenues are subject to fluctuations based on the dates of sports events and their availability for viewing through our broadcast television and cable networks and the popularity of the competing teams for example any decrease in the number of postseason games played in a sports league for which we have acquired broadcast programming rights or the participation of a smallermarket sports franchise in postseason competition could result in lower advertising revenues for the company there can be no assurance that any sports league will continue to generate fan enthusiasm or provide the expected number of regular and postseason games for advertisers and customers and the failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally increased competition for the sale of sports event advertising time with other television networks stations and other advertising platforms such as digital media audio and print may adversely affect the companys revenues and operating results a shortfall in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the company has acquired rights or in the volume of sports programming the company expects to distribute could adversely affect the companys advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate fee revenues 

the inability to renew programming rights particularly sports programming rights on sufficiently favorable terms or at all could cause the companys advertising and affiliate fee revenues to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sports events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors programming rights agreements retransmission consent agreements carriage contracts and affiliation agreements have varying durations and renewal terms that are subject to negotiation with other parties the outcome of which is unpredictable in addition competition for popular programming rights and sports programming rights in particular that are licensed from third parties is intense and the licenses have varying duration and renewal terms moreover the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions andor league agreements that we may not be able to control including a decision to alter the number frequency and timing of regular and postseason games played during a season as these contracts expire we may seek renewals on favorable terms however third parties may outbid us for the rights contracts the loss of rights or renewal on less favorable terms could impact the quality or quantity of the companys programs in particular the sports coverage offered by the company its cable networks broadcast stations and affiliates to the fox network and could adversely affect the companys advertising and affiliate fee revenues upon renewal the companys results could be adversely affected if escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising and affiliate fee revenues in addition if the company does not obtain exclusive rights to the programming it distributes it could negatively impact the companys advertising and affiliate fee revenues 

acceptance of the companys content by the public is difficult to predict which could lead to fluctuations in revenues 

television distribution is a speculative business since the revenues derived from the distribution of content depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public which is difficult to predict low public acceptance of the companys content will adversely affect the companys results of operations the commercial success of our programming also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programming the growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in programming and the acquisition of sports rights before we learn the extent to which the content will earn consumer acceptance competition for popular content particularly sports and entertainment programming is intense and the 

company may need to increase the price it pays for popular content rights the companys failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content or a decline in the ratings or popularity of the companys news sports or entertainment television programming which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming could adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate fee revenues 

damage to our brands particularly the fox brand or our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our brands particularly the fox brand are among our most valuable assets we believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business maintaining further enhancing and extending our brands may require us to make significant investments in marketing programming or new products services or events these investments may not be successful we may introduce new programming that is not popular with our consumers and advertisers which may negatively affect our brands to the extent our content in particular our live news and sports programming and primetime entertainment programming is not compelling to consumers our ability to maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted governmental scrutiny and fines and significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations content products management employees practices advertisers business partners and culture including individuals associated with content we create or license may damage the companys reputation and brands even if such claims are untrue furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted if we are not successful in maintaining or enhancing the image or awareness of our brands or if our reputation is harmed for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our investments in new businesses products services and technologies through acquisitions and other strategic investments present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we had contemplated which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have acquired and invested in and expect to continue acquiring and investing in new businesses products services and technologies that complement enhance or expand our current businesses or otherwise offer us growth opportunities such acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from an investment to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the investment a failure of the investment or acquired business to perform as expected meet financial projections or achieve strategic goals a failure to further develop an acquired business product service or technology unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to not realize anticipated benefits or to incur unanticipated liabilities difficulties in integrating the operations personnel technologies and systems of acquired businesses the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses the diversion of management attention from current operations and compliance with new regulatory regimes because acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and their anticipated benefits or value may not materialize our acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of key personnel including talent could disrupt the management or operations of the companys business and adversely affect its revenues 

the companys business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of its chair k rupert murdoch and executive chair and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch and other key employees and news sports and entertainment personalities the company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company including the impairment of the companys ability to execute successfully its business strategy additionally the company employs or independently contracts with several news sports and entertainment personalities with significant loyal audiences news sports and entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of programming on a television station or cable network and therefore a significant influence on the ability of the station or network to sell advertising the companys broadcast television stations and cable networks 

deliver programming with highly regarded onair talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for the distributed news sports and entertainment content there can be no assurance that these news sports and entertainment personalities will remain with us or retain their current appeal or that the costs associated with retaining this and new talent will be favorable or acceptable to us if the company fails to retain or attract these personalities and talent or they lose their current audiences or advertising partners the companys business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

labor disputes involving our own employees or those at businesses we depend on may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

in a variety of the companys businesses the company and its partners engage the services of trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the companys business by causing delays in production or reducing profit margins moreover the company has certain collective bargaining agreements which are industrywide agreements and the company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements in dispute 

in addition our broadcast television and cable networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports leagues to broadcast and produce sports events including certain college football and basketball nfl and mlb games any labor disputes that occur in any sports league for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events resulting in decreased revenues which could adversely affect our business revenue and results of operations 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill intangible assets and programming 

the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including fcc licenses the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and other longlived assets any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of our programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets programming rights investments or longlived assets could result in a noncash impairment charge any such charge could be material to the companys reported net earnings 

risks relating to cybersecurity piracy privacy and data protection 

the degradation failure or misuse of the companys network and information systems and other technology could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data or other confidential information resulting in increased costs liabilities or loss of revenue 

cloud services content delivery and other networks information systems and other technologies that we or our vendors or other partners use including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our content the systems are critical to our business activities and shutdowns or disruptions of and cybersecurity attacks on the systems pose increasing risks disruptions to the systems such as computer hacking and phishing theft computer viruses ransomware worms or other destructive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks or other malicious activities as well as power outages natural or other disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may affect the systems and could result in disruption of our services misappropriation misuse alteration theft loss leakage falsification and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure of confidential or other information including intellectual property and personal data of third parties employees and users of our streaming services and other digital properties contained on the systems the techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and continue to become more sophisticated and targeted while we and our vendors and partners continue to develop implement and maintain security measures seeking to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks including unauthorized access to or misuse of the systems such efforts are 

costly require ongoing monitoring and updating and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring in addition the companys recovery and business continuity plans may not be adequate to address any cybersecurity incidents that occur the companys highprofile sports and entertainment programming and its extensive news coverage of elections sociopolitical events and public controversies subject us to heightened cybersecurity risks although no cybersecurity incident has been material to the companys businesses to date we expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and attacks and there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material incident any cybersecurity incidents could result in a disruption of our operations customer or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to our reputation or brands regulatory investigations claims lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue and the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any incidents the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur 

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and signal theft and limit the companys ability to protect its intellectual property rights 

content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the companys revenues from products and services including television shows cable and other programming the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy as well as cable and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft however policing unauthorized use of the companys products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement although no content theft has been material to the companys businesses to date we expect to continue to be subject to content threats and there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material incident developments in technology including digital copying file compression technology growing penetration of highbandwidth internet connections increased availability and speed of mobile data networks and new devices and applications that enable unauthorized access to content increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to access duplicate widely distribute and store highquality pirated material in addition developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of usergenerated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content including those emanating from other countries in various languages may adversely impact the companys businesses the proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the companys content could have an adverse effect on the companys businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services 

the company takes a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft both individually and in some instances together with industry associations but the protection of the companys intellectual property rights depends on the scope and duration of the companys rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and how those laws are construed if those laws are interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the companys rights or if existing laws are changed the companys ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase a change in the laws of one jurisdiction may also have an impact on the companys overall ability to protect its intellectual property rights across other jurisdictions the companys efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property may not be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft further while piracy and the proliferation of piracyenabling technology tools continue to escalate if any laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed weakened or not adequately enforced or if the applicable legal systems fail to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase 

the company is subject to complex laws regulations rules industry standards and contractual obligations related to privacy and personal data protection which are evolving inconsistent and potentially costly 

we are subject to us federal and state laws as well as laws from other countries relating to the collection use disclosure and security of personal information the number and complexity of these laws continues to increase for example california virginia utah and connecticut have passed legislation imposing 

broad obligations on businesses collection use handling and disclosure of personal information of their respective residents and imposing fines for noncompliance the eu the uk and other countries also have privacy and data security legislation with significant penalties for violations that apply to certain of the companys operations new privacy and data protection laws continue to be introduced and interpretations of existing privacy laws some of which may be inconsistent with one another continue to evolve as a result significant uncertainty exists as to their application and scope compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and could require the company to change its business practices including in connection with datadriven targeted advertising in its digital offerings although the company expends significant resources to comply with privacy and data protection laws we may be subject to regulatory or other legal action despite these efforts any such action could result in damage to our reputation or brands loss of customers or revenue and other negative impacts to our operations the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any claims the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur for more information see item 1 government regulation – privacy and information regulation 

risks relating to legal and regulatory matters 

changes in laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate in general the television broadcasting and traditional mvpd industries in the us are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc the fcc generally regulates among other things the ownership of media broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees for example the company is required to apply for and operate in compliance with licenses from the fcc to operate a television station purchase a new television station or sell an existing television station with licenses generally subject to an eightyear renewable term our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including those relating to issues such as content regulation user privacy and data protection and consumer protection further the united states congress the fcc and state legislatures currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes and measures relating to network neutrality privacy and data security which could directly or indirectly affect the operations and ownership of the companys media properties from time to time the fcc considers whether virtual mvpds should be considered mvpds as defined by the fcc and regulated as such which could negatively impact the companys distribution model any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the companys advertising revenues in addition some policymakers maintain that traditional mvpds should be required to offer a la carte programming to subscribers on a networkbynetwork basis or family friendly programming tiers unbundling packages of program services may increase both competition for carriage on distribution platforms and marketing expenses which could adversely affect the business financial condition and results of operations of the companys cable networks the threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue similarly new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of laws or regulations could require changes in the operations or ownership of our business furthermore new laws regulations and standards related to environmental including climate social and governance matters are likely to impose additional costs on us expose us to new risks and subject us to increasing scrutiny any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities including under fcc rules and policies or delays in our renewal and other applications with the fcc 

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm the fcc has indicated that in addition to issuing fines to licensees it would consider initiating license revocation proceedings for serious indecency violations we air a significant amount of live news reporting and live sports coverage on our broadcast television stations and networks and a portion of our content is under the control of our onair talent the company cannot predict whether information delivered by our stations and onair talent could violate fcc rules related to indecency which had been found to be unconstitutionally vague by the us supreme court especially given the spontaneity of live news and sports programming violation of the fccs indecency rules 

could subject us to government investigation penalties license revocation or renewal or qualification proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the ability of nonus citizens and certain other persons to invest in us 

the company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of us television stations under the communications act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the communications act and the fcc rules without the fccs prior approval no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of its stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to take action to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder we are currently in compliance with applicable us law and continue to monitor our foreign ownership based on our assessment of the information reasonably available to us but we are not able to predict whether we will need to take action pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the fcc could review the companys compliance with applicable us law in connection with its consideration of the companys renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the company owns 

the failure or destruction of satellites or transmitter facilities the company depends on to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect its businesses and results of operations as could changes in fcc regulations governing the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum 

the company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption occurs failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses and results of operations each of the companys television stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses and results of operations further changes in fcc regulations have reduced the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum in 2020 the fcc began reallocating and repacking a band of satellite transmission spectrum known as the cband” used by the television industry to transmit programming in order to free up spectrum for the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services this has reduced the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum for the television industry and additional changes in fcc regulations could lead to further reductions the decreased availability of satellite transmission spectrum could diminish the quality of and increase interference to our transmissions which could significantly hinder the companys ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds 

the company could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxation in us federal state and local as well as certain international jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations practices or the interpretations thereof including changes in legislation currently being considered could adversely affect the companys results of operations or its tax assets judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes in addition transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

tax returns are routinely audited taxrelated litigation or settlements may occur and certain jurisdictions may assess income tax liabilities against us the final outcomes of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our historical tax provisions and accruals these outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings opinions of counsel or other interpretations provided to the company if these matters are adversely resolved we may be required to recognize additional charges to our 

tax provisions and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits including claims relating to competition intellectual property rights employment and labor matters personal injury and property damage free speech customer privacy regulatory requirements and advertising marketing and selling practices greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards including any related investigations and litigation we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to our ownership structure 

certain of the companys directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in news corp or because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of news corp 

in june 2013 21cf completed the separation of its businesses into two independent publicly traded companies by distributing to its shareholders shares of a new company called news corporation news corp certain of the companys directors and executive officers own shares of common stock of news corp and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the companys officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of news corp including our chair k rupert murdoch who serves as news corps executive chairman and our executive chair and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch who serves as news corps cochairman this ownership of or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for news corp and the company in addition to any other arrangements that the company and news corp may agree to implement the company and news corp have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

our amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that our directors and officers as well as certain of our stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of news corp and the company each of which we refer to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of news corp and certain of its affiliates our amended and restated bylaws provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to us or to any of our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity to news corp instead of us the provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities to news corp instead of us 

certain provisions of the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws delaware law the companys stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the companys common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the companys board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock in particular the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

• a dual class common equity capital structure in which holders of fox class a common stock can vote only in very specific limited circumstances 

• a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting unless there are three record holders or fewer 

• special stockholders meeting to be called only by a majority of the board of directors the chair or vice or deputy chair or upon the written request of holders of not less than 20 of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock 

• the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting 

• the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65 of the voting power of the companys outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws 

• restrictions on the transfer of the companys shares and 

• the board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 

these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals desirable 

further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the outstanding fox class a common stock and 421 of fox class b common stock k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional approximately one percent of fox class a common stock and less than one percent of fox class b common stock thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately one percent of fox class a common stock and 427 of fox class b common stock 

this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of fox class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of fox class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement prevents unless the companys board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the companys class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trusts influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the companys board of directors has approved a 4 billion stock repurchase program for the fox class a common stock and fox class b common stock which could increase the percentage of fox class b common stock held by the murdoch family trust the company has entered into a stockholders agreement with the murdoch family trust pursuant to which the company and the murdoch family trust have agreed not to take actions that would result in the murdoch family trust and murdoch family members together owning more than 44 of the outstanding voting power of the shares of fox class b common stock or would increase the murdoch family trusts voting power by more than 175 in any rolling 12month period the murdoch family trust would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the murdoch family trust and the murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44 of the outstanding voting power of the class b common stock except where a murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the murdoch family trust on any matter 

risks related to the companys separation from 21cf 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21cf in connection with the transaction may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21cf the indemnification from 21cf may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities that have been allocated to 21cf 

pursuant to the agreements the company and 21cf entered into in connection with the transaction 21cf will indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company will indemnify 21cf for certain

overview of the companys business 

the company is a news sports and entertainment company which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments 

• cable network programming  which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies traditional mvpds virtual multichannel video programming distributors virtual mvpds and other digital platforms primarily in the us

the companys cable network programming and television segments derive the majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales for fiscal 2022 the company generated revenues of 140 billion of which approximately 49 was generated from affiliate fees approximately 42 was generated from advertising and approximately 9 was generated from other operating activities 

affiliate fees primarily include i monthly subscriberbased license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry our cable networks and our owned and operated television stations and ii fees received from nonowned and operated television stations that are affiliated with the fox network us law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from traditional mvpds that carry the companys broadcast signals 

the companys revenues are impacted by rate changes changes in the number of subscribers to the companys content and changes in the expenditures by advertisers in addition advertising revenues are subject to seasonality and cyclicality as a result of the impact of state congressional and presidential election cycles and special events that air on the companys networks including the national football leagues nfl super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks and the fédération internationale de football association fifa world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sports events including one nfl divisional playoff game that is aired on a rotating annual basis with another network 

the cable network programming and television industries continue to evolve rapidly with changes in technology leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content consumer preferences have evolved toward alternatives including directtoconsumer offerings these changes in technologies and consumer behavior have contributed to declines in the number of subscribers to mvpd services and these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future 

at the same time technological changes have affected advertisers options for reaching their target audiences there has been a substantial increase in the availability of content with reduced advertising or without advertising at all as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content there is still to be developed a consistent broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry furthermore the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending from more traditional media and toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising in addition the market for avod advertising campaigns is relatively new and evolving 

the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is dependent to a large extent on the impact of changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies the sale of advertising the maintenance renewal and terms of its carriage affiliation and content agreements and programming rights the popularity of its content general economic conditions including financial market conditions the companys ability to manage its businesses effectively and its relative strength and leverage in the industry for more information see item 1 business and item 1a risk factors

adjusted ebitda is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and 

impairment charges which are significant components in assessing the companys financial performance adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

use of estimates 

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading use of estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the companys customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment 

the company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the companys network programming to be aired by television networks and cable channels and from sales of advertising on the companys owned and operated television stations and various digital properties advertising revenue from customers primarily advertising agencies is recognized as the commercials are aired certain of the companys advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views referred to as impressions revenues for any audience deficiencies are deferred until the guaranteed number of impressions is met by providing additional advertisements advertising contracts which are generally shortterm are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month with payments due shortly after the invoice date 

the company generates affiliate fee revenue from agreements with traditional and virtual mvpds for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the companys owned and operated television stations in addition the company generates affiliate fee revenue from agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and receives retransmission consent fees from traditional and virtual mvpds for their signals affiliate fee revenue is recognized at a point in time when the network programming is made available to the customer for contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliates subscribers revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period for contracts with fixed affiliate fees revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the contract term which generally reflects the invoiced amount affiliate contracts are generally multiyear contracts with payments due monthly 

the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to traditional mvpds to facilitate carriage of a cable network against affiliate fee revenue the company amortizes the cable distribution investments on a straightline basis over the contract period 

inventories 

the company incurs costs to license programming rights and to produce owned programming licensed programming includes costs incurred by the company for access to content owned by third parties the company has single and multiyear contracts for sports and nonsports programming licensed programming is recorded at the earlier of payment or when the license period has begun the cost of the program is known or reasonably determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing licensed programming is predominately amortized as the associated programs are broadcast the costs of multiyear sports contracts are primarily amortized based on the ratio of each contracts current period attributable revenue to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue estimates can change and accordingly are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary such changes in the future could be material 

owned programming includes content internally developed and produced as well as coproduced content capitalized costs for owned programming are predominately amortized using the individualfilmforecastcomputation method which is based on the ratio of current period revenue to estimated total future remaining revenue and related costs to be incurred throughout the life of the respective program when production 

partners distribute owned programming on the companys behalf the net participation in profits is recorded as content license revenue 

inventories are evaluated for recoverability when an event or circumstance occurs that indicates that fair value may be less than unamortized costs the company will determine if there is an impairment by evaluating the fair value of the inventories which are primarily supported by internal forecasts as compared to unamortized costs where an evaluation indicates unamortized costs including advances on multiyear sports rights contracts are not recoverable amortization of rights is accelerated in an amount equal to the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed fair value owned programming is monetized and tested for impairment on an individual basis licensed programming is predominately monetized as a group and tested for impairment on a channel network or daypart basis the recoverability of certain sports rights is assessed on an aggregate basis the company recognized impairments of approximately 50 million nil and 95 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively related to licensed and owned programming at the cable network programming and television segments which were recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

the companys intangible assets include goodwill federal communications commission fcc licenses traditional mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships software trademarks and other copyrighted products 

the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets acquired based on their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment the companys impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach that requires significant management judgment the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the company to perform an interim impairment test 

the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires among other inputs the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations this method also involves the use of managements judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the us broadcast industry the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these longterm assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material 

during fiscal 2022 the company determined that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2022 were not impaired based on the companys annual assessment while the company believes its judgments represent reasonably possible outcomes based on available facts and circumstances adverse changes to the assumptions including those related to macroeconomic factors comparable public company trading values and prevailing conditions in the capital markets could lead to future declines in the fair value of a reporting unit in the other corporate and eliminations segment and a potential noncash goodwill impairment charge the estimated fair value of this 

reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow analysis and the market approach which incorporates the use of revenue multiples based on market data fair value exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit by less than 20 as of june 30 2022 further adverse changes in market conditions may result in a partial or full impairment of the approximately 250 million of goodwill in this reporting unit as of june 30 2022 the company determined that there are no other reporting units at risk of impairment as of june 30 2022 and will continue to monitor its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for any possible future noncash impairment charges 

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading annual impairment review for further discussion 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income tax primarily in various domestic jurisdictions the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the companys tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740 income taxes 

the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in making this assessment management analyzes future taxable income reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 

employee costs 

the company participates in andor sponsors various pension savings and postretirement benefit plans pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements the measurement and recognition of costs of the companys pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions 

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality the company considers current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions the expected longterm rate of return is determined using the current target asset allocation of 35 equity securities 55 fixed income securities and 10 in other investments and applying expected future returns for the various asset classes and correlations amongst the asset classes a portion of the fixed income investments is allocated to cash to pay nearterm benefits 

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixed income investments on the companys annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the companys expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds 

the key assumptions used in developing the companys fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following 



discount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date the company will utilize discount rates of 48 and 45 in calculating the fiscal 2023 service cost and interest cost respectively for its plans the company will use an expected longterm rate of return of 50 for fiscal 2023 based principally on the future return expectation of the plans asset mix the accumulated pretax net losses on the companys pension and postretirement benefit plans as of june 30 2022 were 292 million which decreased from 424 million as of june 30 2021 this decrease of 132 million was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption utilized in measuring plan obligations updates to other valuation assumptions and the recognition of deferred losses related to amortization partially offset by asset losses the overall accumulated pretax net losses as of june 30 2022 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates higher discount rates decrease the present value of benefit obligations and reduce the companys accumulated net loss which decreases the amortization component of subsequentyear pension expense lower discount rates increase the present value of benefit obligations and increase the companys accumulated net loss which increases the amortization component of subsequentyear pension expense these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715 compensation—retirement benefits unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation pbo are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants 

the company made contributions of 59 million 63 million and 30 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the companys expected plan returns in fiscal 2023 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status 

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the companys expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the companys pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 



fiscal 2023 net periodic pension expense for the companys pension plans is expected to increase to approximately 65 million primarily due to asset losses during fiscal 2022 and an increase in interest costs due to higher discount rates

government regulation 

the communications act and fcc regulation

the television broadcast industry in the us is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various agencies including the fcc the fcc regulates television broadcasting and certain aspects of the operations of cable satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting pursuant to the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act”  the introduction of new laws and regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the operations prospects and financial performance of the company

broadcast licenses the communications act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the company owns broadcast licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations under the communications act television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse fox television stations currently has renewal applications pending for its full power broadcast licenses and will continue filing license renewal applications through calendar year 2023 

ownership regulations under the fcc’s national television ownership rule one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39 of all us television households subject to the uhf discount under the uhf discount a uhf television station is attributed with reaching only 50 of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach in december 2017 the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying retaining or eliminating the 39 national television audience reach limitation including the uhf discount if the fcc determines in the future to eliminate the uhf discount and the national television audience reach limitation is not eliminated or modified the company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be negatively affected 

in a reconsideration order issued in november 2017 the fcc eliminated the newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule which prohibited common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers in the same market the company owns two television stations in the new york dma and an attributable interest in the new york post due to the murdoch family trust’s ownership interests in news corporation “news corp” the stations operated under waivers of the crossownership rule prior to its elimination in 2019 the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit” vacated the 2017 reconsideration order and the crossownership rule was reinstated the fcc filed a petition for review with the united states supreme court the “supreme court” in april 2020 and in april 2021 the supreme court reversed the third circuit in a unanimous decision as a result common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers is no longer prohibited additionally in the 2017 reconsideration order the fcc eliminated a prior prohibition against owning two of the top four ranked stations in a dma but such ownership remains subject to fcc review and approval and one party may not own more than two television stations in the same dma

the company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership for example fcc dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — fox abc cbs and nbc — from being under common ownership or control in addition under the communications act no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country this ownership limit can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest the fcc could review the company’s compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of fox television stations’ license renewal applications the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the company’s board of directors to take action to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder

carriage and content regulations fcc regulations require each television broadcaster to elect at threeyear intervals either to require carriage of its signal by traditional mvpds in the station’s market or to negotiate the terms through which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional mvpds within its market 

 

which we refer to as the retransmission consent f ox television stations ha ve historically elected retransmission consent for all of their owned and operated stations and the company has been compensated as a result  

federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 ½ minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week in addition under fcc regulations television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming which among other requirements must serve as a “significant purpose” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under under fcc rules that were revised in 2019 one of the three hours per week may air on a television’s station’s multicast streams the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream a television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions including monetary fines and the possible nonrenewal of its license

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 600 am and 1000 pm federal law currently authorizes the fcc to impose fines of up to 419533 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts the fcc may impose fines or revoke licenses for serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition because indecency complaints are confidential there may be pending nonpublic complaints alleging the broadcast of indecent or profane material by fox television stations and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints

modifications to the company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of fox television stations and the fox network if indecency regulation is extended to internet or cable and satellite programming and such extension was found to be constitutional some of the company’s other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels

the fcc continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification political advertising children’s television environmental concerns equal employment opportunity technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance in addition the federal trade commission or ftc has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices particularly with respect to social media marketing both fcc and ftc rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser

fcc rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming in addition federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 70 largest markets to carry a specified minimum amount of hours of primetime or children’s programming per calendar quarter with audio descriptions ie a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel the same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via internet protocol apps or services

fcc regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations including among other things a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance

violation of fcc regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures periodic reporting conditions shortterm license renewals and in egregious cases denial of license renewal or revocation of license violation of ftcimposed obligations can result in enforcement actions litigation consent decrees and ultimately substantial monetary fines

broadcast transmission standard in november 2017 the fcc adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “next generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the advanced television systems committee inc also referred to as “atsc 30” fox television stations is actively building out atsc 30 facilities fox television stations is participating in various atsc 30 testing with other broadcasters but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the company’s operations in june 2020 the fcc adopted a declaratory ruling and notice of proposed rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to nonvideo services the notice of proposed rulemaking raises a number of questions that could impact the adoption and rollout of both video and nonvideo atsc 30 services 

 

privacy and information regulation 

the laws and regulations governing the collection use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving particularly as they relate to the company’s digital businesses federal and state laws and regulations affecting the company’s online services websites and other business activities include the children’s online privacy protection act which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or “spam” the video privacy protection act which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider” the telephone consumer protection act which restricts certain marketing communications such as text messages and calls without explicit consent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the collection handling disclosure and use of certain personal information by companies that offer consumers financial products or services imposes notice obligations and provides certain individual rights regarding the use and disclosure of certain information and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which imposes broad obligations on the collection use handling and disclosure of personal information of california residents for example subject to certain exceptions the ccpa provides individual rights for californians including to access delete and to restrict the “sale” of personal information

a number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection maintenance and use of personal information breach notification requirements and cybersecurity are pending or have been adopted at the state and federal level which would impose additional obligations on businesses for example the california privacy rights act the “cpra” which amends the ccpa was passed in november 2020 and generally takes effect on january 1 2023 among other things the cpra creates a new state privacy protection agency expands individual rights and introduces new requirements for businesses several which are subject to additional rulemaking other states have passed or introduced similar privacy legislation including virginia and colorado in addition the ftc and state attorneys general and other regulators have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus other federal and state laws and regulations also may be adopted that impact our digital services including those relating to oversight of usergenerated content

foreign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations that apply to certain of the company’s operations it is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations the eu general data protection regulation in particular regulates the collection use and security of personal data and restricts the transborder flow of such data other countries including canada australia china and mexico also have enacted data protection legislation

the company monitors and considers these laws and regulations particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs these laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change and could result in increased compliance costs claims financial penalties for noncompliance changes to business practices including with respect to tailored advertising or otherwise impact the company’s business violations of these laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties private litigation require us to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address and harm our reputation even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation

risk factors

tableend

prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the company’s securities

risks related to macroeconomic conditions our business and our industry

the covid19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the company’s business weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets pose risks to the company and its business partners including advertisers whose expenditures tend to reflect overall economic conditions although the covid19 pandemic did not cause a significant reduction in the company’s advertisers’ spending in fiscal 2021 future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could negatively impact their advertising expenditures further to date the company has not experienced meaningful subscriber declines due to the pandemic however there could be industrywide changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic such as increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services that could adversely affect the company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues

the company’s business depends on the volume and popularity of the content it distributes particularly sports content as a result of the covid19 pandemic there have been cancellations or postponements of live sports events to which the company has broadcast rights and suspensions of the production of certain entertainment content these content disruptions have adversely affected the company’s advertising and affiliate revenues and there could be additional adverse impacts on its advertising or affiliate fee revenues in the future to the extent the covid19 or other pandemic further negatively impacts the timing of or the company’s ability to air sports events particularly mlb nfl or college sports it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations than the company has experienced thus far

if there is a significant decline in the company’s estimated revenues or the expected popularity of its programming it could lead to a downward revision in the value of among other things the company’s reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets programming rights and longlived assets and result in a noncash impairment charge that is material to the company’s reported net earnings

more information about these risks is presented below as well as information about other risks the pandemic may exacerbate such as those relating to data privacy and security legal and regulatory changes damage to the company’s brands and reputation and the ability to realize the strategic goals of the company’s investments the covid19 pandemic also poses risks related to the company’s workforce and operations and those of its business partners for example where possible company employees began working remotely in march 2020 the company expects a portion of its employees will continue to work in a “hybrid” manner onsite and at home which despite the company’s continuing investment in secure technologies and processes may subject the company to increased data security risks as and when employees return to their places of work it poses various risks to the company including compliance and litigation risks these workplace changes have subjected the company to increased operating costs and the company expects to incur additional such costs in the future

the magnitude of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on evolving factors the company may not be able to control or accurately predict these include the duration and scope of the pandemic including the extent of future surges mutations or strains of the disease and the efficacy of vaccination and other efforts to contain the virus or treat its impact the duration and extent of the pandemic’s impact on global and regional economies and economic activity the pace of economic recovery and the economic and operating conditions facing the company and others in the pandemic’s aftermath the effect of governmental actions that have been and may continue to be imposed in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on the health wellbeing and productivity of the company’s employees and the company’s ability to conduct its operations and potential changes in consumer behavior the covid19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

 

changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and distribution platforms may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations  

the ways in which consumers view content and technology and business models in our industry continue to rapidly evolve and new distribution platforms and increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and have affected advertisers’ options for reaching their target audiences consumer preferences have evolved towards digital services and other subscription services and there has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all examples include the convergence of television telecasts and digital delivery of programming to televisions and other devices videoondemand platforms usergenerated content sites and simultaneous streaming of telecast content that allows viewers to consume content on demand and in remote locations while avoiding traditional advertisements or subscription payments as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content there is still to be developed a consistent broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry in addition consumers are increasingly using timeshifting and advertisingblocking technologies that enable them to fastforward or circumvent advertisements substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of the company’s programming to advertisers and adversely affect our advertising revenues

changes in consumer behavior and technology have also had an adverse impact on traditional mvpds that deliver the company’s broadcast and cable networks to consumers consumers are increasingly turning to alternative offerings including svod and avod services and mobile and social media platforms which has contributed to industrywide declines in subscribers to traditional mvpd services over the last several years these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional mvpd subscriptions the company may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for the programming on its traditional linear networks which could lead to lower affiliate fee and advertising revenues changing distribution models may also negatively impact the company’s ability to negotiate affiliation agreements on favorable terms which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our affiliate fee and advertising revenues also may be adversely affected by consumers’ use of antennas and their integration with settop boxes or other consumer devices to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions

to remain competitive in this evolving environment the company must effectively anticipate and adapt to new market changes the company continues to focus on expanding its digital distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers including tubi fox nation and other offerings however if the company fails to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of technological developments and consumer preferences it could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

declines in advertising expenditures could cause the company’s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising and its ability to generate advertising revenues depends on a number of factors the strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries advertisers’ spending priorities and the economy in general or the economy of an individual geographic market in addition pandemics natural and other disasters acts of terrorism and political uncertainties or hostilities can also lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of economic uncertainty disrupted programming and services or reduced advertising spots due to preemptions as described above the covid19 pandemic caused some of the company’s advertisers to reduce their spending in fiscal 2021 which had a negative impact on the company’s advertising revenues

major sports events such as the nfl’s super bowl and the fifa world cup and the state congressional and presidential elections cycles also may cause the company’s advertising revenues to vary substantially from year to year political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on advertising and the competitive nature of the elections affecting viewers in markets featuring our programming

advertising expenditures may also be affected by changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and platforms there is increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences and demand for the company’s programming as measured by ratings points is a key factor in determining the advertising rates as well as the affiliate rates the company receives in addition as described above newer technologies and platforms are increasing the number of 

 

media and entertainment choices available to audiences some of these technologies and platforms allow users to view programming from a remote location or on a timedelayed basis and provide users the ability to fastforward rewind pause and skip programming and advertisements which could negatively affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers the pricing and volume of advertising may also be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly from traditional media or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising such as through automated purchasing dynamic advertising insertion third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the company as traditional advertising methods the company also generates advertising revenues through its tubi avod service the market for avod advertising campaigns is relatively new and evolving and if this market develops slower or differently than we expect it could adversely affect our advertising revenues declines in advertising revenues may also be caused by regulatory intervention or other third party action that impacts where and when advertising may be placed 

advertising sales also largely depend on audience measurement and could be negatively affected if measurement methodologies do no not accurately reflect actual viewership levels although nielsen’s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement methodology used for our linear television advertising sales we measure and monetize our digital platforms based on a combination of internal and thirdparty data including demographic composite estimates a consistent broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry remains to be developed although we expect multiplatform measurement innovation and standards to benefit us as the video advertising market continues to evolve we are still partially dependent on third parties to provide these solutions

a decrease in advertising expenditures reduced demand for the company’s programming or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the company’s content on all platforms could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

because the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of distributors the failure to enter into or renew affiliation and carriage agreements on favorable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

the company depends on affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable it to reach a large percentage of households through mvpds and third partyowned television stations the inability to enter into or renew mvpd arrangements on favorable terms or at all or the loss of carriage on mvpds’ basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the company’s owned and operated television stations and broadcast and cable networks which could adversely affect the company’s revenues from affiliate fees and its ability to sell national and local advertising time the loss of favorable mvpd packaging positioning pricing or other marketing opportunities could also negatively impact the company’s revenues from affiliate fees these risks are exacerbated by consolidation among traditional mvpds their increased vertical integration into the cable or broadcast network business and their use of alternative technologies to offer their subscribers access to local broadcast network programming which have provided traditional mvpds with greater negotiating leverage in addition if the company and an mvpd reach an impasse in contract renewal negotiations the company’s networks and owned and operated television stations could become unavailable to the mvpd’s subscribers ie “go dark” which depending on the length of time and the size of the mvpd could have a negative impact on the company’s revenues from affiliate fees and advertising

the company also depends on the maintenance of affiliation agreements and license agreements with third partyowned television stations to distribute the fox network and mynetworktv in markets where the company does not own television stations consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage and reduce the number of available distribution partners there can be no assurance that these affiliation and license agreements will be renewed in the future on terms favorable to the company the inability to enter into affiliation or licensing arrangements with thirdparty owned television stations on favorable terms could reduce distribution of the fox network and mynetworktv and the inability to enter into such affiliation or licensing arrangements for the fox network on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s affiliate fee revenues and its ability to sell national advertising time

in addition the company has arrangements through which it makes its content available for viewing through thirdparty online video platforms if these arrangements are not renewed on favorable or commercially reasonable terms or at all it could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results

 

if the number of subscribers to mvpd services continues to decline or such declines accelerate the company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues could be negatively affected 

as described above changes in technology and consumer behavior have contributed to industrywide declines in the number of subscribers to mvpd services which have had a negative impact on the number of subscribers to the company’s networks these industrywide subscriber declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future the majority of the company’s affiliation agreements with mvpds are multiyear contracts that provide for payments to the company that are based in part on the number of mvpd subscribers covered by the agreement if declines in the number of mvpd subscribers are not fully offset by affiliate rate increases the company’s affiliate fee revenues will be negatively affected because mvpd subscriber losses could also decrease the potential audience for the company’s networks which is a critical factor affecting both the pricing and volume of advertising future mvpd subscriber declines could also adversely impact the company’s advertising revenues

the company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets

the us economy has experienced a period of weakness due to the covid19 pandemic which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending habits political and sociopolitical uncertainties and potential changes in trade relationships between the us and other countries the company also faces risks associated with the impact of weak economic conditions on advertisers affiliates suppliers wholesale distributors retailers insurers and others with which it does business

increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time and we cannot guarantee that the company will be able to refinance outstanding indebtedness or obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to the company or at all in addition the company’s access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the company’s shortterm and longterm debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies if we are not successful in obtaining financing or incur significantly higher borrowing costs than contemplated it may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the company’s lenders insurers customers and counterparties including vendors retailers and other partners for instance the inability of the company’s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the company and lead to negative effects on the company including business disruptions decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses

the company’s businesses operate in a highly competitive industry

the company competes with other companies for highquality content to reach large audiences and to generate advertising revenue the company also competes for distribution on mvpds and other thirdparty digital platforms the company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular programming and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms which are increasing the number of content choices available to audiences the consolidation of advertising agencies distributors and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and made competition for audiences advertising revenue and distribution more intense competition for audiences andor advertising comes from a variety of sources including broadcast television networks cable television systems and networks internetdelivered platforms such as live streaming svod and avod services and mobile gaming and social media platforms audio programming and print and other media other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the company’s stations or networks or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns increased competition in the acquisition of programming may also affect the scope of rights we are able to acquire and the cost of such rights and the future value of the rights we acquire or retain cannot be predicted with certainty entering into or renewing contracts for programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in increased costs to the company with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on mvpds for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from acquired rights contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of 

 

producing and distributing the programming there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on the popularity of special sports events and the continued popularity of the sports leagues and teams for which we have programming rights

our sports business depends on the popularity and success of the sports franchises leagues and teams for which we have acquired broadcast and cable network programming rights if a sports league declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm this may negatively impact viewership and advertising and affiliate fee revenues received in connection with our sports programming our operating results may be impacted in part by special events such as the nfl’s super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks the mlb’s world series and the fifa world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sports events delivered to consumers on our broadcast television and cable networks our advertising and affiliate fee revenues are subject to fluctuations based on the dates of sports events and their availability for viewing through our broadcast television and cable networks and the popularity of the competing teams for example any decrease in the number of postseason games played in a sports league for which we have acquired broadcast programming rights or the participation of a smallermarket sports franchise in postseason competition could result in lower advertising revenues for the company there can be no assurance that any sports league will continue to generate fan enthusiasm or provide the expected number of regular and postseason games for advertisers and customers and the failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally increased competition for the sale of sports event advertising time with other television networks stations and other advertising platforms such as digital media audio and print may adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results a shortfall in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the company has acquired rights or in the volume of sports programming the company expects to distribute could adversely affect the company’s advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate fee revenues

the inability to renew programming rights particularly sports programming rights on sufficiently favorable terms or at all could cause the company’s advertising and affiliate fee revenues to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sports events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors programming rights agreements retransmission consent agreements carriage contracts and affiliation agreements have varying durations and renewal terms that are subject to negotiation with other parties the outcome of which is unpredictable in addition competition for popular programming rights and sports programming rights in particular that are licensed from third parties is intense and the licenses have varying duration and renewal terms moreover the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions andor league agreements that we may not be able to control including a decision to alter the number frequency and timing of regular and postseason games played during a season as these contracts expire we may seek renewals on favorable terms however third parties may outbid us for the rights contracts the loss of rights or renewal on less favorable terms could impact the quality or quantity of the company’s programs in particular the sports coverage offered by the company its cable networks broadcast stations and affiliates to the fox network and could adversely affect the company’s advertising and affiliate fee revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising and affiliate fee revenues in addition if the company does not obtain exclusive rights to the programming it distributes it could negatively impact the company’s advertising and affiliate fee revenues

acceptance of the company’s content by the public is difficult to predict which could lead to fluctuations in revenues

television distribution is a speculative business since the revenues derived from the distribution of content depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public which is difficult to predict low public acceptance of the company’s content will adversely affect the company’s results of operations the commercial success of our programming also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programming the growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in programming and the acquisition of sports rights before we learn the extent to which the content will earn consumer acceptance competition for popular content particularly sports and entertainment 

 

programming is intense and the company may need to increase the price it pays for popular content rights the company’s failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content or a decline in the ratings or popularity of the company’s news sports or entertainment television programming which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming could adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate fee revenues 

damage to our brands particularly the fox brand or our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our brands particularly the fox brand are among our most valuable assets we believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business maintaining further enhancing and extending our brands may require us to make significant investments in marketing programming or new products services or events these investments may not be successful we may introduce new programming that is not popular with our consumers and advertisers which may negatively affect our brands to the extent our content in particular our live news and sports programming and primetime entertainment programming is not compelling to consumers our ability to maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted governmental scrutiny and fines and significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations content products management employees practices advertisers business partners and culture including individuals associated with content we create or license may damage the company’s reputation and brands even if such claims are untrue furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted if we are not successful in maintaining or enhancing the image or awareness of our brands or if our reputation is harmed for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our investments in new businesses products services and technologies through acquisitions and other strategic investments present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we had contemplated which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have acquired and invested in and expect to continue acquiring and investing in new businesses products services and technologies that complement enhance or expand our current businesses or otherwise offer us growth opportunities such acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from an investment to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the investment a failure of the investment or acquired business to perform as expected meet financial projections or achieve strategic goals a failure to further develop an acquired business product service or technology unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to not realize anticipated benefits or to incur unanticipated liabilities difficulties in integrating the operations personnel technologies and systems of acquired businesses the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses the diversion of management attention from current operations and compliance with new regulatory regimes because acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and their anticipated benefits or value may not materialize our acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

the loss of key personnel including talent could disrupt the management or operations of the company’s business and adversely affect its revenues

the company’s business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of its chairman k rupert murdoch and executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch and other key employees and news sports and entertainment personalities the company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company including the impairment of the company’s ability to execute successfully its business strategy additionally the company employs or independently contracts with several news sports and entertainment personalities with significant loyal audiences news sports and entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of programming on a television station or cable network and therefore a significant influence on the ability of the station or network to sell advertising the company’s broadcast television stations and cable networks deliver programming with highly regarded onair talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for the distributed news sports and entertainment content there can be no assurance that these news sports and entertainment personalities will remain with us or retain their current appeal or that the costs associated with retaining this and new talent will be favorable or acceptable to us if the company fails to retain or attract these personalities and talent or they lose their current audiences or advertising partners the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

 

labor disputes involving our own employees or those at businesses we depend o n may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in a variety of the company’s businesses the company and its partners engage the services of trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or reducing profit margins moreover the company has certain collective bargaining agreements which are industrywide agreements and the company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements in dispute

in addition our broadcast television and cable networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports leagues to broadcast and produce sports events including certain college football and basketball nfl and mlb games any labor disputes that occur in any sports league for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events resulting in decreased revenues which could adversely affect our business revenue and results of operations

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill intangible assets and programming

the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including fcc licenses the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and other longlived assets any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of our programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets programming rights investments or longlived assets could result in a noncash impairment charge any such charge could be material to the company’s reported net earnings

risks relating to cybersecurity piracy privacy and data protection

the degradation failure or misuse of the company’s network and information systems and other technology could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data or other confidential information resulting in increased costs liabilities or loss of revenue

cloud services content delivery and other networks information systems and other technologies that we or our vendors or other partners use including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our content the “systems” are critical to our business activities and shutdowns or disruptions of and cybersecurity attacks on the systems pose increasing risks disruptions to the systems such as computer hacking and phishing theft computer viruses ransomware worms or other destructive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks or other malicious activities as well as power outages natural or other disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may affect the systems and could result in disruption of our services misappropriation misuse alteration theft loss leakage falsification and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure of confidential or other information including intellectual property and personal data of third parties employees and users of our streaming services and other digital properties contained on the systems while we continue to develop implement and maintain security measures seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of the systems such efforts are costly require ongoing monitoring and updating and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and become more sophisticated and targeted in addition the company’s recovery and business continuity plans may not be adequate to address any cybersecurity incidents that occur the company’s high profile sports and entertainment programming and its extensive news coverage of elections sociopolitical events and public controversies subject us to heightened cybersecurity risks although no cybersecurity incident has been material to the company’s businesses to date we expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material incident any cybersecurity incidents could result in a disruption of our operations customer or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to our reputation or brands regulatory investigations claims lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue and the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any incidents the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur

 

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and signal theft and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights

content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the company’s revenues from products and services including television shows cable and other programming the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy as well as cable and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft however policing unauthorized use of the company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement developments in technology including digital copying file compression technology growing penetration of highbandwidth internet connections increased availability and speed of mobile data networks and new devices and applications that enable unauthorized access to content increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to access duplicate widely distribute and store highquality pirated material in addition developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of usergenerated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content including those emanating from other countries in various languages may adversely impact the company’s businesses the proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the company’s content could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services

the company takes a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft both individually and in some instances together with industry associations but the protection of the company’s intellectual property rights depends on the scope and duration of the company’s rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and how those laws are construed if those laws are interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase a change in the laws of one jurisdiction may also have an impact on the company’s overall ability to protect its intellectual property rights across other jurisdictions the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property may not be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft further while piracy and the proliferation of piracyenabling technology tools continue to escalate if any laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed weakened or not adequately enforced or if the applicable legal systems fail to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase

the company is subject to complex laws regulations rules industry standards and contractual obligations related to privacy and personal data protection which are evolving inconsistent and potentially costly

we are subject to us federal and state laws as well as laws from other countries relating to the collection use disclosure and security of personal information for example the california consumer privacy act imposes broad obligations on businesses’ collection use handling and disclosure of personal information of california residents and imposes fines for noncompliance the eu and other countries also have privacy and data security legislation with significant penalties for violations that apply to certain of the company’s operations new privacy and data protection laws continue to be introduced and interpretations of existing privacy laws some of which may be inconsistent with one another continue to evolve although the company expends significant resources to comply with privacy and data protection laws we may be subject to regulatory or other legal action despite these efforts any such action could result in damage to our reputation or brands loss of customers or revenue and other negative impacts to our operations the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any claims the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur for more information see item 1 “government regulation – privacy and information regulation”

risks relating to legal and regulatory matters

changes in us communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

the company is subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate in general the television broadcasting and traditional mvpd industries in the us are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc the fcc generally regulates among other things the ownership of media broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees for example the company is required to apply for and operate in compliance with licenses from the fcc to 

 

operate a television station purchase a new television station or sell an existing television station with licenses generally subject to an eightyear renewable term our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including those relating to issues such as content regulation user privacy and data protection and consumer protection  further the united states congress the fcc and state legislatures currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes and measures relating to network neutrality privacy and data security which could directly or indirectly affect the operations and ownership of the company’s media properties any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the company’s advertising revenues in addition some policymakers maintain that traditional mvpds should be required to offer a la carte programming to subscribers on a network by network basis or “family friendly” programming tiers unbundling packages of program services may increase both competition for carriage on distribution platforms and marketing expenses which could adversely affect the business financial condition and results of operations of the company’s cable networks the threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue similarly new federal or state laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of federal or state law or in regulations imposed by the us government could require changes in the operations or ownership of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the company may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities including under fcc rules and policies or delays in our renewal and other applications with the fcc

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm the fcc has indicated that in addition to issuing fines to licensees it would consider initiating license revocation proceedings for “serious” indecency violations we air a significant amount of live news reporting and live sports coverage on our broadcast television stations and networks and a portion of our content is under the control of our onair talent the company cannot predict whether information delivered by our stations and onair talent could violate fcc rules related to indecency which had been found to be unconstitutionally vague by the us supreme court especially given the spontaneity of live news and sports programming violation of the fcc’s indecency rules could subject us to government investigation penalties license revocation or renewal or qualification proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the ability of nonus citizens and certain other persons to invest in us

the company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of us television stations under the communications act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the communications act and the fcc rules without the fcc’s prior approval no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of its stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to take action to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder we are currently in compliance with applicable us law and continue to monitor our foreign ownership based on our assessment of the information reasonably available to us but we are not able to predict whether we will need to take action pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the fcc could review the company’s compliance with applicable us law in connection with its consideration of the company’s renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the company owns

the failure or destruction of satellites or transmitter facilities the company depends on to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect its businesses and results of operations as could changes in fcc regulations governing the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum

the company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption occurs failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses and results of operations each of the company’s television stations and cable 

 

networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses and results of operations further changes in fcc regulations have reduced the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum in 2020 the fcc began re allocat ing and “repacking” a band of satellite transmission spectrum known as the “cband” used by the television industry to transmit programming in order to free up spectrum for the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services  this has reduced the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum for the television industry and additional changes in fcc regulations could lead to further reduc tions  the decreased availability of satellite transmission spectrum could diminish the quality of and increase interference to our transmissions  which could significantly hinder the company’s ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds 

the company could be subject to significant tax liabilities

we are subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations practices or the interpretations thereof including changes in legislation currently being considered could affect the company’s results of operations judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes in addition transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain

tax returns are routinely audited taxrelated litigation or settlements may occur and certain jurisdictions may assess income tax liabilities against us the final outcomes of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our historical tax provisions and accruals these outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings opinions of counsel or other interpretations provided to the company if these matters are adversely resolved we may be required to recognize additional charges to our tax provisions and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures

we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits including claims relating to competition intellectual property rights employment and labor matters personal injury and property damage free speech customer privacy regulatory requirements and advertising marketing and selling practices greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards including any related investigations and litigation we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses results of operations or financial condition

risks relating to our ownership structure

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in news corp or because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of news corp

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of common stock of news corporation which we refer to as news corp and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of news corp including our chairman k rupert murdoch who serves as news corp’s executive chairman and our executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch who serves as news corp’s cochairman this ownership of or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for news corp and the company in addition to any other arrangements that the company and news corp may agree to implement the company and news corp have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies

our amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that our directors and officers as well as certain of our stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of news corp and the company each of which we refer to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of news corp and certain of its affiliates our amended and restated bylaws provide that any such overlapping 

 

person will not be liable to us or to any of our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity to news corp instead of us the provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities to news corp instead of us 

certain provisions of the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws delaware law the company’s stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval

the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things















these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals desirable

further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the outstanding fox class a common stock and 406 of fox class b common stock k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional less than one percent of fox class b common stock and 15 of fox class a common stock thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate 15 of fox class a common stock and 412 of fox class b common stock 

this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of fox class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of fox class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement prevents unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

the company’s board of directors has approved a 4 billion stock repurchase program for the fox class a common stock and fox class b common stock which could increase the percentage of fox class b common stock held by the murdoch family trust the company has entered into a stockholders agreement with the murdoch family trust pursuant to which the company and the murdoch family trust have agreed not to take actions that would result in the 

 

murdoch family trust and murdoch family members together owning more than 44 of the outstanding voting power of the shares of fox class b common stock or would increase the murdoch family trust’s voting power by more than 175 in any rolling 12month period the murdoch family trust would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the murdoch family trust and the murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44 of the outstanding voting power of the class b shares except where a murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the murdoch family trust on any matter 

risks related to the company’s separation from 21cf

the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits it expects to achieve as a standalone publicly traded company

following the transaction the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than the company would have otherwise been while it was still part of 21cf as part of 21cf the company enjoyed certain benefits from 21cf’s scale operating diversity and access to capital which are no longer available as a standalone publicly traded company we expect to benefit from among other things sharpened focus on the financial and operational resources of the company’s businesses which allows management to design and implement a capital structure corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic opportunities of the fox businesses we believe this will allow us to respond more effectively to industry dynamics and to create effective incentives for management and employees that are more closely tied to fox’s business performance if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a standalone publicly traded company or such benefits are delayed our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of the separation t he company is in the process of completing an upgrade to its systems including information technology if the company is unable to successfully complete the upgrade to its systems the company’s ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules applicable to public companies could be impaired and the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

the company has a limited operating history as a standalone publicly traded company and the company’s historical financial information for periods prior to the date of the transaction is not necessarily representative of the results the company would have achieved as a standalone publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of the company’s future results

the company derived the historical financial information for periods prior to the date of the transaction the “pretransaction periods” from 21cf’s consolidated financial statements and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position the company would have achieved as a standalone publicly traded company during the pretransaction periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future this is primarily because of the following factors







therefore the company’s historical financial statements relating to the pretransaction periods may not be indicative of the company’s performance as a standalone publicly traded company

 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21cf in connection with the transaction may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21cf the indemnification from 21cf may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities that have been allocated to 21cf 

pursuant to the agreements the company and 21cf entered into in connection with the transaction 21cf will indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company will indemnify 21cf for certain liabilities payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities of the businesses that were retained by 21cf in connection with the transaction 21cf has agreed to indemnify the company for such liabilities but such indemnity from 21cf may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities and 21cf may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from 21cf any amounts for which it is held liable the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21cf

each member of the 21cf consolidated group which prior to the transaction included 21cf the company and 21cf’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income and in certain jurisdictions state tax liabilities of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the transaction consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of what was previously the 21cf consolidated group the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the transaction requires 21cf andor disney to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify

introduction

the distribution

on march 19 2019 the company became a standalone publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by twentyfirst century fox inc now known as tfcf corporation “21cf” of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fox to 21cf stockholders other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21cf the “distribution” in accordance with the amended and restated distribution agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20 2018 by and between 21cf and 21cf distribution merger sub inc following the distribution 354 million and 266 million shares of the company’s class a common stock par value 001 per share the “class a common stock” and class b common stock par value 001 per share the “class b common stock” and together with the class a common stock the “common stock” respectively began trading independently on the nasdaq global select market in connection with the distribution the company entered into the separation and distribution agreement dated as of march 19 2019 the “separation agreement” with 21cf which effected the internal restructuring the “separation” whereby 21cf transferred to fox a portfolio of 21cf’s news sports and broadcast businesses including fox news media consisting of fox news and fox business fox entertainment fox sports fox television stations and sports cable networks fs1 fs2 fox deportes and big ten network and certain other assets and fox assumed from 21cf the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities the separation and the distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the amended and restated merger agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20 2018 the “21cf disney merger agreement” by and among 21cf the walt disney company “disney” and certain subsidiaries of disney pursuant to which among other things 21cf became a whollyowned subsidiary of disney 

pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement immediately prior to the distribution the company paid to 21cf a dividend in the amount of 85 billion the “dividend” the final determination of the taxes in respect of the separation and the distribution for which the company is responsible pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement and a prepayment of the estimated taxes in respect of divestitures collectively the “transaction tax” was 65 billion following the distribution on march 20 2019 the company received a cash payment in the amount of 20 billion from disney which had the net effect of reducing the dividend the company paid to 21cf the transaction tax included a prepayment of the company’s share of the estimated tax liabilities resulting from the anticipated divestitures by disney of certain assets principally the fox sports regional sports networks “rsns” which were sold by disney during calendar year 2019 this prepayment was in the amount of approximately 700 million and is subject to adjustment in the future when the actual amounts of all such tax liabilities are reported on the federal income tax returns of disney or a subsidiary of disney any such adjustment is not expected to have a material impact on the results of the company during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the company and disney reached an agreement to settle the majority of the prepaid divestiture tax and the company received 462 million from disney as reimbursement of the company’s prepayment based upon the sales price of the rsns this reimbursement was recorded in other net in the statement of operations see note 21 — additional financial information to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “other net” 

as a result of the separation and the distribution which was a taxable transaction for which the estimated tax liability of 58 billion was included in the transaction tax paid by the company fox obtained a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values this resulted in estimated annual tax deductions of approximately 15 billion principally over the next several years related to the amortization of the additional tax basis this amortization is estimated to reduce the company’s annual cash tax liability by 370 million per year at the current combined federal and state applicable tax rate of approximately 25 such estimates are subject to revisions which could be material based upon the occurrence of future events including among other things a refund of the prepayment discussed above 

in connection with the separation the company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the company’s relationship with 21cf and disney following the separation these include the separation agreement a tax matters agreement transition services agreements as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses employee matters commercial arrangements and the fox studio lot lease the core transition services agreements will 

 

terminate in accordance with their terms by september 2021 see note 1 — description of business and basis of presentation to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “the distribution” for additional information 

basis of presentation

the company’s financial statements as of and for the years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 are presented on a consolidated basis the company’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 reflect the company’s results of operations and cash flows as a standalone company and the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2021 and 2020 consist of the company’s consolidated balances

prior to the distribution which occurred on march 19 2019 the company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21cf these financial statements reflect the combined historical results of operations financial position and cash flows of 21cf’s domestic news national sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets and liabilities associated with such businesses  

the consolidated and combined statements of operations for the year ended june 30 2019 include for the periods prior to march 19 2019 allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within 21cf prior to the distribution and not recorded at the business unit level such as certain expenses related to finance legal insurance information technology compliance and human resources management activities among others 21cf did not routinely allocate these costs to any of its business units these expenses were allocated to fox on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of combined revenues headcount or other relevant measures management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21cf are reasonable nevertheless the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by fox and may not reflect fox’s consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the entirety of the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if fox had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations this discussion is organized as follows











 



overview of the company’s business

the company is a news sports and entertainment company which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments







the company’s cable network programming and television segments derive the majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales for fiscal 2021 the company generated revenues of 129 billion of which approximately 50 was generated from affiliate fees approximately 42 was generated from advertising and approximately 8 was generated from other operating activities

affiliate fees primarily include i monthly subscriberbased license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry our cable networks and our owned and operated television stations and ii fees received from nonowned and operated television stations that are affiliated with the fox network us law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from traditional mvpds that carry the company’s broadcast signals

the company’s revenues are impacted by rate changes changes in the number of subscribers to the company’s content and changes in the expenditures by advertisers in addition advertising revenues are subject to seasonality and cyclicality as a result of the impact of state congressional and presidential elections cycles and special events that air on the company’s networks including the national football league’s “nfl” super bowl which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks and the fédération internationale de football association “fifa” world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sports events including one nfl divisional playoff game that is aired on a rotating annual basis with another network

the cable network programming and television industries continue to evolve rapidly with changes in technology leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content consumer preferences have evolved toward alternative offerings such as subscription videoondemand “svod” services avod services mobile and social media platforms these changes in technologies and consumer behavior have contributed to declines in the number of subscribers to traditional mvpd services and these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future

at the same time technological changes have affected advertisers’ options for reaching their target audiences there has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content there is still to be developed a consistent broadly accepted measure of multiplatform audiences across the industry furthermore the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending from more traditional media and toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising

the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is dependent to a large extent on the impact of changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies the sale of advertising the maintenance renewal and terms of its carriage affiliation and content agreements and programming rights the popularity of its content general economic conditions including financial market conditions the company’s ability to manage its businesses effectively and its relative strength and leverage in the industry for more information see item 1 “business” and item 1a “risk factors” included herein

nongaap financial measures

adjusted ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses adjusted ebitda does not include amortization of cable distribution investments depreciation and amortization impairment and restructuring charges interest expense interest income other net and income tax expense benefit

adjusted ebitda is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges which are significant components in assessing the company’s financial performance adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

use of estimates

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “use of estimates”

revenue recognition

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment

the company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the company’s network programming to be aired by television networks and cable channels and from sales of broadcast advertising time on the company’s owned and operated television stations and various digital properties advertising revenue from customers primarily advertising agencies is recognized as the commercials are aired certain of the company’s advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views referred to as impressions revenues for any audience deficiencies are deferred until the guaranteed number of impressions is met by providing additional advertisements advertising contracts which are generally shortterm are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month with payments due shortly after the invoice date

the company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with traditional and digital mvpds for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the company’s owned and operated television stations in addition the company generates affiliate fee revenue from agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and receives retransmission consent fees from traditional and digital mvpds for their signals affiliate fee revenue is recognized at a point in time when the network programming is made available to the customer for contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliate’s subscribers revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period for contracts with fixed affiliate fees revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the 

 

contract term which generally reflects the invoiced amount affiliate contracts are generally multiyear contracts with payments due monthly 

the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 606103225 through 27 “revenue recognition—consideration payable to a customer” the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straightline basis over the contract period

programming 

costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing television broadcast network entertainment programming which includes acquired series coproduced series movies and other programs are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its total revenue estimates on a contract basis which may result in a change in the rate of amortization andor a writedown of the asset to fair value

as a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with the company’s programming rights the company recognized writedowns of approximately nil 95 million and 55 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively related to sports entertainment and syndicated programming rights at the cable network programming and television segments which were recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sports events the costs of multiyear national sports contracts at the fox network and the company’s sports channels are primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period’s attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract estimates can change and accordingly are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary such changes in the future could be material the recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on the fox network and the company’s sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company’s intangible assets include goodwill fcc licenses mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income

the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles including goodwill amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method

carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” the company’s impairment review is based on among other methods a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities 

 

loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the company to perform an interim impairment test 

the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires among other inputs the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations this method also involves the use of management’s judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the us broadcast industry the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these longterm assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material

during fiscal 2021 the company determined that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2021 were not impaired the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “annual impairment review” for further discussion

income taxes 

the company is subject to income tax in various domestic jurisdictions the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in making this assessment management analyzes future taxable income reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income

employee costs

the measurement and recognition of costs of the company’s pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions

the company participates in andor sponsors various pension savings and postretirement benefit plans pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements prior to the separation and the distribution certain of the company’s employees participated in defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by 21cf “shared plans” which include participants of other 21cf subsidiaries shared plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans therefore no asset or liability was recorded to recognize the funded status in contemplation of the separation and the distribution the pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities of the shared plans allocable to the company’s employees were transferred to the company in fiscal 2019 see note 15 — pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying financial statements

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality the company considers current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions the expected longterm rate of return is determined using the current target asset allocation of 40  equity securities 48 fixed income securities and 12 in other investments and applying expected future returns for the various asset classes and correlations amongst the asset classes a portion of the other investments is allocated to cash to pay nearterm benefits 

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixed income investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively 

 

settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following

 



 

discount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date the company will utilize discount rates of 28 and 21 in calculating the fiscal 2022 service cost and interest cost respectively for its plans the company will use an expected longterm rate of return of 51 for fiscal 2022 based principally on the future return expectation of the plans’ asset mix the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans as of june 30 2021 were 424 million which decreased from 556 million as of june 30 2020 this decrease of 132 million was primarily due to asset gains and the recognition of deferred losses related to amortization partially offset by the change in discount rate assumption utilized in measuring plan obligations and other changes the overall accumulated pretax net losses as of june 30 2021 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduces the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear pension expense these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation “pbo” are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants

the company made contributions of 63 million 30 million and 83 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2022 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 



 

fiscal 2022 net periodic pension expense for the company’s pension plans is expected to decrease to approximately 50 million primarily due to asset gains during fiscal 2021

goals and strategies

maintain leading positions in live news live sports and quality entertainment

increase revenue growth through the continued delivery of high quality premium and valuable content

with a focused portfolio of assets we create and produce high quality programming that delivers value for our viewers and our affiliate and advertising partners we intend to continue to receive appropriate value for our content particularly through affiliate fees additionally we expect our enhanced ability to acquire independent programming through coproduction arrangements will facilitate growth by enabling us to directly manage the economics and programming decisions of our broadcast network and stations group we also believe our unique ability to deliver “appointmentbased” viewing and audiences at scale along with innovative advertising platforms delivers substantial value to our advertising customers and the unique nature of our “appointmentbased” content positions us to maintain and even grow audiences during a time of increasing consumer fragmentation 

expand our online distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers increasing complementary sources of revenues

government regulation

the communications act and fcc regulation

the television broadcast industry in the us is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various agencies including the fcc the fcc regulates television broadcasting and certain aspects of the operations of cable satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting pursuant to the communications act of 1934 as amended the “communications act”  the introduction of new laws and regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the operations prospects and financial performance of the company 

 

broadcast licenses the communications act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the company owns broadcast licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations under the communications act television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse as of june 30 2020 fox television stations has two pending renewal applications for its television broadcast licenses and is filing license renewal applications for its other stations in calendar years 20202023  

ownership regulations under the fcc’s national television ownership rule one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39 of all us television households subject to the uhf discount under the uhf discount a uhf television station is attributed with reaching only 50 of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach in december 2017 the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying retaining or eliminating the 39 national television audience reach limitation including the uhf discount if the fcc determines in the future to eliminate the uhf discount and the national television audience reach limitation is not eliminated or modified the company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be negatively affected 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule one party may own up to two television stations in the same dma and presumptively only one station ranked among the topfour stations based on audience share as of the application date in november 2017 the fcc issued a reconsideration order that relaxed the local television ownership rule so that among other things station owners could petition the fcc to permit ownership of two stations among the top four in a market as discussed below the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit” vacated the fcc’s order and that decision is on appeal to the us supreme court

in the 2017 fcc reconsideration order the fcc also eliminated the newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule which prohibited common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers in the same market the company owns two television stations in the new york dma and an attributable interest in the new york post due to the murdoch family trust’s ownership interests in news corporation “news corp” the stations operated under waivers of the cross ownership rule prior to its elimination in the fall of 2019 the third circuit vacated the 2017 reconsideration order reinstating the crossownership rule and the fcc implemented the reinstatement in december 2019 the fcc filed a petition for review with the us supreme court in april 2020 and the company also filed a petition for review with other intervenors if the us supreme court affirms the third circuit’s decision reinstating the crossownership rule the company’s operations or future conduct including the acquisition of any broadcast networks or stations or any newspapers in the same local markets in which news corp owns or operates newspapers or has acquired television stations may affect news corp’s ability to own and operate its business in compliance with the rule the 2013 separation agreement between news corp and 21cf the relevant part of which transferred to the company provides that if we acquire newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede news corp’s business then we will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit news corp to hold its media interests and comply with applicable rules

the company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership for example fcc dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — fox abc cbs and nbc — from being under common ownership or control in addition under the communications act no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country this ownership limit can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest the fcc could review the company’s compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of fox television stations’ license renewal applications the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the company’s board of directors to take action to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder 

 

carriage and content regulations fcc regulations require each television broadcaster to elect at threeyear intervals either to require carriage of its signal by traditional mvpds in the station’s market or to negotiate the terms through which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional mvpds within its market which we refer to as the retransmission consent f ox television stations ha ve historically elected retransmission consent for all of their owned and operated stations and the company has been compensated as a result  

federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 ½ minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week in addition under fcc regulations television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming which among other requirements must serve as a “significant purpose” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under under fcc rules that were revised in 2019 one of the three hours per week may air on a television’s station’s multicast streams the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream a television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions including monetary fines and the possible nonrenewal of its license 

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 600 am and 1000 pm federal law currently authorizes the fcc to impose fines of up to 407270 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts the fcc may impose fines or revoke licenses for serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition because indecency complaints are confidential there may be pending nonpublic complaints alleging the broadcast of indecent or profane material by fox television stations and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints

modifications to the company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of fox television stations and the fox network if indecency regulation is extended to internet or cable and satellite programming and such extension was found to be constitutional some of the company’s other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels 

the fcc continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification political advertising children’s television environmental concerns equal employment opportunity technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance in addition the federal trade commission or ftc has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices particularly with respect to social media marketing both fcc and ftc rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser 

fcc rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming in addition federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 60 largest markets to carry a specified minimum amount of hours of primetime or children’s programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions ie a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel the same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via internet protocol apps or services 

fcc regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations including among other things a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance 

violation of fcc regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures periodic reporting conditions shortterm license renewals and in egregious cases denial of license renewal or revocation of license violation of ftcimposed obligations can result in enforcement actions litigation consent decrees and ultimately substantial monetary fines 

cband reallocation in order to free up additional spectrum that will likely be used to provide the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services commonly referred to as 5g services in march 2020 the fcc adopted a report and order that will reallocate through an fcc auction the lower 300 mhz portion of the 500 mhz in the 37 to 42 ghz “cband” the cband forms the backbone of the infrastructure for how the company delivers its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds currently there is no viable scalable and reliable alternative for video delivery if the fcc does not ensure that the interference protection rules it adopted in february 2020 sufficiently safeguard video delivery while it reallocates and “repacks” the cband it would significantly hinder the company’s ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds 

 

broadcast transmission standard  in november 2017 the fcc adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “next generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the advanced television systems committee inc also referred to as “atsc 30” fox television stations is actively planning to build out atsc 30 facilities fox television stations is participating in various atsc 30 testing with other broadcasters but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the company’s operations in june 2020 the fcc adopted a declaratory ruling and notice of proposed rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to nonvideo services the notice of proposed rulemaking raises a number of questions that could impact the adoption and rollout of both video and nonvideo atsc 30 services 

privacy and information regulation

the laws and regulations governing the collection use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving particularly as they relate to the company’s digital businesses federal and state laws and regulations affecting the company’s online services websites and other business activities include the children’s online privacy protection act which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or “spam” the video privacy protection act which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider” the telephone consumer protection act which restricts certain marketing communications such as text messages and calls without explicit consent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the collection handling disclosure and use of certain personal information by companies that offer consumers financial products or services imposes notice obligations and provides certain individual rights regarding the use and disclosure of certain information and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which became effective january 1 2020 and imposes broad new obligations on the collection use and sharing of personal information of california residents for example subject to certain exceptions the ccpa provides new individual rights for californians including to access delete and to restrict the “sale” of personal information 

although the company and the media industry are active in selfregulatory initiatives relating to advertising and online privacy such initiatives may be replaced or superseded by government action a number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection maintenance and use of personal information breach notification requirements and cybersecurity are pending or have been adopted at both the state and federal level including the proposed california privacy rights act ballot initiative which would impose additional obligations on businesses in addition the ftc and state attorneys general have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus

foreign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations some of which may apply to the company’s operations it is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations the eu general data protection regulation in particular regulates the collection use and security of personal data and restricts the transborder flow of such data canada australia and mexico likewise have enacted data protection legislation

the company monitors and considers these privacy and data security laws and regulations particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs these laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change and could result in increased compliance costs claims financial penalties for noncompliance changes to business practices including with respect to tailored advertising or otherwise impact the company’s business for example violations of applicable privacy and data security laws could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties require us to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address and harm our reputation even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation

 

consumer finance laws and regulations 

credible a consumer finance marketplace that fox acquired during fiscal 2020 markets and provides services in heavily regulated industries across the united states as a result credible is subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations these include the laws and regulations governing the collection use and transfer of consumer information described above and the following

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property relying upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including offering legitimate market alternatives deploying digital rights management technologies pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights even if not valid such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations

risk factors

tableend

prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the company’s securities

risks related to the company’s business

the covid19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the company’s business in june 2020 the national bureau of economic research declared that the united states economy has entered a recession weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets pose risks to the company and its business partners including advertisers whose expenditures tend to reflect overall economic conditions the covid19 pandemic has caused some of the company’s advertisers including in particular local market advertisers to reduce their spending and future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could negatively impact their advertising expenditures further depending on the duration and severity of the recession it could lead to changes in consumer behavior including increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services that adversely affect the company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues

the company’s business depends on the volume and popularity of the content it distributes particularly sports content following the covid19 outbreak sports events to which the company has broadcast rights have been cancelled or postponed and the production of certain entertainment content the company acquires has been suspended these content disruptions have adversely affected the company’s advertising revenues and there could be additional adverse impacts on advertising revenues in the future although some of these sports events and productions have resumed or are expected to resume during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 there may be additional content disruptions in the future depending on their duration and severity these disruptions could materially adversely affect the company’s future advertising revenues and over a longer period of time its future affiliate fee revenues to the extent the pandemic further negatively impacts the company’s ability to air sports events particularly mlb nfl or college sports it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations than the company has experienced thus far in addition shifting sports schedules may negatively impact the company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers to its sports and entertainment programming

if there is a significant decline in the company’s estimated revenues or the expected popularity of its programming it could lead to a downward revision in the value of among other things the company’s reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets programming rights and longlived assets and result in a noncash impairment charge that is material to the company’s reported net earnings 

more information about these risks is presented below as well as information about other risks the pandemic may exacerbate such as those relating to data privacy data security legal and regulatory changes damage to the company’s brands and reputation and the ability to realize the strategic goals of the company’s investments the covid19 pandemic also poses risks related to measures aimed at preventing the spread of the virus such as shelter in place orders business shutdowns quarantines and travel bans and restrictions these measures have affected and may further affect the company’s workforce and operations as well as those of its business partners for example where possible company employees began working remotely in march 2020 as and when employees return to their places of work it poses various risks to the company including compliance and litigation risks and subjects the company to increased operating costs relating to efforts to safeguard our employees

the magnitude of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on evolving factors beyond the company’s control these include the duration and extent of the pandemic including whether there is a “secondwave” increases or spikes in the number of cases or future mutations or related strains of the virus the duration and extent of the recession the pace of economic recovery and the economic and operating conditions facing the company and others in the pandemic’s aftermath the effect of governmental actions and potential changes in consumer behavior the covid19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

 

changes in consumer behavior and evolving technologies and distribution platforms may adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations  

the ways in which consumers view content and technology and business models in our industry continue to rapidly evolve and new distribution platforms and increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content and have affected advertisers’ options for reaching their target audiences consumer preferences have evolved towards digital services and other subscription services and there has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all examples include the convergence of television telecasts and digital delivery of programming to televisions and other devices videoondemand platforms usergenerated content sites and simultaneous streaming of telecast content that allows viewers to consume content on demand and in remote locations while avoiding traditional advertisements or subscription payments as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content there is still to be developed a consistent broadly accepted measure of audiences across the industry in addition consumers are increasingly using timeshifting and advertisingblocking technologies that enable them to fastforward or circumvent advertisements substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of the company’s programming to advertisers and adversely affect our advertising revenues

changes in consumer behavior and technology have also had an adverse impact on traditional mvpds that deliver the company’s broadcast and cable networks to consumers consumers are increasingly turning to alternative offerings including svod and avod services and mobile and social media platforms which has contributed to industrywide declines in subscribers to traditional mvpd services over the last several years these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional mvpd subscriptions the company may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for its programming which could lead to lower affiliate fee and advertising revenues changing distribution models may also negatively impact the company’s ability to negotiate affiliation agreements on favorable terms which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our affiliate fee and advertising revenues also may be adversely affected by consumers’ use of antennas and their integration with settop boxes or other consumer devices to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions

to remain competitive in this evolving environment the company must effectively anticipate and adapt to new market changes the company continues to focus on expanding its brands and products beyond traditional linear platforms however if the company fails to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of technological developments and consumer preferences it could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

declines in advertising expenditures could cause the company’s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its cable and broadcast networks and television stations expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns our advertising revenues may vary substantially from year to year driven by major sports events such as the nfl’s super bowl and the fifa world cup and by the state congressional and presidential elections cycles political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising and the competitive nature of the elections impacting viewers in markets featuring our programming declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general can alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences demand for the company’s programming as measured by ratings points is a key factor in determining the advertising rates as well as the affiliate rates the company receives in addition as described above newer technologies and platforms are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences some of these technologies and platforms allow users to view programming from a remote location or on a timedelayed basis and provide users the ability to fastforward rewind pause and skip programming and advertisements which could negatively affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers the pricing and volume of advertising may also be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly from more traditional media or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising such as through automated purchasing dynamic advertising insertion third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the company as traditional advertising methods a decrease in advertising expenditures reduced demand for the company’s programming 

 

or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the company’s content on all platforms could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

the failure to enter into or renew affiliation and carriage agreements on favorable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

the company depends on affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable it to reach a large percentage of households through mvpds and third partyowned television stations the inability to enter into or renew mvpd arrangements on favorable terms or at all or the loss of carriage on mvpds’ basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the company’s owned and operated television stations and broadcast and cable networks which could adversely affect the company’s revenues from affiliate fees and its ability to sell national and local advertising time the loss of favorable mvpd packaging positioning pricing or other marketing opportunities could also negatively impact the company’s revenues from affiliate fees these risks are exacerbated by consolidation among traditional mvpds their increased vertical integration into the cable or broadcast network business and their use of alternative technologies to offer their subscribers access to local broadcast network programming which have provided traditional mvpds with greater negotiating leverage in addition if the company and an mvpd reach an impasse in contract renewal negotiations the company’s networks and owned and operated television stations could become unavailable to the mvpd’s subscribers ie “go dark” which depending on the length of time and the size of the mvpd could have a negative impact on the company’s revenues from affiliate fees and advertising

the company also depends on the maintenance of affiliation agreements and license agreements with third partyowned television stations to distribute the fox network and mynetworktv in markets where the company does not own television stations consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage and reduce the number of available distribution partners there can be no assurance that these affiliation and license agreements will be renewed in the future on terms favorable to the company the inability to enter into affiliation or licensing arrangements with thirdparty owned television stations on favorable terms could reduce distribution of the fox network and mynetworktv and the inability to enter into such affiliation or licensing arrangements for the fox network on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s affiliate fee revenues and its ability to sell national advertising time

in addition the company has arrangements through which it makes its content available for viewing through online video platforms if these arrangements are not renewed on favorable or commercially reasonable terms or at all it could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results

if the number of subscribers to mvpd services continues to decline or such declines accelerate the company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues could be negatively affected

as described above changes in technology and consumer behavior have contributed to industrywide declines in the number of subscribers to mvpd services which have had a negative impact on the number of subscribers to the company’s networks these industrywide subscriber declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future the majority of the company’s affiliation agreements with mvpds are multiyear contracts that provide for payments to the company that are based in part on the number of mvpd subscribers covered by the agreement if declines in the number of mvpd subscribers are not fully offset by affiliate rate increases the company’s affiliate fee revenues will be negatively affected because mvpd subscriber losses could also decrease the potential audience for the company’s networks which is a critical factor affecting both the pricing and volume of advertising future mvpd subscriber declines could also adversely impact the company’s advertising revenues

the company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets

the us economy is undergoing a period of weakness which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending habits political and sociopolitical uncertainties and potential changes in trade relationships between the us and other countries the company also faces risks associated with the impact of weak economic conditions on advertisers affiliates suppliers wholesale distributors retailers insurers and others with which it does business

 

increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time and we cannot guarantee that the company will be able to refinance outstanding indebtedness or obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to the company or at all in addition the company’s access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the company’s shortterm and longterm debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies if we are not successful in obtaining financing or incur significantly higher borrowing costs than contemplated it may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the company’s lenders insurers customers and counterparties including vendors retailers and other partners for instance the inability of the company’s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the company and lead to negative effects on the company including business disruptions decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses

the company’s businesses operate in a highly competitive industry

the company competes with other companies for highquality content to reach large audiences and to generate advertising revenue the company also competes for distribution on mvpds and other thirdparty digital platforms the company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular television programming and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms which are increasing the number of content choices available to audiences the consolidation of advertising agencies distributors and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and made competition for audiences advertising revenue and distribution more intense competition for audiences andor advertising comes from a variety of sources including broadcast television networks cable television systems and networks internetdelivered platforms such as svod and avod services and mobile gaming and social media platforms audio programming and print and other media other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the company’s stations or networks or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns increased competition in the acquisition of programming may also affect the scope of rights we are able to acquire and the cost of such rights and the future value of the rights we acquire or retain cannot be predicted with certainty entering into or renewing contracts for programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in increased costs to the company with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on mvpds for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from acquired rights contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations

our business is dependent on the popularity of special sports events and the continued popularity of the sports leagues and teams for which we have programming rights

our sports business depends on the popularity and success of the sports franchises leagues and teams for which we have acquired broadcast and cable network programming rights if a sports league declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm this may negatively impact viewership and advertising and affiliate fee revenues received in connection with our sports programming our operating results may be impacted in part by special events such as the nfl’s super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks the mlb’s world series and the fifa world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sports events delivered to consumers on our broadcast television and cable networks our advertising and affiliate fee revenues are subject to fluctuations based on the dates of sports events and their availability for viewing through our broadcast television and cable networks and the popularity of the competing teams for example any decrease in the number of postseason games played in a sports league for which we have acquired broadcast programming rights or the participation of a smallermarket sports franchise in postseason competition could result in lower advertising revenues for the company there can be no assurance that any sports league will continue to generate fan enthusiasm or provide the expected number of regular and postseason games for advertisers and customers alike and the failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally increased competition for the sale of sports event advertising time with other television networks stations and other advertising platforms such as digital media radio and print may adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results a 

 

shortfall in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the company has acquired rights or in the volume of sports programming the company expects to distribute could adversely affect the company’s advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate fee revenues 

the inability to renew programming rights particularly sports programming rights on sufficiently favorable terms or at all could cause the company’s advertising and affiliate fee revenues to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sports events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors programming rights agreements retransmission consent agreements carriage contracts and affiliation agreements have varying durations and renewal terms that are subject to negotiation with other parties the outcome of which is unpredictable in addition competition for popular programming rights and sports programming rights in particular that are licensed from third parties is intense and the licenses have varying duration and renewal terms moreover the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions andor league agreements that we may not be able to control including a decision to alter the number frequency and timing of regular and postseason games played during a season as these contracts expire we may seek renewals on favorable terms however third parties may outbid us for the rights contracts the loss of rights or renewal on less favorable terms could impact the quality or quantity of the company’s programs in particular the sports coverage offered by the company its cable networks broadcast stations and affiliates to the fox network and could adversely affect the company’s advertising and affiliate fee revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising and affiliate fee revenues in addition if the company does not obtain exclusive rights to the programming it distributes it could negatively impact the company’s advertising and affiliate fee revenues 

acceptance of the company’s content by the public is difficult to predict which could lead to fluctuations in revenues

television distribution is a speculative business since the revenues derived from the distribution of content depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public which is difficult to predict low public acceptance of the company’s content will adversely affect the company’s results of operations the commercial success of our programming also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programming the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in programming and the acquisition of sports rights before we learn the extent to which the content will earn consumer acceptance competition for popular content particularly for sports and entertainment programming is intense and the company may need to increase the price paid for popular content rights the company’s failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content or a decline in the ratings or popularity of the company’s news sports or entertainment television programming which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming could adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate fee revenues

damage to our brands particularly the fox brand or our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our brands particularly the fox brand are among our most valuable assets we believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business maintaining further enhancing and extending our brands may require us to make significant investments in marketing programming or new products services or events these investments may not be successful we may introduce new programming that is not popular with our consumers and advertisers which may negatively affect our brands to the extent our content in particular our live news and sports programming and primetime entertainment programming is not compelling to consumers our ability to maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted governmental scrutiny and fines and significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations content products management employees practices advertisers or other business partners may damage the company’s reputation and brands even if such claims are untrue furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted if we are not successful in maintaining or enhancing the image or awareness of our brands or if our reputation is harmed for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our investments in new businesses products services and technologies through acquisitions and other strategic investments present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we had contemplated which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have acquired and invested in and expect to continue acquiring and investing in new businesses products services and technologies that complement enhance or expand our current businesses or otherwise offer us growth opportunities such acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from an investment to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the investment a failure of the investment or acquired business to perform as expected meet financial projections or achieve strategic goals a failure to further develop an acquired business product service or technology unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to not realize anticipated benefits or to incur unanticipated liabilities difficulties in integrating the operations personnel technologies and systems of acquired businesses the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses the diversion of management attention from current operations and compliance with new regulatory regimes because acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and their anticipated benefits or value may not materialize our acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

the company is subject to complex laws regulations rules industry standards and contractual obligations related to privacy and personal data protection which are evolving inconsistent and potentially costly

we are subject to us federal and state laws as well as laws from other countries relating to the collection use disclosure and security of personal information for example the california consumer privacy act that became effective in january 2020 imposes new obligations on businesses’ collection use handling and disclosure of personal information of california residents and imposes fines for noncompliance the eu and other countries also have privacy and data security legislation with significant penalties for violations that may apply to the company’s operations new privacy and data protection laws continue to be introduced and interpretations of existing privacy laws some of which may be inconsistent with one another continue to evolve although the company expends significant resources to comply with privacy and data protection laws we may be subject to regulatory or other legal action despite these efforts any such action could result in damage to our reputation or brands loss of customers or revenue and other negative impacts to our operations the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any claims the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur for more information see item 1 “government regulation – privacy and information regulation”

the degradation failure or misuse of the company’s network and information systems and other technology could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data or other confidential information resulting in increased costs liabilities or loss of revenue

disruptions to our computer network and information systems such as computer hacking and phishing theft computer viruses ransomware worms or other destructive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing as well as power outages natural or other disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may affect our network and information systems including those of our vendors and could result in disruption of our services misappropriation misuse alteration theft loss leakage falsification and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure of confidential or other information including intellectual property and personal data contained on such network and systems while we continue to develop implement and maintain security measures seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of our network and information systems such efforts are costly require ongoing monitoring and updating and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and become more sophisticated and targeted the company’s high profile sports and entertainment programming and its extensive news coverage of elections sociopolitical events and public controversies subject us to heightened cybersecurity risks although no cybersecurity incident has been material to the company’s businesses to date we expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material incident any cybersecurity incidents could result in a disruption of our operations customer or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to our reputation or brands regulatory investigations claims lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue and the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any incidents the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur

 

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and signal theft and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights 

content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the company’s revenues from products and services including but not limited to television shows cable and other programming the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy as well as cable and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft however policing unauthorized use of the company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement developments in technology including digital copying file compression technology growing penetration of highbandwidth internet connections increased availability and speed of mobile data networks and new devices and applications that enable unauthorized access to content increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to access duplicate widely distribute and store highquality pirated material in addition developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of usergenerated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content including those emanating from other countries in various languages may adversely impact the company’s businesses the proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the company’s content could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services

the company takes a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of the company’s rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and how those laws are construed if those laws are interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase a change in the laws of one jurisdiction may also have an impact on the company’s overall ability to protect its intellectual property rights across other jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft further while piracy and the proliferation of piracyenabling technology tools continue to escalate if any laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed weakened or not adequately enforced or if the applicable legal systems fail to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase

the loss of key personnel including talent could disrupt the management or operations of the company’s business and adversely affect its revenues

the company’s business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of its executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch chairman k rupert murdoch and other key employees and news sports and entertainment personalities the company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company including the impairment of the company’s ability to execute its business strategy additionally the company employs or independently contracts with several news sports and entertainment personalities with significant loyal audiences news sports and entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of programming on a television station or cable network and therefore a significant influence on the ability of the station or network to sell advertising the company’s broadcast television stations and cable networks deliver programming with highly regarded onair talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for the distributed news sports and entertainment content there can be no assurance that these news sports and entertainment personalities will remain with us or will retain their current appeal or that the costs associated with retaining this and new talent will be favorable or acceptable to us if the company fails to retain or attract these news sports and entertainment personalities and talent or they lose their current audiences or advertising partners the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

labor disputes whether involving our own employees or those at businesses that we depend on may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

in a variety of the company’s businesses the company and its partners engage the services of trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a 

 

significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins moreover the company has certain collective bargaining agreements which are industrywide agreements and the company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements in dispute 

in addition our broadcast television and cable networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports leagues to broadcast and produce sports events including certain college football and basketball nfl and mlb games any labor disputes that occur in any sports league for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events resulting in decreased revenues which could adversely affect our business revenue and results of operations

changes in us communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

the company is subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate in general the television broadcasting and traditional mvpd industries in the us are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc the fcc generally regulates among other things the ownership of media broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees for example the company is required to apply for and operate in compliance with licenses from the fcc to operate a television station purchase a new television station or sell an existing television station with licenses generally subject to an eightyear renewable term our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including those relating to issues such as content regulation user privacy and data protection and consumer protection among others further the united states congress the fcc and state legislatures currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes and measures relating to network neutrality privacy and data security which could directly or indirectly affect the operations and ownership of the company’s media properties any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the company’s advertising revenues in addition some policymakers maintain that traditional mvpds should be required to offer a la carte programming to subscribers on a network by network basis or “family friendly” programming tiers unbundling packages of program services may increase both competition for carriage on distribution platforms and marketing expenses which could adversely affect the business financial condition and results of operations of the company’s cable networks the threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue similarly new federal or state laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of federal or state law or in regulations imposed by the us government could require changes in the operations or ownership of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the company may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities including under fcc rules and policies or delays in our renewal and other applications with the fcc

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm the fcc has indicated that in addition to issuing fines to licensees it would consider initiating license revocation proceedings for “serious” indecency violations we air a significant amount of live news reporting and live sports coverage on our broadcast television stations and networks and a portion of our content is under the control of our onair talent the company cannot predict whether information delivered by our stations and onair talent could violate fcc rules related to indecency which had been found to be unconstitutionally vague by the us supreme court especially given the spontaneity of live news and sports programming violation of the fcc’s indecency rules could subject us to government investigation penalties license revocation or renewal or qualification proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the ability of nonus citizens and certain other persons to invest in us

the company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of us television stations under the communications act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the communications act and the fcc rules without the fcc’s prior approval no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of its stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to take action to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a 

 

nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder we are currently in compliance with applicable us law and continue to monitor our foreign ownership based on our assessment of the information reasonably available to us but we are not able to predict whether we will need to take action pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the fcc could review the company’s compliance with applicable us law in connection with its consideration of the company’s renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the company owns 

the failure or destruction of satellites or transmitter facilities the company depends on to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect its businesses and results of operations as could changes in fcc regulations governing the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum

the company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption occurs failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses and results of operations each of the company’s television stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses and results of operations further changes in fcc regulations could reduce the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum the decreased availability of satellite transmission spectrum could increase interference to and diminish the quality of our transmissions if the fcc reallocates the portion of the satellite transmission spectrum the company uses to transmit its programming without safeguarding video delivery it would significantly hinder the company’s ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds 

the company could be subject to significant tax liabilities

we are subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations practices or the interpretations thereof could affect the company’s results of operations judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes in addition transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain

tax returns are routinely audited taxrelated litigation or settlements may occur and certain jurisdictions may assess income tax liabilities against us the final outcomes of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our historical tax provisions and accruals these outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings opinions of counsel or other interpretations provided to the company if these matters are adversely resolved we may be required to recognize additional charges to our tax provisions and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill intangible assets and programming

in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including fcc licenses the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and other longlived assets any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of our programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets programming rights investments or longlived assets could result in a noncash impairment charge any such charge could be material to the company’s reported net earnings

 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in news corp  and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of news corp 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of common stock of news corporation which we refer to as news corp and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of news corp including our chairman k rupert murdoch who serves as news corp’s executive chairman and our executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch who serves as news corp’s cochairman this ownership of or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for news corp and the company in addition to any other arrangements that the company and news corp may agree to implement the company and news corp have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies

our amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that our directors and officers as well as certain of our stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of news corp and the company each of which we refer to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of news corp and certain of its affiliates our amended and restated bylaws provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to us or to any of our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity to news corp instead of us the provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities to news corp instead of us 

certain provisions of the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws delaware law the company’s stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval

the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things















these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable

 

further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the outstanding fox class a common stock and 3 9  1  of fox class b common stock k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional less than one percent of fox class b common stock and approximately one percent of fox class a common stock thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately one percent of fox class a common stock and 3 9  7  of fox class b common stock 

this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of fox class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of fox class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement prevents unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

on november 6 2019 the company announced that its board of directors approved a 2 billion stock repurchase program for the fox class a common stock and fox class b common stock which could increase the percentage of fox class b common stock held by the murdoch family trust at the same time the company also announced that it had entered into a stockholders agreement by and between the company and the murdoch family trust pursuant to which the company and the murdoch family trust have agreed not to take actions that would result in the murdoch family trust and murdoch family members together owning more than 44 of the outstanding voting power of the shares of fox class b common stock or would increase the murdoch family trust’s voting power by more than 175 in any rolling 12month period the murdoch family trust would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the murdoch family trust and the murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44 of the outstanding voting power of the class b shares except where a murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the murdoch family trust on any matter

risks related to the company’s separation from 21cf

the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits it expects to achieve as a standalone publicly traded company

following the transaction the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than the company would have otherwise been while it was still part of 21cf as part of 21cf the company enjoyed certain benefits from 21cf’s scale operating diversity and access to capital which are no longer available as a standalone publicly traded company we expect to benefit from among other things sharpened focus on the financial and operational resources of the company’s businesses which allows management to design and implement a capital structure corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic opportunities of the fox businesses we believe this will allow us to respond more effectively to industry dynamics and to create effective incentives for management and employees that are more closely tied to fox’s business performance if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a standalone publicly traded company or such benefits are delayed our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

the company may be unable to make on a timely or costeffective basis the changes necessary to operate effectively as a standalone publicly traded company and the company may experience increased costs as a result of the transaction

the company historically operated as part of 21cf’s broader corporate organization and 21cf provided various corporate services for us including information technology tax administration treasury activities accounting benefits administration legal and ethics and compliance program administration following the transaction 21cf has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than the transition services under the transition services agreements entered into in connection with the transaction these transition services include broadcast operations sports production information systems and technology enterprise infrastructure operations and digital finance and accounting and other corporate services generally the services provided under the transition services agreements are provided at cost for a period not exceeding two years during this period we depend on 21cf for these services and are subject to the risk of 21cf not properly performing its obligations under an agreement if 21cf is not in compliance with its obligations and 

 

following the expiration of the term for a specific service under a transition services agreement the company will need to provide the services internally or obtain them from third parties the company may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those the company receives from 21cf the company is in the process of upgrading its systems including information technology and implementing additional financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures the company has incurred and expects to incur additional expenses related to these steps and these expenses may be significant the company may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently or may incur additional costs that could adversely affect the company’s business if the company is unable to upgrade its financial and management controls reporting systems information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion or if the company fails to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining the services being provided by 21cf the company’s ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules applicable to public companies could be impaired and the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

the company has a limited operating history as a standalone publicly traded company and the company’s historical financial information for periods prior to the date of the transaction is not necessarily representative of the results the company would have achieved as a standalone publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of the company’s future results

the company derived the historical financial information for periods prior to the date of the transaction the “pretransaction periods” included in this annual report from 21cf’s consolidated financial statements and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position the company would have achieved as a standalone publicly traded company during the pretransaction periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future this is primarily because of the following factors







therefore the company’s historical financial statements relating to the pretransaction periods may not be indicative of the company’s performance as a standalone publicly traded company

 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21cf in connection with the transaction may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21cf  the indemnification from 21cf may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities that have been allocated to 21cf 

pursuant to the agreements the company and 21cf entered into in connection with the transaction 21cf will indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company will indemnify 21cf for certain liabilities payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities of the businesses that were retained by 21cf in connection with the transaction 21cf has agreed to indemnify the company for such liabilities but such indemnity from 21cf may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities and 21cf may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from 21cf any amounts for which it is held liable the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21cf

each member of the 21cf consolidated group which prior to the transaction included 21cf the company and 21cf’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income and in certain jurisdictions state tax liabilities of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the transaction consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of what was previously the 21cf consolidated group the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the transaction requires 21cf andor disney to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that the company cannot quantify

introduction

the distribution

on march 19 2019 the company became a standalone publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by twentyfirst century fox inc now known as tfcf corporation “21cf” of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fox to 21cf stockholders other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21cf the “distribution” in accordance with the amended and restated distribution agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20 2018 by and between 21cf and 21cf distribution merger sub inc following the distribution 354 million and 266 million shares of the company’s class a common stock par value 001 per share the “class a common stock” and class b common stock par value 001 per share the “class b common stock” and together with the class a common stock the “common stock” respectively began trading independently on the nasdaq global select market in connection with the distribution the company entered into the separation and distribution agreement dated as of march 19 2019 the “separation agreement” with 21cf which effected the internal restructuring the “separation” whereby 21cf transferred to fox a portfolio of 21cf’s news sports and broadcast businesses including fox news media consisting of fox news and fox business fox entertainment fox sports fox television stations and sports cable networks fs1 fs2 fox deportes and big ten network and certain other assets and fox assumed from 21cf the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities the separation and the distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the amended and restated merger agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20 2018 the “21cf disney merger agreement” by and among 21cf the walt disney company “disney” and certain subsidiaries of disney pursuant to which among other things 21cf became a whollyowned subsidiary of disney 

pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement immediately prior to the distribution the company paid to 21cf a dividend in the amount of 85 billion the “dividend” the final determination of the taxes in respect of the separation and the distribution for which the company is responsible pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement and a prepayment of the estimated taxes in respect of divestitures collectively the “transaction tax” was 65 billion following the distribution on march 20 2019 the company received a cash payment in the amount of 20 billion from disney which had the net effect of reducing the dividend the company paid to 21cf the transaction tax included a prepayment of the company’s share of the estimated tax liabilities resulting from the anticipated divestitures by disney of certain assets principally the fox sports regional sports networks which were sold by disney during calendar year 2019 this prepayment was in the amount of approximately 700 million and is subject to adjustment in the future when the actual amounts of all such tax liabilities are reported on the federal income tax returns of disney or a subsidiary of disney see note 22 —subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements   

as a result of the separation and the distribution which was a taxable transaction for which the estimated tax liability of 58 billion was included in the transaction tax paid by the company fox obtained a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values this resulted in estimated annual tax deductions of approximately 15 billion principally over the next several years related to the amortization of the additional tax basis this amortization is estimated to reduce the company’s annual cash tax liability by 370 million per year at the current combined federal and state applicable tax rate of approximately 25 such estimates are subject to revisions which could be material based upon the occurrence of future events including among other things a refund of the prepayment discussed above 

in connection with the separation the company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the company’s relationship with 21cf and disney following the separation these include the separation agreement a tax matters agreement transition services agreements as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses employee matters commercial arrangements and a studio lot lease see note 1 — description of business and basis of presentation to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “the distribution” for additional information 

 

basis of presentation 

the company’s financial statements as of and for the years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 are presented on a consolidated basis the company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended june 30 2020 reflect the company’s results of operations and cash flows as a standalone company and the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2020 and 2019 consist of the company’s consolidated balances

prior to the distribution which occurred on march 19 2019 the company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21cf the company’s financial statements for the year ended june 30 2018 are presented on a combined basis as the company was not a separate consolidated group prior to the distribution these financial statements reflect the combined historical results of operations financial position and cash flows of 21cf’s domestic news national sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets and liabilities associated with such businesses  

the consolidated and combined statements of operations for the years ended june 30 2019 and 2018 include for the periods prior to march 19 2019 allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within 21cf prior to the distribution and not recorded at the business unit level such as certain expenses related to finance legal insurance information technology compliance and human resources management activities among others 21cf did not routinely allocate these costs to any of its business units these expenses were allocated to fox on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of combined revenues headcount or other relevant measures management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21cf are reasonable nevertheless the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by fox and may not reflect fox’s consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the entirety of the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if fox had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations this discussion is organized as follows 











 

overview of the company’s business 

the company is a news sports and entertainment company which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments 







cable network programming and television 

the cable network programming and television industries continue to evolve rapidly with changes in technology leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when where and how they consume content consumer preferences have evolved toward alternative offerings such as subscription videoondemand “svod” services avod services mobile and social media platforms these changes in technologies and consumer behavior have contributed to declines in the number of subscribers to traditional mvpd services and these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future

at the same time technological changes have affected advertisers’ options for reaching their target audiences there has been a substantial increase in the availability of programming with reduced advertising or without advertising at all as consumers switch to digital consumption of video content there is still to be developed a consistent broadly accepted measure of audiences across the industry furthermore the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending from more traditional media and toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising 

given these changes in technology and consumption habits the company believes its strength in “appointmentbased” content provides the company with a strategic advantage fox differentiates itself from its competitors by focusing on audiences at a meaningful scale watching premium content in realtime and by attracting sales from advertising customers who want to reach larger audiences within specified time parameters as the share of live news and sports consumption has increased across television viewing overall from approximately 23 of all live viewership in calendar 2015 to approximately 31 in calendar 2019 fox has strategically built one of the mostfollowed news and sports platforms in the country realtime consumption of live news and sports programming has increased approximately 6 from 2015 to 2019 fox’s franchises are leaders in these growing categories generating strong demand from both advertisers and traditional and digital mvpds as viewers increasingly move toward adfree or delayed viewing we believe the scale of our live audiences and premium nature of the content we deliver across our channels increasingly differentiate us from our competitors audiences engage with fox’s content in realtime and as a result our offerings have become more valuable to distributors and advertisers leading to higher revenues for fox in addition we have expanded the distribution of our premium content across digital mvpds all of our key networks are offered in all major digital mvpd services and we are cultivating direct interactions between fox brands and consumers outside of traditional linear television

the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is dependent to a large extent on the impact of changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies the sale of advertising on its cable and broadcast networks and television stations maintenance renewal and terms of its carriage affiliation and content agreements and programming rights the popularity of its content general economic conditions including financial market conditions the company’s ability to manage its businesses effectively and its relative strength and leverage in the industry for more information see item 1 “business” and item 1a “risk factors” included herein

 

the company’s cable network programming and television segments derive a majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales for fiscal 20 20  the company generated revenues of  123 billion of which approximately 48  was generated from affiliate fees approximately 43  was generated from advertising and approximately 9  was generated from other operating activities 

affiliate fees primarily include i monthly subscriberbased license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry our cable networks and our owned and operated television stations and ii fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the fox network us law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from traditional mvpds who carry the company’s broadcast signals

affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to mvpds typically to facilitate the carriage of a cable network the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straightline basis over the contract period traditional mvpds are currently the predominant means of distribution of the company’s program services while digital mvpds have become an increasingly significant share of overall distribution

revenues are impacted by rate changes changes in the number of subscribers to the company’s content and changes in the expenditures by advertisers which continue to be impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” as discussed below in addition advertising revenues are subject to seasonality and cyclicality as a result of the impact of state congressional and presidential elections cycles and special events that air on the company’s networks including the national football league’s “nfl” super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks major league baseball’s “mlb” world series  and the fédération internationale de football association “fifa” world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sports events including one nfl divisional playoff game that is aired on a rotating annual basis with another network

the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment and the television segment are acquisition and production expenses related to programming marketing and promotional expenses and expenses related to broadcasting the company’s programming marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming consistent with advertising revenues sports programming and production expenses are subject to seasonality and cyclicality due to the timing of sports events as discussed above additional expenses include salaries employee benefits rent and other routine overhead expenses

the company’s advertising revenues and operating expenses are generally higher and operating cash flows are generally lower in the second quarter of each fiscal year due to the concentration of sports events in the fall including the broadcast of mlb’s world series and nfl and college football games

the profitability of us national sports contracts is based on the company’s best estimates at june 30 2020 of attributable revenues and costs such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant should revenues decline materially from estimates applied at june 30 2020 amortization of rights may be accelerated should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues the company may have improved results related to the applicable contract which may be recognized over the remaining contract term

other corporate and eliminations

the other corporate and eliminations segment consists primarily of the fox studio lot credible corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations

other business developments

the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment and disruption to the company’s business weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets pose risks to the company and its business partners including advertisers whose expenditures tend to reflect overall economic conditions the covid19 pandemic has caused some of the company’s advertisers including in particular local market advertisers to reduce their spending and future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could negatively impact their advertising expenditures further depending on the duration and severity of the recession it could lead to changes in consumer behavior including increasing numbers of consumers canceling or foregoing subscriptions to mvpd services that adversely affect the company’s affiliate fee and advertising revenues in addition the company’s business depends on the volume and 

 

popularity of the content it distributes particularly sports content following the covid19 outbreak s ports events to which the company has broadcast rights have been cancelled or postponed and the production of certain entertainment content the company distributes has been suspended  although some of these sports events and productions have resumed or are expected to resume during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 there may be additional content disruptions in the future  depending on their duration and severity these disruptions could materially adversely affect the company’s future advertising revenues and over a longer period of time its future affiliate fee revenues to the extent the pandemic further negatively impacts the company’s ability to air sports events particularly mlb nfl or college sports it could result in a significantly greater adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations than the company has experienced thus far in addition shifting sports schedules may negatively impact the company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers to its sports and entertainment programming principally due to the impact of covid19 t he company’s television segment experienced a 29 decline in advertising revenue in the quarter ended june 30 2020 if current trends in television segment advertising demand continue for the entire first quarter of fiscal 2021 the company expects advertising revenue at the television segment to decrease approximately 230 million to 250 million or approximately 30 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2020  this is due to the ongoing impact of covid19 including continued weakness in the local advertising market in which the fox television stations operate fewer hours of original entertainment programming and fewer college football games as well as certain comparative items including the timing of nfl games and the absence of the prior year broadcast of the fifa women’s world cup  partially offset by higher cyclical political advertising and the impact of the consolidation of tubi if there is a significant decline in the company’s estimated revenues or the expected popularity of its programming  it could lead to a downward revision in the value of among other things the company’s reporting units indefinitelived intangible assets  programming rights and longlived assets and result in a noncash impairment charge that is material to the company’s reported net earnings  

in april 2020 the company acquired tubi an avod service for approximately 445 million in cash the “tubi acquisition” net of cash acquired potential additional consideration in the form of deferred consideration and unvested options totaling approximately 45 million may be due over a threeyear period following the closing of the transaction and will be recognized as compensation expense over that period the company financed the tubi acquisition principally with the net proceeds from the sale of its investment in roku inc “roku” which was sold for approximately 340 million in march 2020  see note 3—acquisitions disposals and other transactions to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “roku” for further discussion

segment analysis 

the company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company’s internal management structure which is organized based on operating activities the company evaluates performance based upon several factors of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization or segment ebitda due to the integrated nature of these operating segments estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets revenues and expenses

segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses segment ebitda does not include amortization of cable distribution investments depreciation and amortization impairment and restructuring charges interest expense interest income other net and income tax expense benefit management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the company’s businesses

nongaap financial measures

beginning with the announcement of the company’s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the company has renamed as “adjusted ebitda” the measure that it had previously referred to as “total segment ebitda” and prior to the announcement of the company’s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as “total segment oibda” the definition of this measure has not changed adjusted ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses adjusted ebitda does not include amortization of cable distribution investments depreciation and amortization impairment and restructuring charges interest expense interest income other net and income tax expense benefit

management believes that information about adjusted ebitda assists all users of the company’s financial statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company’s portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results adjusted ebitda provides management investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and 

 

competitors’ data although historical results including adjusted ebitda may not be indicative of future results as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences and the impact of covid19 and other widespread health emergencies or pandemics and measures to contain their spread  

adjusted ebitda is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges which are significant components in assessing the company’s financial performance adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

use of estimates

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “use of estimates”

revenue recognition

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment

cable network programming and television

the company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the company’s network programming to be aired by television networks and cable channels and from sales of broadcast advertising time on the company’s owned and operated television stations and various digital properties advertising revenue from customers primarily advertising agencies is recognized as the commercials are aired certain of the company’s advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views referred to as impressions revenues for any audience deficiencies are deferred until the guaranteed number of impressions is met by providing additional advertisements advertising contracts which are generally shortterm are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month with payments due shortly after the invoice date

the company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with traditional and digital mvpds for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the company’s owned and operated television stations in addition the company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and receive retransmission consent fees from traditional and digital mvpds for their signals affiliate fee revenue is recognized at a point in time when the network programming a functional license of intellectual property is made available to the customer which is done on a continuous basis for contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliate’s subscribers revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period for contracts with fixed affiliate fees revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the contract term which generally reflects the invoiced amount affiliate contracts are generally multiyear contracts with payments due monthly

the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to mvpds to facilitate carriage of a cable network against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 606103225 through 27 “revenue recognition—consideration payable to a customer” the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straightline basis over the contract period

programming 

costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing television broadcast network entertainment programming which includes acquired series coproduced series movies and other programs are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its total revenue estimates on a contract basis which may result in a change in the rate of amortization andor a writedown of the asset to fair value

 

as a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with the company’s programming rights the company recognized writedown s of approximately 95 million and  55 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively related to sports entertainment and syndicated programming rights at the cable network programming and television segment s  which were recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement s of operations 

the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sports events the costs of multiyear national sports contracts at the fox network and the company’s sports channels are primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period’s attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract estimates can change and accordingly are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary such changes in the future could be material the recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on the fox network and the company’s sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company’s intangible assets include goodwill fcc licenses mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income

the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles including goodwill amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method

carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” the company’s impairment review is based on among other methods a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the company to perform an interim impairment test

the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires among other inputs the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations this method also involves the use of management’s judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the us broadcast industry the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these longterm assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material

during fiscal 2020 the company determined that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2020 were not impaired the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment

see note 8—goodwill and intangible assets net to the accompanying financial statements under the heading “annual impairment review” for further discussion

 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income tax in various domestic jurisdictions the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in making this assessment management analyzes future taxable income reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income

for information regarding the impact of the tax act see note 16—income taxes to the accompanying financial statements

employee costs

the measurement and recognition of costs of the company’s pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions

the company participates in andor sponsors various pension savings and postretirement benefit plans pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements prior to the separation and the distribution certain of the company’s employees participated in defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by 21cf “shared plans” which include participants of other 21cf subsidiaries shared plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans therefore no asset or liability was recorded to recognize the funded status in contemplation of the separation and the distribution the pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities of the shared plans allocable to the company’s employees were transferred to the company in fiscal 2019 see note 15 — pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying financial statements

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality the company considers current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the company considered the pension portfolio’s future return expectations of the various asset classes the expected longterm rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 50 equity securities 25 fixed income securities and 25 in other investments

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixed income investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2020 and 2019 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following

 



 

 

discount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date the company will utilize discount rates of 29 and 22 in calculating the fiscal 2021 service cost and interest cost respectively for its plans the company will use a longterm rate of return of 65 for fiscal 2021 based principally on the future return expectation of the plans’ asset mix the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2020 were 533 million which increased from 385 million as of june 30 2019 this increase of 148 million was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption utilized in measuring plan obligations lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear pension expense these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation “pbo” are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants

the company made contributions of 30 million 83 million and 30 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 



 

fiscal 2021 net periodic pension expense for the company’s pension plans is expected to increase to approximately 65 million primarily due to a decrease in discount rates

broadcast licenses the communications act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest convenience and necessity the company owns broadcast licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations under the communications act television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years generally the fcc renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest convenience and necessity there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which taken together indicate a pattern of abuse currently fox television stations has no pending renewal applications for its television broadcast licenses 

ownership regulations under the fcc’s national television ownership rule as established by congress one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39 of all us television households subject to the uhf discount under the uhf discount a uhf television station is attributed with reaching only 50 of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach under the national ownership rule in december 2017 the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying retaining or eliminating the 39 national television audience reach limitation including possibly the uhf discount if the fcc determines in the future to eliminate the uhf discount but does not eliminate or modify the national television audience reach limitation the company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be affected 

under the fcc’s local television ownership rule one party may own up to two television stations in the same dma and there is also a presumptive prohibition on the ownership of two stations ranked among the topfour stations in a dma based on audience share measured as of the date an application for fcc approval of an acquisition is filed in november 2017 the fcc issued a reconsideration order that relaxed the local television ownership rule so that among other things station owners could petition the fcc to permit ownership of two stations both ranked among the top four in a market

also in the 2017 fcc reconsideration order the fcc eliminated the newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule which prohibited common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers in the same market the reconsideration order is currently the subject of an appeal in the united states court of appeals for the third circuit prior to the elimination of the rule the company had operated under waivers of the crossownership rule because company shareholders retained an attributable interest in the new york post a daily newspaper in the new york dma by virtue of the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both news corporation “news corp” and the company if the elimination of the newspaperbroadcast crossownership rule is overturned by the court the company’s operations or future conduct including the acquisition of any broadcast networks or stations or any newspapers in the same local markets in which news corp owns or operates newspapers or has acquired television stations may affect news corp’s ability to own and operate its business in compliance with the rule we have agreed with news corp that if we acquire newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede news corp’s business then we will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit news corp to hold its media interests and to comply with applicable rules 

 

under the communications act no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 o f the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country this ownership limit can be waived if the fcc finds it to be in the public interest the fcc could review the company’s compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of fox television stations’ license renewal applications 

carriage and content regulations fcc regulations require each television broadcaster to elect at threeyear intervals either to require carriage of its signal by traditional mvpds in the station’s market or to negotiate the terms in which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional mvpds within its market which we refer to as the retransmission consent generally fox television stations has elected retransmission consent for all of its owned and operated stations 

federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger in addition under fcc regulations television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming which among other requirements must serve as a “significant purpose” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under a television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions including monetary fines and the possible nonrenewal of its license 

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 600 am and 1000 pm federal law currently authorizes the fcc to impose fines of up to 407270 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts the fcc may impose fines for and also has the power to pursue license revocation proceedings in cases of serious or multiple violations of the indecency prohibition several complaints alleging the broadcast of indecent or profane material by fox television stations are believed to be pending at the fcc and it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such complaints 

modifications to the company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of fox television stations and the fox network if indecency regulation is extended to internet or cable and satellite programming and such extension was found to be constitutional some of the company’s other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels 

the fcc continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification political advertising children’s television environmental concerns equal employment opportunity technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance in addition the federal trade commission or ftc has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices particularly with respect to social media marketing both fcc and ftc rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser 

fcc rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming in addition federal law requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 25 largest markets to carry a specified minimum amount of hours of primetime or children’s programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions ie a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel the same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via internet protocol apps or services 

fcc regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations including among other things a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance 

violation of fcc regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures periodic reporting conditions shortterm license renewals and in egregious cases denial of license renewal or revocation of license violation of ftcimposed obligations can result in enforcement actions litigation consent decrees and ultimately substantial monetary fines 

national broadband plan in order to free up more spectrum for wireless broadband services the fcc has promulgated a national broadband plan that is intended to incentivize current privatesector spectrum holders to return some of their spectrum to the government through such initiatives as voluntary “incentive” spectrum auctions and “repacking” of channel assignments to increase efficient spectrum usage over time if voluntary measures fail to yield the 

 

amount of spectrum the fcc deems necessary for wireless broadband deploymen t the broadband plan proposed various mandates to reclaim spectrum such as forced channel sharing the fcc already has conducted one voluntary “incentive” auction to reclaim spectrum from broadcasters willing to relinquish it fox television stations had three stations’ bids to relinquish spectrum accepted by the fcc as part of that auction which concluded in march 2017 of its remaining stations nine will be required to repack during a multiyear transition 

cband reallocation in order to free up additional spectrum that will likely be used to provide the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services commonly referred to as 5g services  the fcc has initiated a notice of proposed rulemaking to determine whether a portion of the 500 mhz in the 37 to 42 ghz “cband” spectrum can be auctioned the cband forms the backbone of the infrastructure for how the company delivers its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds currently there is no viable scalable and reliable alternative for video delivery if the fcc does not adopt rules that safeguard video delivery while it reallocates and “repacks” the cband it would significantly hinder the company’s ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds 

broadcast transmission standard in november 2017 the fcc adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “next generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the advanced television systems committee inc also referred to as “atsc 30” fox television stations is actively planning to build out atsc 30 facilities fox television stations is participating in various atsc 30 testing with other broadcasters but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the company’s operations 

privacy and information regulation

the laws and regulations governing the collection use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving particularly as they relate to the company’s digital businesses 

federal laws and regulation affecting the company’s online services websites and other business activities include the children’s online privacy protection act which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or “spam” the video privacy protection act which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider” and the telephone consumer protection act which restricts certain marketing communications such as text and calls without explicit consent although the media industry is also active in selfregulatory initiatives relating to advertising and online privacy such initiatives may be replaced or superseded by government action a number of privacy and data security bills that address the collection maintenance and use of personal information breach notification requirements and cybersecurity are pending or have been adopted at both the state and federal level including the california consumer privacy act effective in 2020 in addition state attorneys general have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus 

nonus governments also have implemented and continue to introduce and assess new privacy and data security laws and regulations some of which could apply to us even if our business is conducted from the us it is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations the eu general data protection regulation in particular regulates the collection use and security of personal data and restricts the transborder flow of such data

the company monitors and considers these privacy and data security laws and regulations particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs these laws and regulations and their interpretation are subject to change and could result in increased compliance costs claims financial penalties for noncompliance changes to business practices or otherwise impact the company’s business for example violations of applicable privacy and data security laws could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties require us to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address and harm our reputation even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation

intellectual property

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in television programming and other publications websites and technologies trademarks trade dress service marks logos slogans sound marks design rights symbols characters names titles and trade names domain names patents or patent applications for inventions related to its 

 

products business methods andor services trade secrets and know how and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds th e company derives value from these assets through the production distribution andor licensing of its television programming to domestic and international cable and satellite television services videoondemand services operation of websites and throug h the sale of products such as collectible merchandise apparel books and publications among others 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property relying upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including offering legitimate market alternatives deploying digital rights management technologies pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights even if not valid such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations

prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the company’s securities 

risks related to the company’s business

the company must respond to changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies in order to remain competitive

technology particularly digital technology used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where and how they consume content content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internetdelivered content on televisions and portable devices the growth of direct to consumer video offerings including videoondemand downloadable content and simultaneous live streaming of broadcast content including on social media offerings by traditional mvpds of smaller packages of programming to customers at price points lower than traditional offerings and the trend of consumers “cordcutting” or cancelling their traditional mvpd subscriptions could adversely affect demand for our cable channels enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce television viewership which could negatively affect the company’s revenues in addition increased video consumption through streaming apps online video distributors and social media with no advertising or less advertising than on video programming networks time shifted viewing of television programming and the use of dvrs to skip advertisements could also negatively affect the company’s advertising revenues there is a risk that the company’s responses to these changes and strategies to remain competitive or failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new market changes could adversely affect our business the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s businesses asset values and results of operations 

the company’s businesses operate in a highly competitive industry

the company competes with other companies for highquality content to reach large audiences and to generate advertising revenue the company also competes for distribution on various traditional and digital mvpds and other thirdparty digital platforms the company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular television programming and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms which are increasing the number of content choices available to audiences the consolidation of advertising agencies distributors and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and made competition for audiences advertising revenue and distribution more intense competition for audiences andor advertising comes from broadcast television networks cable television systems and networks internetdelivered free advertising supported subscription and rental services other sources of information and entertainment radio print and other media other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the company’s stations or networks or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns increased competition in the acquisition of programming may also affect the scope of rights we are able to acquire and the cost of such rights and the value of the rights we acquire or retain cannot be predicted with certainty in the future entering into or renewing contracts for programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in increased costs to the company with respect to longterm contracts for sports programming rights our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharges or obtain carriage on traditional and digital mvpds for the content and the timing and amount of our rights payments there can be no assurance that revenue from acquired rights contracts will exceed our costs for the rights as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming the company cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations

a decline in advertising expenditures could cause the company’s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its cable and broadcast networks and television stations expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns our advertising revenues may vary substantially from year to year driven by major 

 

sporting events such as the nfl’s super bowl and the fifa world cup and by the state congressional and presidential elections cycles political advertising expendi tures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising and the competitive nature of the elections impacting viewers within markets featuring our progra mming a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audienc es demand for the company’s programming as measured by ratings points is a key factor in determining advertising rates and the affiliate rates received by the company in addition newer technologies including new video formats streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet videoondemand portable digital video devices and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences some of these devices and technologies allow users to vi ew programming from a remote location or on a timedelayed basis and provide users the ability to fastforward rewind pause and skip programming and advertisements these technological developments could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerin gs to advertisers in addition the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly from more traditional media or toward newer ways of purc hasing advertising such as through automated purchasing dynamic advertising insertion third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the company as traditional advertising method s a decrease in advertising expenditures reduced demand for the company’s programming or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the company’s content on all platforms could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses financial condition or results of operations 

the loss of affiliation and carriage agreements could cause the company’s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

the company maintains affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable it to reach a large percentage of households through traditional mvpds and third partyowned television stations a significant decline in the number of traditional mvpd arrangements or the loss of carriage on their basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the company’s owned and operated television stations and broadcast and cable networks which could adversely affect the company’s revenues from affiliate fees and its ability to sell national and local advertising time the loss of traditional favorable mvpd packaging positioning pricing or other marketing opportunities could also negatively impact the company’s revenues from affiliate fees consolidation among traditional mvpds their increased vertical integration into the cable or broadcast network business and alternative technologies to offer their subscribers access to local broadcast network programming have provided traditional mvpds with more leverage which could adversely affect the company’s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its owned and operated television stations and network programming on favorable or commercially reasonable terms or at all in addition if the company and a traditional mvpd reach an impasse in contract renewal negotiations the company’s networks and owned and operated television stations could become unavailable to the traditional mvpd’s subscribers ie “go dark” which depending on the length of time and the size of the traditional mvpd could have a negative impact on the company’s revenues from affiliate fees and advertising the company also depends on the maintenance of affiliation agreements with third partyowned television stations to distribute the fox network and mynetworktv consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to the company a significant decline in the number of affiliation arrangements with thirdparty owned television stations could reduce the distribution of the fox network and mynetworktv and adversely affect the company’s ability to sell national advertising time in addition the company has arrangements through which it makes its content available for viewing through online video platforms if these arrangements are not renewed on favorable or commercially reasonable terms or at all it could adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results 

our business is dependent on the popularity of special sports events and the continued popularity of the sports leagues and teams whose media rights we have programming rights to

our sports business depends on the popularity and success of the sports franchises leagues and teams for which we have acquired broadcast and cable network programming rights if a sports league declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm this may negatively impact viewership and advertising and affiliate revenues received in connection with our sports programming our operating results may be impacted in part by special events such as the nfl’s super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks the mlb’s world series and the fifa world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sporting events delivered to consumers on our broadcast television and cable networks our advertising and affiliate revenues are subject to fluctuations based on the dates of sporting events and their availability for viewing through our broadcast television and cable networks and the popularity of the competing teams for example any decrease in the 

 

number of postseason games played in a sports league for which we have acquired broadcast programming rights or the participation of a smallermarket sports franchise in postseason competition could result in less advertising re venues for the company there can be no assurance that any sports league will continue to generate fan enthusiasm or provide the expected number of regular and postseason games for advertisers and customers alike and the failure to do so could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally increased competition for the sale of sports event advertising time with other television networks stations and other advertising platforms such as di gital media radio and print may adversely affect the company’s revenues and operating results a shortfall in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the company has acquired rights or in the volume of sports programming the company expec ts to distribute could adversely affect the company’s advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate revenues 

the inability to renew programming rights particularly sports programming rights on sufficiently favorable terms could cause the company’s affiliate and advertising revenue to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors programming rights retransmission consent agreements carriage contracts and affiliation agreements have varying durations and renewal terms that are subject to negotiation with other parties the outcome of which is unpredictable in addition competition for popular programming rights and sports programming rights in particular that are licensed from third parties is intense and have varying duration and renewal terms moreover the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions andor league agreements that we may not be able to control including a decision to alter the number frequency and timing of regular and postseason games played during a season as these contracts expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts the loss of rights or renewal on less favorable terms could impact the extent of the company’s programs in particular the sports coverage offered by the company its cable networks broadcast stations and affiliates to the fox network and could adversely affect the company’s advertising and affiliate revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising and affiliate revenues in addition if the company does not obtain exclusive rights to the programming it distributes it could negatively impact the company’s advertising and affiliate revenues 

acceptance of the company’s content by the public is difficult to predict which could lead to fluctuations in revenues

television distribution is a speculative business since the revenues derived from the distribution of content depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public which is difficult to predict low public acceptance of the company’s content will adversely affect the company’s results of operations the commercial success of our programming also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programming the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in programming and the acquisition of sports rights before we learn the extent to which the content will earn consumer acceptance competition for popular content particularly for sports and entertainment programming is intense and the company may need to increase the price paid for popular content rights the company’s failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content or a decline in the ratings or popularity of the company’s news sports or entertainment television programming which could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming could adversely affect advertising revenues in the near term and over a longer period of time adversely affect affiliate revenues

the company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets

the company’s businesses financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak economic conditions factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending habits political uncertainties and potential changes in trade relationships between the us and other countries the company also faces risks associated with the impact of weak economic conditions on advertisers affiliates suppliers wholesale distributors retailers insurers and others with which it does business

 

increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it mor e difficult and more expensive for the company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing the financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time and we cann ot guarantee that the company will be able to refinance outstanding indebtedness or obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to the company or at all in addition the company’s access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the company’s shortte rm and longterm debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies if we are not successful in obtaining financing or incur significantly higher borrowing costs than contemplated it may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or resul ts of operations 

disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the company’s lenders insurers customers and counterparties including vendors retailers and other partners for instance the inability of the company’s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the company and lead to negative effects on the company including business disruptions decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses

damage to our brands particularly the fox brand or our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our brands particularly the fox brand are among our most valuable assets we believe that our brand image brand awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business maintaining further enhancing and extending our brands may require us to make significant investments in marketing programming or new products services or events these investments may not be successful we may introduce new programming that is not popular with our consumers and advertisers which may negatively affect our brands to the extent our content in particular our live news and sports programming and primetime entertainment programming is not compelling to consumers our ability to maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted unfavorable publicity regarding our content the actions of advertisers featured on our broadcast television and cable networks and governmental scrutiny or fines could adversely affect the company’s reputation and brands furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted if we are not successful in maintaining or enhancing the image or awareness of our brands or if our reputation is harmed for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our investments in new businesses products services and technologies through acquisitions and other strategic investments present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we had contemplated which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have acquired and invested in and expect to continue acquiring and investing in new businesses products services and technologies that complement enhance or expand our current businesses or otherwise offer us growth opportunities such acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from an investment to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the investment a failure of the investment or acquired business to perform as expected meet financial projections or achieve strategic goals a failure to further develop an acquired business product service or technology unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to not realize anticipated benefits or to incur unanticipated liabilities difficulties in integrating the operations personnel technologies and systems of acquired businesses the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired businesses and the diversion of management attention from current operations because acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and their anticipated benefits or value may not materialize our acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

the degradation failure or misuse of the company’s network and information systems and other technology could cause a disruption of services or improper disclosure of personal data or other confidential information resulting in increased costs liabilities or loss of revenue

network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hacking and phishing theft computer viruses ransomware worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing as well as power outages natural or other disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may affect our network and information systems including those of our vendors that the company uses and could result in disruption of our services misappropriation misuse alteration theft loss leakage falsification and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure of confidential or other information including intellectual property and personal data contained on such network 

 

and systems while we continue to develop implement and maintain security measures seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of our network and information systems such efforts are costly require ongoing monitoring and updating and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and become more sophisticated although no cybersecurity incident has been material to the company’s businesses to date we expect to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material incident any cybersecurity incidents could result in a disrup tion of our operations customer or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to our reputation or brands regulatory investigations claims lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue and the company may also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obl igations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and may be required to expend significant resources to defend remedy andor address any incidents the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occ ur 

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and signal theft and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights

content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the company’s revenues from products and services including but not limited to television shows cable and other programming the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy as well as cable and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft however policing unauthorized use of the company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement developments in technology including digital copying file compression technology growing penetration of highbandwidth internet connections increased availability and speed of mobile data networks and new devices and applications that enable unauthorized access to content increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to access duplicate widely distribute and store highquality pirated material in addition developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of usergenerated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content including those emanating from other countries in various languages may adversely impact the company’s businesses the proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the company’s content could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services

the company takes a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of the company’s rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and how those laws are construed if those laws are interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase a change in the laws of one jurisdiction may also have an impact on the company’s overall ability to protect its intellectual property rights across other jurisdictions there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft further while piracy and the proliferation of piracyenabling technology tools continue to escalate if any laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed weakened or not adequately enforced or if the applicable legal systems fail to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase

the loss of key personnel including talent could disrupt the management or operations of the company’s business and adversely affect its revenues

the company’s business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of its executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch chairman k rupert murdoch and other key employees and news sports and entertainment personalities the company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company including the impairment of the company’s ability to execute its business strategy additionally the company employs or independently contracts with several news sports and entertainment personalities with significant loyal audiences news sports and entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of programming on a television station or cable network and therefore a significant influence on the ability of the station or network to sell advertising the company’s broadcast television stations and cable networks deliver programming with highly regarded onair talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for the distributed news sports and entertainment content there can be no assurance that these news sports and entertainment 

 

personalities will remain with us or will retain their current appeal or that the costs associated with retaining this and new talent will be favorable or acceptable to us if the company fails to retain or attract th ese news sports and entertainment personalities and talent or they lose their current audiences or advertising partners the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

labor disputes whether involving our own employees or those at businesses that we depend on may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

in a variety of the company’s businesses the company and its partners engage the services of trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins moreover the company has certain collective bargaining agreements which are industrywide agreements and the company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements in dispute

in addition our broadcast television and cable networks have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports leagues to broadcast and produce sporting events including certain college football and basketball nfl and mlb games any labor disputes that occur in any sports league for which we have the rights to broadcast live games or events may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games or events resulting in decreased revenues which could adversely affect our business revenue and results of operations

changes in us communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations

the company is subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate in general the television broadcasting and traditional mvpd industries in the us are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc the fcc generally regulates among other things the ownership of media broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees for example the company is required to apply for and operate in compliance with licenses from the fcc to operate a television station purchase a new television station or sell an existing television station with licenses generally subject to an eightyear renewable term our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including those relating to issues such as content regulation user privacy and data protection and consumer protection among others further the united states congress the fcc and state legislatures currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters including technological changes and measures relating to network neutrality privacy and data security which could directly or indirectly affect the operations and ownership of the company’s media properties any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the company’s advertising revenues in addition some policymakers maintain that traditional mvpds should be required to offer a la carte programming to subscribers on a network by network basis or “family friendly” programming tiers unbundling packages of program services may increase both competition for carriage on distribution platforms and marketing expenses which could adversely affect the business financial condition and results of operations of the company’s cable networks the threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue similarly new federal or state laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of federal or state law or in regulations imposed by the us government could require changes in the operations or ownership of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the company may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities including under fcc rules and policies or delays in our renewal and other applications with the fcc

fcc rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm the fcc has indicated that in addition to issuing fines to licensees it would consider initiating license revocation proceedings for “serious” indecency violations we air a significant amount of live news reporting and live sports coverage on our broadcast television stations and networks and a portion of our content is under the control of our onair talent the company cannot predict whether information delivered by our stations and onair talent could violate fcc rules related to indecency which had been found to be unconstitutionally vague by the us supreme court especially given the spontaneity of live news and sports programming violation of the fcc’s indecency rules could subject us to government investigation penalties license 

 

revocation or renewal or qualification proceedings wh ich could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the communications act and fcc regulations limit the ability of nonus citizens and certain other persons to invest in us

the company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of us television stations under the communications act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the communications act and the fcc rules without the fcc’s prior approval no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25 of its stock is owned or voted by nonus persons their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to prevent cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold by taking any action including refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a nonus stockholder voiding a transfer of common stock to a nonus stockholder suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a nonus stockholder or redeeming common stock held by a nonus stockholder we are currently in compliance with applicable us law and continue to monitor our foreign ownership based on our assessment of the information reasonably available to us but we are not able to predict whether we will need to take action pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the fcc could review the company’s compliance with applicable us law in connection with its consideration of the company’s renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the company owns

the failure or destruction of satellites or transmitter facilities that the company depends upon to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect its businesses and results of operations as could changes in fcc regulations governing the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum

the company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption occurs failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses and results of operations each of the company’s television stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s businesses and results of operations further changes in fcc regulations could reduce the availability and use of satellite transmission spectrum the decreased availability of satellite transmission spectrum could increase interference to and diminish the quality of our transmissions if the fcc reallocates the portion of the satellite transmission spectrum the company uses to transmit its programming without safeguarding video delivery it would significantly hinder the company’s ability to deliver its programming to broadcast affiliates and traditional mvpds 

the company could be subject to significant tax liabilities

we are subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations practices or the interpretations thereof could affect the company’s results of operations judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes in addition transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain

tax returns are routinely audited taxrelated litigation or settlements may occur and certain jurisdictions may assess income tax liabilities against us the final outcomes of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our historical tax provisions and accruals these outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings opinions of counsel or other interpretations provided to the company if these matters are adversely resolved we may be required to recognize additional charges to our tax provisions and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

 

th e company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill intangible assets and programming 

in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including fcc licenses the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and other longlived assets any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of our programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units a downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or longlived assets could result in an impairment and a noncash charge any such charge could be material to the company’s reported net earnings

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in news corp and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of news corp

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of common stock of news corporation which we refer to as news corp and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of news corp including our chairman k rupert murdoch who serves as news corp’s executive chairman and our executive chairman and chief executive officer lachlan k murdoch who serves as news corp’s cochairman this ownership of or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for news corp and us in addition to any other arrangements that the company and news corp may agree to implement the company and news corp have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies

our amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that our directors and officers as well as certain of our stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of news corp and us each of which we refer to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of news corp and certain of its affiliates our amended and restated bylaws provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to us or to any of our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity to news corp instead of us the provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities to news corp instead of us 

certain provisions of the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws delaware law the company’s stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval

the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things









 







these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of fox even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable

in addition in connection with the transaction the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement pursuant to which each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock as applicable in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the then outstanding class b common stock or 15 of the combined class a common stock and class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to certain exceptions including for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock as of the date of adoption of the rights agreement the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on november 15 2019

further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the outstanding fox class a common stock and 384 of fox class b common stock k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional less than one percent of fox class b common stock and approximately one percent of fox class a common stock thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately one percent of fox class a common stock and 389 of fox class b common stock this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of fox additionally the ownership concentration of fox class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of fox class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement prevents unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval 

risks related to the company’s separation from 21cf

the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the expected benefits that it expects to achieve as a standalone publicly traded company

following the transaction the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than the company would have otherwise been while it was still part of 21cf as part of 21cf the company enjoyed certain benefits from 21cf’s scale operating diversity and access to capital which are no longer available as a standalone publicly traded company we expect to benefit from among other things sharpened focus on the financial and operational resources of the company’s businesses which allows management to design and implement a capital structure corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic opportunities of the fox businesses we believe this will allow us to respond more effectively to industry dynamics and to create effective incentives for management and employees that are more closely tied to fox’s business performance if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a standalone publicly traded company or such benefits are delayed our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

 

the company’s accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequatel y prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which the company is subject following the transaction  if the company is unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls the company’s results of operations cash flows and f inancial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s financial results were previously included within the consolidated results of 21cf and the company believes that its reporting and control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company however the company was not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the exchange act as a result of the transaction the company is directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act beginning with the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending june 30 2020 the company will be required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 as amended which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting and a report by the company’s independent registered public accounting firm these reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on the company’s management and administrative and operational resources including accounting resources

to comply with these requirements the company is relying in part on 21cf to provide it with services on a transitional basis under the transition services agreement that are similar to some of the financial administrative and other resources it provided the company prior to the transaction in addition the company is in the process of upgrading its systems including information technology and implementing additional financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures the company has incurred and expects to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps and these expenses may be significant if the company is unable to upgrade its financial and management controls reporting systems information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion the company’s ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the exchange act could be impaired any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the company may be unable to make on a timely or costeffective basis the changes necessary to operate effectively as a standalone publicly traded company and the company may experience increased costs as a result of the transaction

the company historically operated as part of 21cf’s broader corporate organization and 21cf provided various corporate services for us including information technology tax administration treasury activities accounting benefits administration legal and ethics and compliance program administration following the transaction 21cf has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than the transition services under the transition services agreement these transition services include among others broadcast operations sports production information systems and technology enterprise infrastructure operations and digital human resources services payroll and human resources information systembenefits administration finance and accounting facilities intellectual propertymusic and other corporate services generally the services provided under such transition services agreement are provided at cost for a period not exceeding two years during this period we depend on 21cf for these services and are subject to the risk of 21cf not properly performing its obligations under the transition services agreement if 21cf is not in compliance with its obligations and following the expiration of the term for a specific transition service under the transition services agreement the company will need to provide the covered services internally or obtain them from unaffiliated third parties the company may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those the company receives from 21cf because the company’s business historically operated as part of the wider 21cf organization the company may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently or may incur additional costs that could adversely affect the company’s business if the company fails to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services the company’s business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

the company has very limited operating history as a standalone publicly traded company and the company’s historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results the company would have achieved as a standalone publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of the company’s future results

the company derived the historical financial information included in this annual report from 21cf’s consolidated financial statements and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position it would have achieved as a standalone publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future this is primarily because of the following factors



 







in addition the company may incur increased costs as a result of the loss of synergies the company previously enjoyed by operating as part of 21cf following the transaction the company has been responsible for the additional costs associated with being a standalone publicly traded company including costs related to corporate governance investor and public relations and public reporting the company may also face reduced purchasing power with respect to certain enterprisewide purchases such as certain third party services certain offtheshelf software licenses and other information technology hardware and software relatedly the company’s historical financial data does not include an allocation of interest expense comparable to the interest expense the company has incurred as a result of the transaction and also does not reflect expected additional recurring costs related to fox operating as a standalone publicly traded company which could range between 225 million and 250 million on an annual basis see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—introduction

therefore the company’s historical financial statements may not be indicative of the company’s performance as a standalone publicly traded company

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21cf in connection with the transaction may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21cf the indemnification from 21cf may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities that have been allocated to 21cf

pursuant to the agreements the company and 21cf entered into connection with the transaction 21cf will indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company will indemnify 21cf for certain liabilities payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities of the businesses that were retained by 21cf in connection with the transaction 21cf has agreed to indemnify the company for such liabilities but such indemnity from 21cf may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities and 21cf may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from 21cf any amounts for which it is held liable the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21cf

each member of the 21cf consolidated group which prior to the transaction included 21cf the company and 21cf’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income and in certain jurisdictions state tax liabilities of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the transaction consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of what was previously the 21cf consolidated group the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the transaction requires 21cf andor disney to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that the company cannot quantify

introduction

the distribution

on march 19 2019 the company became a standalone publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by twentyfirst century fox inc now known as tfcf corporation “21cf” of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fox to 21cf stockholders other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21cf the “distribution” in accordance with the amended and restated distribution agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20 2018 by and between 21cf and 21cf distribution merger sub inc following the distribution 354328270 and 266173651 shares of the company’s class a common stock par value 001 per share the “class a common stock” and class b common stock par value 001 per share the “class b common stock” and together with the class a common stock the “common stock” respectively began trading independently on the nasdaq global select market in connection with the distribution the company entered into the separation and distribution agreement dated as of march 19 2019 the “separation agreement” with 21cf which effected the internal restructuring the “separation” whereby 21cf transferred to fox a portfolio of 21cf’s news sports and broadcast businesses including fox news media consisting of fox news and fox business the fox network fox sports fox television stations and sports cable networks fs1 fs2 fox deportes and big ten network collectively the “fox business” and certain other assets and fox assumed from 21cf the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities the separation and the distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the amended and restated merger agreement and plan of merger dated as of june 20 2018 the “21cf disney merger agreement” by and among 21cf the walt disney company “disney” and certain subsidiaries of disney pursuant to which among other things 21cf became a whollyowned subsidiary of disney 

pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement immediately prior to the distribution the company paid to 21cf a dividend in the amount of 85 billion the “dividend” the final determination of the taxes in respect of the separation and the distribution for which the company is responsible pursuant to the 21cf disney merger agreement and a prepayment of the estimated taxes in respect of divestitures collectively the “transaction tax” was 65 billion following the distribution on march 20 2019 the company received a cash payment in the amount of 20 billion from disney which had the net effect of reducing the dividend the company paid to 21cf the transaction tax included a prepayment of the company’s share of the estimated tax liabilities resulting from the anticipated divestitures by disney of certain assets principally the fox sports regional sports networks this prepayment was in the amount of approximately 700 million and is subject to adjustment in the future when the actual amounts of the tax liabilities are reported on the federal income tax returns of disney or a subsidiary of disney 

as a result of the separation and the distribution which was a taxable transaction for which the estimated tax liability of 58 billion was included in the transaction tax paid by the company fox obtained a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values this will result in estimated annual tax deductions of approximately 15 billion principally over the next 15 years related to the amortization of the additional tax basis this amortization is estimated to reduce the company’s annual cash tax liability by 370 million per year at the current combined federal and state applicable tax rate of 25 such estimates are subject to revisions which could be material based upon the occurrence of future events including among other things a refund of the prepayment discussed above 

in connection with the separation the company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the company’s relationship with 21cf and disney following the separation these include the separation agreement a tax matters agreement a transition services agreement as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses employee matters commercial arrangements and a studio lot lease see note 1 — description of business and basis of 

 

presentation to the accompanying financial statements of fox under the heading “the distribution” for additional information 

basis of presentation 

prior to the distribution the company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21cf the company’s financial statements as of june 30 2018 and for the years ended june 30 2018 and 2017 are presented on a combined basis as the company was not a separate consolidated group prior to the distribution these financial statements reflect the combined historical results of operations financial position and cash flows of 21cf’s domestic news national sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets and liabilities associated with such businesses  the company became a separate consolidated group as a result of the distribution and the company’s financial statements as of june 30 2019 and for the year ended june 30 2019 are presented on a consolidated basis 

the consolidated and combined statements of operations include allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within 21cf prior to the distribution and not recorded at the business unit level such as certain expenses related to finance legal insurance information technology compliance and human resources management activities among others 21cf did not routinely allocate these costs to any of its business units these expenses have been allocated to fox on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of combined revenues headcount or other relevant measures management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21cf are reasonable nevertheless the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by fox and may not reflect fox’s consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the entirety of the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if fox had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure the company estimates that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts allocated to fox in these financial statements through the distribution in accordance with sec guidance could range between 225 million and 250 million on an annual basis which costs include the impact of the initial grant of restricted stock units and stock options under the fox corporation 2019 shareholder alignment plan see note 11 — equitybased compensation to the accompanying financial statements of fox  this range is based on subjective estimates and assumptions and management expects the majority of any incremental costs to be included in the other corporate and eliminations segment the company expects its cash flows from operations together with its access to capital markets to be sufficient to fund these expenses

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations this discussion is organized as follows 









 



overview of the company’s business 

the company is a news sports and entertainment company which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments 







cable network programming and television 

the cable network programming and television industries continue to evolve rapidly with changes in technology leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where and how they consume content content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view internetdelivered content on televisions and portable devices these changes in technologies and consumer behavior have contributed to declines in the number of subscribers to traditional mvpd services and these declines are expected to continue and possibly accelerate in the future

at the same time expenditures by advertisers are affected by technologies that allow users to view programming from a remote location or on a timedelayed basis and provide users the ability to fastforward rewind pause and skip programming and advertisements furthermore the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending from more traditional media and toward digital and mobile offerings which can deliver targeted advertising more promptly or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising 

given these changes in technology and consumption habits the company believes its strength in “appointmentbased” content provides the company with a strategic advantage fox differentiates itself from its competitors by focusing on audiences at meaningful scale watching premium content in real time and by attracting sales from advertising customers who want to reach larger audiences within specified time parameters as the share of live news and sports consumption has increased across television viewing overall from approximately 23 of all live viewership in calendar 2014 to approximately 30 in calendar 2018 fox has strategically built one of the mostfollowed news and sports platforms in the country realtime consumption of live news and sports programming has increased approximately 9 from 2014 to 2018 fox’s franchises are leaders in these growing categories generating strong demand from both advertisers and traditional and digital mvpds as viewers increasingly move toward adfree or delayed viewing we believe the scale of our live audiences and premium nature of the content we deliver across our channels increasingly differentiate us from our competitors audiences engage with fox’s content in realtime and as a result our offerings have become more valuable to distributors and advertisers leading to higher revenues for fox in addition we have expanded the distribution of our premium content across digital mvpds nearly all of our networks are offered in all major digital mvpd services and we are cultivating direct interactions between fox brands and consumers outside of traditional linear television

 

the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is dependent to a large extent on the impact of changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies the sale of advertising on its cable and broadcast networks and television stations maintenance renewal and terms of its carriage affiliation and content agreements and programming rights the popularity of its content general economic conditions including financial market conditions the company’s ability to manage its businesses effectively and its relative strength and leverage in the industry for more information see item 1 “business” and item 1a “risk factors” included herein 

the company’s cable network programming and television segments derive a majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales for fiscal 2019 the company generated revenues of 114 billion of which approximately 49 was generated from affiliate fees 44 was generated from advertising and 7 was generated from other operating activities

affiliate fees primarily include i monthly subscriberbased license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry our cable networks and our owned and operated television stations and ii fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the fox network us law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the company to seek and obtain payment from traditional mvpds who carry the company’s broadcast signals

affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to us mvpds typically to facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straightline basis over the contract period traditional mvpds are currently the predominant means of distribution of the company’s program services while digital mvpds have become an increasingly significant share of overall distribution

revenues are impacted by rate changes changes in the number of subscribers to the company’s content changes in the expenditures by advertisers as well as the impact of state congressional and presidential elections cycles and of special events impacting advertising revenues such as the national football league’s “nfl” super bowl  which is broadcast on the fox network on a rotating basis with other networks major league baseball’s “mlb” world series  and the fédération internationale de football association “fifa” world cup  which occurs every four years for each of women and men and other regular and postseason sporting events delivered to consumers on the company’s broadcast television and cable networks

the most significant operating expenses of the cable network programming segment and the television segment are acquisition and production expenses related to programming marketing and promotional expenses and expenses related to broadcasting the company’s programming marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming additional expenses include salaries employee benefits rent and other routine overhead expenses

the profitability of us national sports contracts is based on the company’s best estimates at june 30 2019 of attributable revenues and costs such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant should revenues decline materially from estimates applied at june 30 2019 amortization of rights may be accelerated should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues the company may have improved results related to the applicable contract which may be recognized over the remaining contract term

other business developments

the following table sets forth the company’s operating results for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018

 



 



overview —the company’s revenues increased 12 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to higher affiliate fee advertising and other revenues the increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across all networks led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals the increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of fox’s inaugural season of nfl thursday night football “ tnf ” and an additional nfl postseason game on the fox network higher cyclical political advertising revenue due to the us midterm elections at the fox television stations and higher digital advertising revenue at fox news the increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the fox network 

operating expenses increased 13 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs including the additional nfl games and the recognition of a writedown of approximately 55 million related to entertainment and syndicated programming rights see note 5—inventories net to the accompanying financial statements of fox 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 17 primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2019 related to operating as a standalone public company following the distribution as compared to allocated costs in fiscal 2018 also contributing to the increase in selling general and administrative expenses were higher allocated costs of approximately 50 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 principally due to an increase in revenues which was the primary measure to allocate on a pro rata basis certain general corporate expenses from 21cf  in addition fiscal 2019 includes equitybased compensation costs of approximately 15 million related to the initial grant of restricted stock units and stock options under the fox corporation 2019 shareholder alignment plan see note 11 — equitybased compensation to the accompanying financial statements of fox

the company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 3 for fiscal 2018 was lower than the statutory rate of 28 primarily due to a provisional 607 million tax benefit which reflects the effects of the legislation in the us passed on december 22 2017 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements of fox under the heading “us tax reform”

net income —net income decreased 26 for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the absence of an income tax benefit resulting from the tax act in the prior year 

segment analysis 

the company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the company’s internal management structure which is organized based on operating activities the company evaluates performance based upon several factors of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization or segment ebitda due to the integrated nature of these operating segments estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets revenues and expenses 

beginning with the announcement of the company’s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the company has renamed as “segment ebitda” the measure that it previously referred to as “segment oibda” the definition of this measure has not changed segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses segment ebitda does not include amortization of cable distribution investments depreciation and amortization impairment and restructuring charges interest expense interest income other net and income tax expense benefit management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the company’s businesses 

management believes that information about total segment ebitda assists all users of the company’s financial statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company’s portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results total segment ebitda provides management investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data although historical results including segment ebitda and total segment ebitda may not be indicative of future results as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences 

total segment ebitda may be considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges which are significant components in assessing the company’s financial performance total segment ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

use of estimates

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements of fox under the heading “use of estimates”

revenue recognition

revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment

cable network programming and television

the company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the company’s network programming to be aired by television networks and cable channels and from sales of broadcast advertising time on the company’s owned and operated television stations and various digital properties advertising revenue from customers primarily advertising agencies is recognized as the commercials are aired certain of the company’s advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views referred to as impressions revenues for any audience deficiencies are deferred until the guaranteed number of impressions is met by providing additional advertisements advertising contracts which are generally shortterm are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month with payments due shortly after the invoice date

the company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with traditional and digital mvpds for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the company’s owned and operated television stations in addition the company generates affiliate fee revenue from affiliate agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the fox network and receive retransmission consent fees from traditional and digital mvpds for their signals affiliate fee revenue is recognized at a point in time when the network programming a functional license of intellectual property is made available to the customer which is done on a continuous basis for contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliate’s subscribers revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period for contracts with fixed affiliate fees revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the contract term which generally reflects the invoiced amount affiliate contracts are generally multiyear contracts with payments due monthly

the company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to mvpds to facilitate carriage of a cable network against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 606103225 through 27 “revenue recognition—consideration payable to a customer” the company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straightline basis over the contract period

programming 

costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing television broadcast network entertainment programming which includes acquired series coproduced series movies and other programs are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its total revenue estimates on a contract basis which may result in a change in the rate of amortization andor a writedown of the asset to fair value

as a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with the company’s programming rights the company recognized a writedown of approximately 55 million related to entertainment and 

 

syndicated programming rights at the television segment which was recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2019 

the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sporting events the costs of multiyear national sports contracts at the fox network and the company’s sports channels are primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period’s attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each contract estimates can change and accordingly are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary such changes in the future could be material the recoverability of certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on the fox network and the company’s sports channels is assessed on an aggregate basis

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company’s intangible assets include goodwill fcc licenses mvpd affiliate agreements and relationships and trademarks and other copyrighted products intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income

the company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles including goodwill amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method

carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc 350 “intangibles—goodwill and other” the company’s impairment review is based on among other methods a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the company to perform an interim impairment test

the company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition accounting and impairment testing the direct valuation method used for fcc licenses requires among other inputs the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the company owns television stations this method also involves the use of management’s judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the us broadcast industry the resulting fair values for fcc licenses are sensitive to these longterm assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material

during fiscal 2019 the company determined that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of fox as of june 30 2019 were not impaired the company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment

see note 8—goodwill and intangible assets net to the accompanying financial statements of fox under the heading “annual impairment review” for further discussion

 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income tax in various domestic jurisdictions the company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in making this assessment management analyzes future taxable income reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income

for information regarding the impact of the tax act see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements of fox under the heading “us tax reform”

employee costs

the measurement and recognition of costs of the company’s pension and opeb plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions

the company participates in andor sponsors various pension savings and postretirement benefit plans pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements prior to the separation and the distribution certain of the company’s employees participated in defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by 21cf “shared plans” which include participants of other 21cf subsidiaries shared plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans therefore no asset or liability were recorded to recognize the funded status in contemplation of the separation and the distribution the pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities of the shared plans allocable to the company’s employees were transferred to the company in fiscal 2019 see note 14 — pension and other postretirement benefits to the accompanying financial statements of fox

for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality the company considers current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the company considered the pension portfolio’s future return expectations of the various asset classes the expected longterm rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 50 equity securities 25 fixed income securities and 25 in other investments

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixed income investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2019 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following

 



 

discount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date the company will utilize discount rates of 37  and 32  in calculating the fiscal 2020 service cost and interest cost  respectively  for its plans the company will use a longterm rate of return of 70  for fiscal 2020 based principally on future return expectation of the plans’ asset mix the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2019 were  385 million which increased from 80 million as of june 30 2018 this increase of  305 million was primarily due to the transfer of pension benefit plan assets and liabilities allocable to the company’s employees f rom 21cf and the change in the discount rate assumption utilized in measuring plan obligations  lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear pension expense  higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear pension expense these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pen sion expense in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation “pbo” are recognized over the average f uture service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants 

the company made contributions of 83 million 30 million and 29 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2020 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 



fiscal 2020 net periodic pension expense for the company’s pension plans is expected to be approximately 50 million which is consistent with fiscal 2019
