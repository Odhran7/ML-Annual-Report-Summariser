overview 

edwards lifesciences corporation is the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the world’s leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring in the hospital setting edwards lifesciences has been a leader in these areas for over six decades since our founder lowell edwards first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining building and realizing a better future for patients 

a pioneer in the development of heart valve therapies we are the worlds leading manufacturer of heart valve systems and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve our innovative work in heart valves encompasses both surgical and transcatheter therapies for heart valve replacement and repair in addition our robust pipeline of future technologies is focused on the less invasive repair or replacement of the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart which are more complex and more challenging to treat than the aortic valve that is currently the focus of many of our commercially approved valve technologies we are also a global leader in hemodynamic and noninvasive brain and tissue oxygenation monitoring systems used to measure a patients cardiovascular function in the hospital setting 

cardiovascular disease is the numberone cause of death in the world and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects the structure of an individuals heart 

patients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process comorbidities and health status for example an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body a clinician may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically reshape and repair the faulty valve with an edwards lifesciences annuloplasty ring alternatively a clinician may implant an edwards lifesciences transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheterbased approach that does not require traditional openheart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat patients in the hospital setting including highrisk patients in the operating room or intensive care unit are candidates for having their cardiac function or fluid levels monitored by our critical care products through multiple monitoring options including noninvasive and minimally invasive technologies these technologies enable proactive clinical decisions while also providing the opportunity for improving diagnoses and developing individualized therapeutic management plans for patients

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world we manufacture our transcatheter aortic valve replacement transcatheter mitral and tricuspid technologies and structural surgical heart products primarily in the united states california and utah singapore costa rica and ireland we manufacture our critical care products primarily in puerto rico and the dominican republic 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products we manufacture our nonimplantable products from fabricated raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our replacement heart valves are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as fabricated materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of sole source availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered identified and approved for materials deemed critical to our products although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products incorporating animal tissue intended to be implanted in humans we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing to our patients quality products and have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial design concept risk management and product specification and continues through the design of the product packaging and labeling and the manufacturing sales support and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into the products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including leansix sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are frequently inspected by the many regulators that oversee medical device manufacturing including the united states food and drug administration fda european notified bodies and other regulatory entities the medical technology industry is highly regulated and our facilities and operations are designed to comply with all applicable quality systems standards including the international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a successful audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace and complying with all relevant regulations and medical technology industry standards through our corporate and site level environmental health and safety functions we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution prevent injuries and maintain compliance with applicable regulations in order to measure performance we monitor and report on a number of metrics including regulated and nonregulated waste disposal energy usage water consumption air toxic emissions and injuries from our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria 

research and development 

in 2021 we made significant investments in research and development as we worked to develop therapies that we believe have the potential to change the practice of medicine research and development spending increased 19 year over year representing 17 of 2021 sales this increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs including an increase in clinical research for our mitral and tricuspid therapies we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring 

a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and costeffectiveness data for payers clinicians and healthcare systems 

in transcatheter aortic valve replacement we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures 

in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies we are making significant investments in innovation and clinical evidence to develop technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases in addition to our internally developed programs we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing minimallyinvasive technologies to treat structural heart diseases 

our surgical structural heart development programs include innovative platforms for patients who are best treated surgically specifically active patients and patients with more complex combined procedures 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians this includes nextgeneration noninvasive and minimallyinvasive hemodynamic monitoring systems and a nextgeneration monitor platform we are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management including a semiclosed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels lastly we are developing a connectivity platform that will offer clinicians additional clinical support remote monitoring capability analytics and insights for their patients’ hemodynamic status 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states and israel our experienced research and development staff are focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations licensing opportunities and nondisclosure agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own or have rights to a substantial number of patents and have patent applications pending both in the united states and in foreign countries we continue to innovate and file new patent applications to protect our new products and technologies 

additionally we are a party to license agreements with various third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we undertake reasonable measures to protect our patent rights including monitoring the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

moreover we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the fda european union member states competent authorities and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products 

we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability including but not limited to those regulating employee health and safety labor competition trade secret and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position to date but new regulations or amendments to existing regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future we cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other regulatory standards additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may impose restrictions or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of medical devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to anyone including physicians as an inducement to purchase or recommend a product 

• the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider 

• federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 

• the physician payments sunshine act which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of united states physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers including medical device pharmaceutical and biologics companies 

• the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and 

• the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute united states companies for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties or for not keeping accurate financial records or maintaining adequate internal controls to prevent and detect arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we work to adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our business activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

regulation outside of the united states outside of the united states the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in may 2017 the european union the eu implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the medical device regulation mdr the mdr became fully effective on may 26 2021 and brought significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr requires recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards and has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial additional expense in addition in the eu we import some of our devices through our offices in switzerland switzerland is not a member state of the eu but is linked to the eu through bilateral treaties therefore the free movement of goods including medical devices between the eu and switzerland after implementation of the mdr requires a revised mutual recognition agreement mra if an mra covering the mdr is not put in place then noneu manufacturers may be required to make significant changes including replacement of swiss economic operators with operators based in eu member states and changes will need to be made to our device labeling andor packaging to satisfy mdr requirements if these measures are unable to be taken it may no longer be possible to place such devices on the eu market 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent japanese good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

• product standards and specifications 

• packaging requirements 

• labeling requirements 

• product collection and disposal requirements 

• quality system requirements 

• import restrictions 

• tariffs 

• duties and 

• tax requirements 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments increasing evidentiary demands and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the united states department of health and human services hhs and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility the cms national coverage determination for transcatheter aortic valve replacement was issued in june 2019 the modernized requirements and more streamlined patient evaluation process are meaningful enhancements that may help ensure equitable access for more patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may have a material impact on product pricing 

these laws or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures

failure to successfully innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner and effectively market these products could have a material effect on our prospects 

our continued growth and success depend on our ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner and effectively market these products without the timely innovation and development of products our products could be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or because of the introduction of a competitor’s newer technologies innovating products requires the devotion of significant financial and other resources to research and development activities however there is no certainty that the products we are currently developing will complete the development process or that we will obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all even if we timely innovate and develop products our ability to market them could be constrained by a number of different factors including barriers in patients treatment pathway including disease awareness detection and diagnosis the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications and uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement failure in any of these areas could have a material effect on our prospects 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be enrolled or completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or indication failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent analyses in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons and any such delay suspension or termination could have a material adverse effect on our prospects or the markets view of our future prospects 

we operate in highly competitive markets and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we face substantial competition and compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations product performance brand name recognition breadth of product offerings real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement in addition given the trend toward valuebased healthcare if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors our competitive position could be adversely affected see  competition  under  business  in part i item 1 included herein 

if we identify underperforming operations or products or if there are unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in connection with business acquisitions or strategic alliances we may be required from time to time to recognize charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we actively manage a portfolio of research and development products and we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances from time to time we identify operations and products that are underperforming do not fit with our longerterm business strategy or there may be unforeseen operating difficulties and significant expenditures during the integration of an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products and we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product in addition we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions and divestitures in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to developed technology andor inprocess research and development assets to the extent that the value of these assets decline we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired inprocess research and development assets any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the success of many of our products depends upon certain key physicians 

we work with leading global physicians who provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to appropriately engage these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input or we are otherwise unsuccessful in maintaining strong working relationships with these physicians the development marketing and successful use of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing logistics or quality problems our business could be materially adversely affected 

the manufacture and sterilization of many of our products is highly complex due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise for a number of reasons including disruption of facility utilities equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems cyber incidents or human error disruptions can occur at any time including during production line transfers and expansions disruptions can also occur if our manufacturing and warehousing facilities are damaged by earthquakes hurricanes volcanoes fires and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances as we expand into new markets and scale new products for commercial production we may face unanticipated delays or surges in demand which could strain our production capacity and lead to other types of disruption if any of these manufacturing logistics or quality problems arise or if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners otherwise fail to meet internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals and production could be delayed and our business could otherwise be materially adversely affected 

we rely on third parties in the design manufacture and sterilization of our products any failure by or loss of a vendor could result in delays and increased costs which may adversely affect our business 

we rely on third parties for a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design manufacture and sterilization of our products and we purchase certain supplies and services from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability constraints resulting from regulatory requirements and other reasons we may experience supply interruptions due to a variety of factors including 

• general economic conditions that could adversely affect the financial viability of our vendors 

• vendors election to no longer service medical technology companies due to the burdens of applicable quality requirements and regulations 

• the limitation or ban of certain chemicals or other materials used in the manufacture of our products and 

• delays or shortages due to trade or regulatory embargoes 

a change or addition to our vendors could require significant effort due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities it could be difficult to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to protect our information technology infrastructure and our products against cyberbased attacks network security breaches service interruptions or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results 

the operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to among other things effectively manage sales and marketing data accounting and financial functions inventory management product development tasks clinical data customer service and technical support functions our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes fires floods and other natural disasters terrorist attacks power losses computer system or data network failures security breaches and data corruption 

in addition our information technology infrastructure and products are vulnerable to cyberbased attacks cyberbased attacks can include but are not limited to computer viruses denialofservice attacks phishing attacks ransomware attacks and other introduction of malware to computers and networks unauthorized access through the use of compromised credentials exploitation of design flaws bugs or security vulnerabilities intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage in addition united states federal and state laws and regulations and the laws and regulations of jurisdictions outside of the united states such as the general data protection regulation adopted by the european union and the california consumer privacy act can expose us to investigations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities and claims from individuals potentially resulting in penalties and significant legal liability if our information technology security efforts are inadequate in addition we rely upon technology suppliers including cloud‑based data management applications hosted by third‑party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks 

significant disruption in either our or our service providers’ or suppliers’ information technology or the security of our products could impede our operations or result in decreased sales result in liability claims or regulatory penalties or lead to increased overhead costs product shortages loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information intellectual property or sensitive or personal information all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and operating results 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel 

our continued success depends in large part on our ability to hire and retain qualified people or otherwise have access to such qualified people globally and if we are unable to do so our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted see  human capital management strategy  under  business  in part i item 1 included herein competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions or other highly qualified personnel 

market and other external risks 

because we operate globally our business is subject to a variety of risks associated with international sales and operations 

our extensive global operations and business activity as well as the fact that many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are outside of the united states are accompanied by certain financial economic political and other risks including those listed below 

domestic and global economic conditions we cannot predict to what extent general domestic and global economic conditions may negatively impact our business these include but are not limited to credit and capital markets interest rates tax law including tax rate and policy changes factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment relating to health care these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers payers vendors and other stakeholders and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

health care legislation and other regulations  we are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our domestic and international business practices for example in the united states the affordable care act the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 and the 21st century cures act or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products in addition a mutual recognition agreement still under negotiation for the medical device regulation can result in a lack of free movement of medical devices between the european union and switzerland can impact our access in the european union and can ultimately have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information about these laws as they relate to our business see the section entitled “ government regulation and other matter s” in part i item 1 “ business ” 

in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments penalties resulting from any violation of these laws could adversely affect us and our business 

taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as other jurisdictions 

• provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes and our underlying effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our income tax provision could also be impacted by changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation federal and state tax credits nondeductible expenses changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability and creditability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

• tax reform  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted by changes in accounting principles or evolving tax laws including but not limited to global corporate tax reform and baseerosion and tax transparency efforts for example many countries are aligning their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plans that aim to standardize and modernize international corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder taxes transfer pricing documentation rules nexusbased tax practices and taxation of digital activities 

• tax audits  we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes although we regularly assess the likely outcomes of the audits and record reserves for potential tax payments the calculation of tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws and our estimates could be different than the amounts for which we are ultimately liable 

• tax incentives  we benefit from various global tax incentives extended to encourage investment or employment several foreign jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future if our incentives are not renewed or we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or part of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the tax incentives and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our provision for income taxes could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

other economic political and social risks in addition to the factors enumerated above we are from time to time impacted by a variety of other factors associated with doing business internationally that can harm our future results including the following 

• trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges 

• cultural or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers 

• differing labor regulations and 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations that is decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of sales outside of the united states has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect significant increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar could have a material adverse effect on our revenues cost of sales or results of operations 

if government and other thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers nearly all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and outside of the united states private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to our success the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

government and other thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services reimbursement levels may be decreased in the future additionally future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings and quality of life benefits instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

continued consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to drive consolidation and increase pricing pressure 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary intellectual property through a combination of patents and trade secrets we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we take are adequate to protect these rights 

• patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid 

• as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions 

• confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties intended to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies 

• others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information design around our technology or develop competing technologies 

• our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss theft damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events 

• we may not detect infringement 

• intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 

we spend significant resources to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in expensive and timeconsuming litigation that is complex and may ultimately be unsuccessful our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights which is typically costly and timeconsuming we may be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and if our defense is unsuccessful we could have significant liabilities to third parties or face injunctions that bar the sale of our products or could require us to seek licenses from third parties such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms may prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products or may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

in addition third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products negotiate licenses from such third parties which may be costly unavailable or require us to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we create study manufacture and market globally are subject to rigorous regulation and scrutiny by the fda and various other federal state and foreign governmental authorities government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of our products’ lifecycles including testing clinical study manufacturing transporting sourcing safety labeling storing packaging recordkeeping reporting advertising promoting distributing marketing and importing or exporting of medical devices and products in general unless an exemption applies a medical device or product must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals approval supplements or clearances if we are unable to obtain these required approvals we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale or recall or restrict the use of such modified device pay fines or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained 

regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly and their outcome is uncertain regulatory agencies may also change policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared approved or unregulated device our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements of the fda or other applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions these sanctions include among others warning letters fines civil penalties criminal penalties injunctions debarment product seizure or detention product recalls and total or partial suspension of production sale andor promotion any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales including as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to various united states and foreign laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance if we are found not to be in compliance we may be required to alter our practices or have sanctions imposed against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

in addition as a global company we are subject to global data privacy and security laws regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection use storage security transfer disclosure and other processing of personal data in the united states and in other countries which may include but are not limited to the health insurance portability and accountability act as amended hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the california consumer privacy act ccpa and the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr the gdpr imposes stringent european union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance hipaa also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed 

significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance ccpa provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures we or our thirdparty providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation 

additional risks related to government regulation are also described under  health care legislation and other regulations  in the risk factor above titled  because we operate globally our business is subject to a variety of risks associated with international sales and operations  

we may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical technologies our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing and assembly flaws design defects software defects medical procedure errors or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or information could result in an unsafe condition injury to or death of patients such problems could result in product liability medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future we establish reserves and may incur charges in excess of those reserves although we maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages we believe are adequate product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits fines and penalties in addition regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms these litigation matters and regulatory actions recalls or other actions regardless of outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is conducted in compliance with applicable laws and therefore is mainly limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur in the future expenditures in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes tornadoes seismic events wildfires or flooding such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment if such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and it may adversely affect our raw material sourcing manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to animal borne illnesses including “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of animal borne illnesses including bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue 

only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future

overview 

we are the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the worlds leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following areas transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies tmtt surgical structural heart surgical and critical care 

financial highlights and covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may further adversely impact nearly all aspects of our business and markets including our workforce and the operations of our customers suppliers and business partners our priority has been to maintain access for patients to our lifesaving technologies while providing continuous frontline support to our clinician partners and protecting the wellbeing of our employees our manufacturing operations have continued to respond to impacts related to covid19 and we have been able to supply our technologies around the world across the organization we are proactively managing inventory assessing alternative logistics options and closely monitoring the supply of components 

tavr and surgical procedure volumes varied greatly since the middle of march 2020 by geography and even by hospital as patients and their physicians analyzed the tradeoff between aortic stenosis and their concern for covid19 in the last few weeks of the first quarter of 2020 procedure volumes related to our tavr and surgical products dropped significantly beginning in the second quarter of 2020 procedure volumes improved in the second quarter of 2020 we also started to progressively resume patient enrollment in all clinical trials that were voluntarily paused or slowed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 while we saw improvements to precovid levels when we resumed enrollment procedure volumes and enrollment in our clinical trials were negatively impacted in late 2020 due to a resurgence of covid19 in critical care during 2020 there was greater demand in europe and the united states for our pressure monitoring products but demand for 

other critical care products began to decrease at the end of the first quarter of 2020 due to decreased hospital spending related to covid19 and that trend continued through the fourth quarter of 2020 

during the first quarter of 2021 covid19 stressed the global healthcare system during the winter months however we saw strong recovery beginning in the second quarter of 2021 as widespread vaccine adoption contributed to an increased number of patients however the delta variant had a significant impact on hospital resources during the last two months of the third quarter of 2021 and the omicron variant had a significant impact during december 2021 especially in the united states 

despite the challenges associated with covid19 our net sales for 2021 were 52 billion representing an increase of 8462 million over 2020 driven by sales growth of our tavr products during the first half of 2021 united states tavr procedures began to grow as covid19 hospitalizations decreased and vaccinations increased however tavr sales were negatively impacted in the second half of 2021 as united states procedures declined due to the significant impact the delta and omicron variants had on hospital resources  surgical sales grew during 2021 due to increased adoption of our premium highvalue technologies around the world and rebounding surgical aortic treatment rates in the united states we also saw an increased demand for our critical care products in 2021 as hospital capital spending continued to show signs of recovery and elevated covid hospitalizations in the united states and europe increased demand for our pressure monitoring devices 

our gross profit increase in 2021 was driven by our sales growth and lower incremental costs associated with covid19 the increase in our diluted earnings per share in 2021 was driven by our gross profit increase and an aftertax charge of 3051 million in 2020 to settle certain patent litigation related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products 

we are closely monitoring the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business and geographies including its impact on our customers employees suppliers vendors business partners and distribution channels the extent to which covid19 and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict these developments include but are not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak including new and more contagious variants of covid19 its severity the actions to contain the virus or address its impact the timing distribution public acceptance and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments united states and foreign government actions to respond to the reduction in global economic activity and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments despite the challenges of the covid19 pandemic our dedicated field teams found creative ways to support physicians our engineers continued to advance innovation and our colleagues worked diligently to keep our clinical trials on track  in 2021 we invested 173 of our net sales in research and development the following is a summary of important developments during 2021 

• we received united states food and drug administration fda clearance for the acumen hypotension prediction index software with the acumen iq finger cuff this is the first noninvasive solution that uses machine learning to alert clinicians of the likelihood a patient is trending toward hypotension or low blood pressure

results of operations 

net sales by major regions 

dollars in millions 



net sales outside of the united states include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities for more information see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

net sales by product group 

dollars in millions 



transcatheter aortic valve replacement 

the increase in net sales of tavr products was driven by 

• higher sales of the edwards sapien platform in 2021 in the united states europe and japan driven by improved covid19 conditions compared to 2020 sales however were negatively impacted in the second half of 2021 as united states procedures declined due to the significant impact covid had on hospital resources and 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which increased net sales outside of the united states by 339 million primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar 

in the second quarter of 2021 we 1 received approval for a united states pivotal trial for tavr in moderate aortic stenosis patients 2 received approval in japan to begin treating lowrisk patients with sapien 3  and 3 received sapien 3 ce mark approval to begin treating patients with a previously repaired or replaced valve in the pulmonic position in the fourth quarter of 2021 we 1 completed enrollment of our early tavr pivotal trial which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic aortic stenosis patients 2 initiated enrollment in our progress pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis patients 3 received fda approval for our alliance pivotal trial to study our next generation tavr device sapien x4  and 4 received fda approval for the use of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve with the alterra adaptive prestent for congenital heart patients the alterra prestent compensates for variations in size and morphology of the right ventricular outflow tract to provide a stable landing zone for the sapien 3 valve 

transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies 

the increase in net sales of tmtt products was due primarily to improved covid19 conditions compared to 2020 and continued adoption of our pascal system in europe 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we completed enrollment of our clasp iid pivotal trial studying edwards pascal in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation we continued to treat patients with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the encircle trial for sapien m3 and the miscend study for evoque eos the miscend study will evaluate the safety and performance of evoque eos  which is designed to advance the treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation with a lowprofile valve delivered through a sub 30 french transfemoral delivery system we also began treating patients with evoque in the triscend ii pivotal trial this study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the evoque tricuspid valve replacement system for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation 

surgical structural heart 

the increase in net sales of surgical products was due primarily to improved covid19 conditions compared to 2020 and increased sales of the inspiris resilia aortic valve and the konect aortic valved conduit primarily in the united states in 

addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales outside of the united states by 131 million primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar 

in january 2021 we received regulatory approval in japan for our mitris valve a new mitral valve incorporating resilia technology which was launched in japan during the second quarter of 2021 

critical care 

the increase in net sales of critical care products was driven by 

• increased demand for our capital products primarily hemosphere platforms in the united states as hospital capital spending continued to show signs of recovery 

• increased demand for our pressure monitoring products due to elevated covid hospitalizations primarily in the united states 

• increased demand for our enhanced surgical recovery products primarily in the united states and 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which increased net sales outside of the united states by 90 million primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar 

in june 2021 we received fda clearance for the acumen hypotension prediction index software with the acumen iq finger cuff this is the first noninvasive solution that uses machine learning to alert clinicians of the likelihood a patient is trending toward hypotension or low blood pressure 

gross profit 

the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven primarily by 

• a 05 percentage point increase in the united states due to an improved product mix driven by tavr products and 

• lower incremental costs associated with covid19 

partially offset by 

• a 05 percentage point decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts 

selling general and administrative sga expenses 

sga expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to 1 increased commercial activities primarily in the united states and europe compared to the covid19 impacted prior year 2 higher personnelrelated costs and 3 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which increased expenses by 222 million due primarily to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar 

research and development rd expenses 

rd expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to continued investments in our transcatheter innovations clinical trial activity also increased compared to 2020 since spending in 2020 was reduced as we temporarily paused certain mitral and tricuspid active pivotal clinical trials at the end of the first quarter of 2020 due to covid19 

intellectual property litigation expenses net 

we incurred intellectual property litigation expenses including settlements and external legal costs of 206 million and 4054 million during 2021 and 2020 respectively on july 12 2020 we reached an agreement with abbott laboratories and its direct and indirect subsidiaries abbott to among other things settle all outstanding patent disputes between the companies the “settlement agreement” in cases related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products the settlement agreement resulted in us recording an estimated 3679 million pretax charge and related liability in june 2020 related to past damages in addition we will incur royalty expenses through may 2024 totaling an estimated 100 million we made a onetime 1000 million payment to abbott in july 2020 and are making quarterly payments in subsequent years for further information see note 3 to the  consolidated financial statements  

change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities net 

the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in income of 1241 million in 2021 and expense of 136 million in 2020 the income in 2021 was driven by changes in the projected probability and timing of milestone achievements and the projected timing of cash inflows the expense in 2020 was primarily driven by the accretion of interest due to the passage of time and adjustments to discount rates partially offset by changes in the projected probability and timing of milestone achievements and the projected timing of cash inflows 

special charges 

for information on special charges see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

interest expense was 184 million and 158 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from lower capitalized interest due to decreased facilities construction 

interest income 

interest income was 174 million and 234 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower average yield partially offset by a higher average investment balance 

other income net 

in millions 

 

the net foreign exchange gains relate to the foreign currency fluctuations on our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances partially offset by the gains and losses on nondesignated derivative instruments 

the gain on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on investments in equity securities 

the nonservice cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost includes the costs of our defined benefit plans that are not attributed to services rendered by eligible employees during the year such as interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains or losses 

provision for income taxes 

 in millions 





our effective income tax rate in 2021 and 2020 was 117 and 102 respectively our effective tax rate for 2021 increased in comparison to 2020 primarily due to the impact of the litigation settlement agreement reached in 2020 with abbott to settle all outstanding patent disputes and the decrease in the excess tax benefit from employee sharebased compensation partially offset by the tax benefit from the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 

in 2021 the difference between our 117 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to 1 foreign earnings taxed at lower rates net of the united states tax on global intangible lowtaxed income 2 federal and california research and development credits 3 the excess tax benefit from employee sharebased compensation and 4 the tax benefit from the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 

as of december 31 2021 we had 1670 million of california research expenditure tax credits that we expect to use in future periods the credits may be carried forward indefinitely based upon anticipated future taxable income we expect that it is more likely than not that all california research expenditure tax credits will be utilized although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years into the distant future 

as of december 31 2021 our gross uncertain tax positions were 3584 million we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 1351 million from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amount of 2233 million if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

in the normal course of business the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities are in different stages of examining various years of our tax filings during these audits we may receive proposed audit adjustments that could be material therefore there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the eventual outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential 

liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2021 all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015 while not material we continue to address matters in india for years from 2010 

we executed an advance pricing agreement “apa” in 2018 between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various but not all transfer pricing matters the unagreed transfer pricing matters namely surgical structural heart and transcatheter aortic valve replacement collectively surgicaltavr intercompany royalty transactions then reverted to irs examination for further consideration as part of the respective years regular tax audits in addition we executed other bilateral apas as follows during 2017 an apa between the united states and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 and during 2018 apas between japan and singapore and between switzerland and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 we have filed to renew all of the apas which cover transactions with japan for the years 2020 and forward the execution of some or all these apa renewals depends on many variables outside of our control 

our united states federal income tax returns through 2014 have been audited the irs began its examination of the 2015 and 2016 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2018 and later added the 2017 tax year to this audit cycle during the first quarter of 2019 the irs audit field work for the 20152017 tax years was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2020 except for transfer pricing and related matters 

during the second quarter of 2021 we received a notice of proposed adjustment “nopa” from the irs for the 20152017 tax years relating to transfer pricing involving certain surgicaltavr intercompany royalty transactions between our united states and switzerland subsidiaries during the third quarter of 2021 we completed our review of the nopa and provided comments to the irs and the irs subsequently revised the nopa the revised nopa proposes an increase to our united states taxable income which could result in additional tax expense for this period of approximately 180 million and represents a significant change to previously agreed upon transfer pricing methodologies for these types of transactions 

we have formally disagreed with the nopa and have submitted a formal protest on the matter to the irs independent office of appeals during the fourth quarter of 2021 we also have received the final revenue agents report for these tax years we continue to evaluate all possible remedies available to us which could take several years to resolve no payment of any amount related to the nopa is required to be made if at all until all applicable proceedings have been completed we believe the amounts previously accrued related to this uncertain tax position are sufficient and accordingly have not accrued any additional amount based on the nopa received 

certain surgicaltavr intercompany royalty transactions covering tax years 2015  2021 that were not resolved under the apa program remain subject to irs examination and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of december 31 2021 we have considered this information as well as information regarding the nopa described above in our evaluation of our uncertain tax positions the impact of these unresolved transfer pricing matters net of any correlative repatriation tax adjustment may be significant to our consolidated financial statements based on the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and therefore have continued to record the uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability 

we have received tax incentives in certain nonunited states tax jurisdictions the primary benefit for which will expire in 2029 the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were 2080 million 033 per diluted share and 1892 million 030 per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years although congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified if the requirement is not modified it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in 2022 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash from operations and amounts available under credit facilities we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current and longterm requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

the 2017 act included extensive changes to the international tax regime the 2017 act required a deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits the onetime transition tax liability as adjusted is payable in four remaining annual installments as outlined in the contractual obligations table below as of december 31 2021 we had a remaining tax obligation of 2131 million related to the deemed repatriation see note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

as of december 31 2021 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside of the united states were 9034 million and 5634 million respectively during 2021 we repatriated cash of 11 billion we assert that 10 billion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested and our intent is to repatriate 3929 million of our foreign earnings as of december 31 2021 

we have a fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreement which matures on april 28 2023 the credit agreement provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies subject to certain terms and conditions we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement the credit agreement is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants including a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2021 

in june 2018 we issued 6000 million of 43 fixedrate unsecured senior notes the 2018 notes due june 15 2028 we may redeem the 2018 notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices as of december 31 2021 we have not elected to redeem any of the 2018 notes as of december 31 2021 the total carrying value of our 2018 notes was 5957 million for further information on our debt see note 10 to the  consolidated financial statements  

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2021 under the board authorized repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 56 million shares at an aggregate cost of 4985 million and as of december 31 2021 we had remaining authority to purchase 11 billion of our common stock in january 2022 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase 2500 million of our common stock for further information see notes 14 and 21 to the  consolidated financial statements  

certain of our business acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements payment of additional consideration in the future may be required contingent upon the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones such as attaining specified revenue levels or obtaining regulatory approvals for further information see note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  

in april 2021 we purchased an exclusive option to acquire a medical device company the investee for up to approximately 390 million depending on the paidin capital at closing per the agreement depending on the investees achievement of certain milestones we may be required to invest up to an additional 99 million in the investees equity securities and up to an additional 218 million for the option to acquire the investee of which we invested 108 million in 2021 upon achievement of the first milestone we also agreed to loan the investee up to 45 million under a secured promissory note for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

on july 12 2020 we reached the settlement agreement with abbott to settle all outstanding patent disputes between the companies in cases related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products the settlement agreement resulted in us recording an estimated 3679 million pretax charge in june 2020 related to past damages in addition we will incur royalty expenses through may 2024 totaling an estimated 100 million we made a onetime 1000 million payment to abbott in july 2020 and are making quarterly payments in subsequent years for further information see note 3 to the  consolidated financial statements  

consolidated cash flows  for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 17 billion for 2021 increased 6778 million from 2020 due to 1 improved operating performance in 2021 2 a higher bonus payout in 2020 associated with 2019 performance and 3 a payment of 1000 million in 2020 for a litigation settlement 

net cash used in investing activities of 17 billion in 2021 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 3258 million and net purchases of investments of 14 billion 

net cash used in investing activities of 5311 million in 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 4070 million and net purchases of investments of 876 million 

we currently anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately 300 million in 2022 as we continue to invest in our operations 

net cash used in financing activities of 3563 million in 2021 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 5128 million partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1586 million 

net cash used in financing activities of 4869 million in 2020 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 6254 million partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1405 million 

material cash requirements 

a summary of our material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 is as follows in millions 



 

a as of december 31 2021 we had recorded 2131 million of income tax liabilities related to the onetime transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 act the transition tax is due in eight annual installments with the first four installments paid in 2018 through 2021 the remaining installment amounts will be equal to 8 of the total liability payable in 2022 15 in 2023 20 in 2024 and 25 in 2025 see note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

b the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31 2021 was 410 million this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment returns on plan assets therefore we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table see note 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  for further information 

c purchase and other commitments consists primarily of open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the normal course of business we have excluded open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year for certain purchase and other commitments such as commitments to fund equity method or other investments the timing of the payment is not certain in these cases the maturity dates in the table reflect our best estimates 

d as of december 31 2021 the gross liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was 3860 million and relates primarily to transfer pricing matters which are discussed in detail in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 

e we acquire assets still in development enter into research and development arrangements acquire businesses and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone royalty or other future payments to thirdparties contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment we have included those payments in the table above however we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial we estimate that these contingent payments could be up to 8350 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations are met this amount includes certain milestonebased contingent obligations that may be paid through a combination of cash and issuance of common stock and certain salesbased royalties in excess of minimum payment thresholds related to litigation settlements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgments and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimates are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms sales rebates discounts and other incentives that we may offer which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize the estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition in limited circumstances we may allow customers to return previously purchased products such as for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

inprocess research and development assets acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

• discount rates used to present value the projected cash flows 

• the probability of success of clinical events and regulatory approvals andor meeting commercial milestones 

• projected payment dates and 

• volatility of future sales 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax credits net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the united states tax effects of global intangible lowtaxed income as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted 

legal contingencies 

we are or may be a party to or may otherwise be responsible for pending or threatened lawsuits including those related to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed by us workplace and employment matters matters involving real estate our operations or health care regulations or governmental investigations we accrue for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made but a range of probable losses can be estimated the lowend of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other if we determine that a loss is possible but not probable and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss these matters raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law as such significant judgment is required in determining our legal accruals we describe our legal proceedings in note 18 to the  consolidated financial statements  

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper united states and foreign government and agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2021 we had 23 billion of investments in debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of 129 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2021 would have resulted in a 153 million to 306 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

for more information related to investments see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2021 we had 6000 million of 2018 notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement based on our december 31 2021 variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in floating market interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense since we had no variable debt outstanding during the year as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 360 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt

overview 

edwards lifesciences corporation is the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the world’s leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care edwards lifesciences has been a leader in these areas for over six decades since our founder lowell edwards first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining building and realizing a better future for patients 

a pioneer in the development of heart valve therapies we are the worlds leading manufacturer of heart valve systems and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve our innovative work in heart valves encompasses both surgical and transcatheter therapies for heart valve replacement and repair in addition our robust pipeline of future technologies is focused on the less invasive repair or replacement of the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart which are more complex and more challenging to treat than the aortic valve that is currently the focus of many of our commercially approved valve technologies we are also a global leader in hemodynamic and noninvasive brain and tissue oxygenation monitoring systems used to measure a patients cardiovascular function in the hospital setting 

cardiovascular disease is the numberone cause of death in the world and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects the structure of an individuals heart 

patients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process comorbidities and health status for example an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body a clinician may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically reshape and repair the faulty valve with an edwards lifesciences annuloplasty ring alternatively a clinician may implant an edwards lifesciences transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheterbased approach that does not require traditional openheart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat patients in the hospital setting including highrisk patients in the operating room or intensive care unit are candidates for having their cardiac function or fluid levels monitored by our critical care products through multiple monitoring options including noninvasive and minimally invasive technologies these technologies enable proactive clinical decisions while also providing the opportunity for improving diagnoses and developing individualized therapeutic management plans for patients 

corporate background

transcatheter aortic valve replacement 

we are the global leader in transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies designed for the minimally invasive replacement of heart valves the edwards sapien family of valves  including edwards sapien xt the edwards sapien 3 and the edwards sapien 3 ultra transcatheter aortic heart valves and their respective delivery systems are used to treat heart valve disease using catheterbased approaches for patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and certain patients 

with congenital heart disease delivered while the heart is beating these valves can enable patients to experience a better quality of life sooner than patients receiving traditional surgical therapies we began offering our transcatheter heart valves to patients commercially in europe in 2007 in the united states in 2011 and in japan in 2013 supported by extensive customer training and service and a growing body of compelling clinical evidence our sapien family of transcatheter aortic heart valves are the most widely prescribed transcatheter heart valves in the world 

sales of our transcatheter aortic valve replacement products represented 65 63 and 61 of our net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies 

we are making significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases while many of these technologies are in early development and clinical phases the pascal transcatheter valve repair system and the cardioband systems for mitral and tricuspid valve repair are commercially available in europe the pascal system provides a differentiated minimallyinvasive therapy to address the needs of patients with mitral or tricuspid regurgitation through leaflet approximation while the cardioband system enables clinicians to restore a patient’s mitral or tricuspid valve to a more functional state by reducing the annulus and lowering regurgitation in addition to transcatheter repair we believe transcatheter replacement is key to unlocking the full mitral and tricuspid opportunity given the complex and diverse patient population our twoplatform strategy positions us for leadership in the midtolong term sapien m3 is based on the proven sapien valve paired with a novel docking system we are also continuing to advance our evoque platform for both mitral and tricuspid replacement both sapien m3 and evoque transfemoral delivery systems are sub 30french which has benefits for femoral puncture and septal crossing contributing to ease of use and patient safety 

surgical structural heart 

the core of our surgical tissue heart valve product line is the carpentieredwards perimount pericardial valve platform including the line of perimount magna ease pericardial valves for aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement with more longterm clinical publications on durability and performance than any other surgical valve perimount valves are the most widely implanted surgical tissue heart valves in the world our latest innovation the inspiris resilia aortic valve is built on our perimount platform and offers resilia tissue and vfit technology inspiris is now the leading aortic surgical valve in the world in addition to our replacement valves we are the worldwide leader in surgical heart valve repair therapies in 2020 we launched the harpoon beating heart mitral valve repair system  which can help transform care for many patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation we are also a global leader in cardiac cannula devices and offer a variety of procedureenabling innovations that advance minimally invasive surgery we believe the demand for surgical structural heart therapies is growing worldwide and that our innovation strategy will continue to extend our leadership and patient impact 

sales of our surgical tissue heart valve products represented 16 17 and 18 of our net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

critical care 

we are a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients heart function and fluid status in surgical and intensive care settings hemodynamic monitoring plays an important role in enhancing surgical recovery edwards’ complete hemodynamic portfolio helps clinicians make proactive clinical decisions that can improve patient outcomes and includes the minimally invasive flotrac system the noninvasive clearsight system and foresight the noninvasive tissue oximetry system we also support clinical needs with our wellestablished swanganz line of pulmonary artery catheters arterial pressure monitoring products and edwards oximetry central venous catheters  in conjunction with our sensors our hemosphere monitoring platforms display valuable physiological information in an easy to understand and actionable manner amplifying our sensor and monitoring platform portfolio is the addition of our first predictive algorithm acumen hypotension prediction index which alerts clinicians in advance of a patient developing low blood pressure 

sales of our core hemodynamic products represented 9 9 and 10 of our net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

competition 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies 

furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry we believe that we are competitive primarily because we deliver superior clinical outcomes that are supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance and reliability these superior clinical outcomes are in part due to the level of customer and clinical support we provide 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers 

  

we believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines in transcatheter aortic valve replacement our primary competitors include medtronic plc and abbott laboratories abbott in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies our primary competitor is abbott and there are a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in these fields in surgical structural heart our primary competitors include medtronic plc abbott and cryolife in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems se a subsidiary of getinge ab cheetah medical inc a subsidiary of baxter international and lidco group plc now part of masimo 

sales and marketing 

our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable cardiovascular device product brands in treating structural heart disease today we have a number of product lines that require sales and marketing strategies tailored to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to customers worldwide because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2020 

to ensure optimal outcomes for patients we conduct educational symposia and best practices training for our physician hospital executive service line leadership nursing and clinicalbased customers we rely extensively on our sales and field clinical specialist personnel who work closely with our customers in hospitals field clinical specialists routinely attend procedures where edwards products are being used in order to provide guidance on the use of our devices thereby enabling physicians and staff to reach expert proficiency and deliver positive patient outcomes our customers include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as service line leaders material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators and executives purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our product lines and where appropriate our corporate sales team actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states and european national and regional buying groups including healthcare systems and integrated delivery networks where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals and other providers by national healthcare systems 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces in 2020 57 of our net sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states 

international in 2020 43 of our net sales were derived internationally through our direct sales forces and independent distributors of the total international sales 52 were in europe 25 were in japan and 23 were in rest of world we sell our products in approximately 100 countries and our major international markets include canada china france germany italy japan and the united kingdom a majority of the sales and marketing approach outside the united states is direct sales although it varies depending on each countrys size and state of development 

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world we manufacture our transcatheter aortic valve replacement transcatheter mitral and tricuspid technologies and structural surgical heart products primarily in the united states california and utah singapore costa rica and ireland we manufacture our critical care products primarily in our facilities located in puerto rico and the dominican republic 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products we manufacture our nonimplantable products from fabricated raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our replacement heart valves are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as fabricated materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of sole source availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered identified and approved for materials deemed critical to our products although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products incorporating animal tissue intended to be implanted in humans we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing to our patients quality products and have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial design concept risk management and product specification and continues through the design of the product packaging and labeling and the manufacturing sales support and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into the products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including leansix sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are frequently inspected by the many regulators that oversee medical device manufacturing including the united states food and drug administration fda european notified bodies and other regulatory entities the medical technology industry is highly regulated and our facilities and operations are designed to comply with all applicable quality systems standards including the international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a successful audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace and complying with all relevant regulations and medical technology industry standards through our corporate and site level environmental health and safety functions we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution prevent injuries and maintain compliance with applicable regulations in order to measure performance we monitor and report on a number of metrics including regulated and nonregulated waste disposal energy usage water consumption air toxic emissions and injuries from our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria 

research and development 

in 2020 we made significant investments in research and development as we worked to develop therapies that we believe have the potential to change the practice of medicine research and development spending increased 1 year over year to 17 of 2020 sales this increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs including an increase in clinical research for our mitral and tricuspid therapies business we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring 

a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required postmarket approval studies involving applications of our 

products our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and costeffectiveness data for payers clinicians and healthcare systems 

in transcatheter aortic valve replacement we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures and developing pulmonic platforms to expand therapies for congenital heart disease patients 

in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies we are making significant investments in innovation and clinical evidence to develop technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases in addition to our internally developed programs we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing minimallyinvasive technologies to treat structural heart diseases 

our surgical structural heart development programs include innovative platforms for patients who are best treated surgically specifically active patients and patients with more complex combined procedures 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians this includes nextgeneration noninvasive and minimallyinvasive hemodynamic monitoring systems and a nextgeneration monitor platform we are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management including a semiclosed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels lastly we are developing a connectivity platform that will offer clinicians additional clinical support remote monitoring capability analytics and insights for their patients’ hemodynamic status 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states and israel our experienced research and development staff are focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations licensing opportunities and nondisclosure agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own or have rights to a substantial number of patents and have patent applications pending both in the us and in foreign countries we continue to innovate and file new patent applications to protect the full range of our products and technologies 

additionally we are a party to numerous license agreements with various third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we undertake reasonable measures to protect our patent rights including monitoring the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

moreover we own certain us registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european union member states competent authorities and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position to date but new 

regulations or amendments to existing regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future we cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other regulatory standards additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may impose restrictions or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of medical devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to anyone including physicians as an inducement to purchase or recommend a product 

• the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider 

• federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 

• the physician payments sunshine act which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of united states physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers including medical device pharmaceutical and biologics companies 

• the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and 

• the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute united states companies for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties or for not keeping accurate financial records or maintaining adequate internal controls to prevent and detect arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our 

compliance efforts we work to adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our business activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in may 2017 the european union the eu implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the medical device regulation mdr the mdr becomes fully effective in 2021 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr requires recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards and has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial additional expense in addition in the eu we import some of our devices through our offices in switzerland switzerland is not a member state of the eu but is linked to the eu through bilateral treaties therefore the free movement of goods including medical devices between the eu and switzerland after implementation of the mdr requires a revised mutual recognition agreement mra which continues to be under negotiation for the mdr if an mra covering the mdr is not put in place then noneu manufacturers may be required to make significant changes including replacement of swiss economic operators with operators based in eu member states and changes will need to be made to our device labeling andor packaging to satisfy mdr requirements if these measures are unable to be taken it may no longer be possible to place such devices on the eu market 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent japanese good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

• product standards and specifications 

• packaging requirements 

• labeling requirements 

• product collection and disposal requirements 

• quality system requirements 

• import restrictions 

• tariffs 

• duties and 

• tax requirements 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments increasing evidentiary demands and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the united states department of health and human services hhs and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility the cms national coverage determination for transcatheter aortic valve replacement was issued in june 2019 the modernized requirements and more streamlined patient evaluation process are meaningful enhancements that may help ensure equitable access for more patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may have a material impact on product pricing 

these laws or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

human capital management strategy 

human capital management hcm governance

business and operating risks 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats and epidemics including the novel coronavirus covid19 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats and epidemics including the global health concerns relating to the covid19 pandemic the global pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact nearly all aspects of our business and markets including our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers suppliers and business partners in particular we may experience material financial or operational impacts including 

• significant volatility or reductions in demand for our products 

• impacts and delays to clinical trials our pipeline milestones or regulatory clearances and approvals or 

• the inability to meet our customers’ needs or other obligations due to disruptions to our operations or the operations of our thirdparty partners suppliers contractors logistics partners or customers including disruptions to production development manufacturing administrative and supply operations and arrangements 

the extent to which the covid19 global pandemic and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results 

of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to 

predict these developments include but are not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak including new variants of covid19 its severity the actions to contain the virus or address its impact the timing distribution and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments us and foreign government actions to respond to the reduction in global economic activity and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

failure to successfully innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner and effectively market these products could have a material effect on our prospects 

our continued growth and success depend on our ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner and effectively market these products without the timely innovation and development of products our products could be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or because of the introduction of a competitor’s newer technologies innovating products requires the devotion of significant financial and other resources to research and development activities however there is no certainty that the products we are currently developing will complete the development process or that we will obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all even if we timely innovate and develop products our ability to market them could be constrained by a number of different factors including barriers in patients treatment pathway including disease awareness detection and diagnosis the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications and uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement failure in any of these areas could have a material effect on our prospects 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be enrolled or completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or indication failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent analyses in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be 

supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons 

we operate in highly competitive markets and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we face substantial competition and compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations product performance brand name recognition breadth of product offerings real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement in addition given the trend toward valuebased healthcare if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors our competitive position could be adversely affected see  competition  under  business  in part i item 1 included herein 

if we identify underperforming operations or products or if there are unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in connection with business acquisitions or strategic alliances we may be required from time to time to recognize charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we actively manage a portfolio of research and development products and we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances from time to time we identify operations and products that are underperforming do not fit with our longerterm business strategy or there may be unforeseen operating difficulties and significant expenditures during the integration of an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products and we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product in addition we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions and divestitures in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to developed technology andor inprocess research and development assets to the extent that the value of these assets decline we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired inprocess research and development assets any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the success of many of our products depends upon certain key physicians 

we maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to appropriately engage these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development marketing and successful use of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing logistics or quality problems our business could be materially adversely affected 

the manufacture and sterilization of many of our products is highly complex due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise for a number of reasons including disruption of facility utilities equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems or human error disruptions can occur at any time including during production line transfers and expansions disruptions can also occur if our manufacturing and warehousing facilities are damaged by earthquakes hurricanes volcanoes fires and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances as we expand into new markets and scale new products for commercial production we may face unanticipated delays or surges in demand which could strain our production capacity and lead to other types of disruption if any of these manufacturing logistics or quality problems arise or if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partner otherwise fail to meet internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals and production could be delayed and our business could otherwise be materially adversely affected 

we rely on third parties in the design manufacture and sterilization of our products any failure by or loss of a vendor could result in delays and increased costs which may adversely affect our business 

we rely on third parties for a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design manufacture and sterilization of our products and we purchase certain supplies and services from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability constraints resulting from regulatory requirements and other reasons we may experience supply interruptions due to a variety of factors including 

• general economic conditions that could adversely affect the financial viability of our vendors 

• vendors election to no longer service medical technology companies due to the burdens of applicable quality requirements and regulations 

• the limitation or ban of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and 

• delays or shortages due to trade or regulatory embargoes 

a change or addition to our vendors could require significant effort due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities it could be difficult to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyberbased attacks network security breaches service interruptions or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results 

the operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to among other things effectively manage sales and marketing data accounting and financial functions inventory management product development tasks clinical data customer service and technical support functions our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes fires floods and other natural disasters terrorist attacks power losses computer system or data network failures security breaches data corruption and cyberbased attacks cyberbased attacks can include but are not limited to computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks phishing attacks ransomware attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage in addition federal state and international laws and regulations such as the general data protection regulation adopted by the european union and the california consumer privacy act can expose us to enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities and potentially result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability if our information technology security efforts fail in addition a variety of our software systems are cloud‑based data management applications hosted by third‑party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks 

the failure of either our or our service providers’ information technology could disrupt our operations or result in decreased sales result in liability claims or regulatory penalties or lead to increased overhead costs product shortages loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information intellectual property or sensitive or personal information all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and operating results 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel 

our continued success depends in large part on our ability to hire and retain qualified people or otherwise have access to such qualified people globally and if we are unable to do so our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted see  human capital management strategy  under  business  in part i item 1 included herein competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions or other highly qualified personnel 

market and other external risks 

because we operate globally our business is subject to a variety of risks associated with international sales and operations 

our extensive global operations and business activity as well as the fact that many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are outside of the united states are accompanied by certain financial economic political and other risks including those listed below 

domestic and global economic conditions we cannot predict to what extent general domestic and global economic conditions may negatively impact our business these include but are not limited to credit and capital markets interest rates tax law including tax rate and policy changes factors affecting global economic stability the political environment relating to health care and the potential implications of the uk “brexit” or the withdrawal from the european union of other member 

countries these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers payers vendors and other stakeholders and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

health care legislation and other regulations  we are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our domestic and international business practices for example in the us the affordable care act the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 and the 21st century cures act or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products in addition a mutual recognition agreement still under negotiation for the medical device regulation can result in a lack of free movement of medical devices between the european union and switzerland can impact our access in the european union and can ultimately have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information about these laws as they relate to our business see the section entitled “ health care legislation ” and “ government regulation and other matter s” in part i item 1 “ business ” 

in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments penalties resulting from any violation of these laws could adversely affect us and our business 

taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as other jurisdictions 

• provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes and our underlying effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our income tax provision could also be impacted by changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation federal and state tax credits nondeductible expenses changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability and creditability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

• tax reform  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted by changes in accounting principles or evolving tax laws including but not limited to global corporate tax reform and baseerosion and tax transparency efforts for example many countries are aligning their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plans that aim to standardize and modernize international corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder taxes transfer pricing documentation rules nexusbased tax practices and taxation of digital activities 

• tax audits  we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes although we regularly assess the likely outcomes of the audits and record reserves for potential tax payments the calculation of tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws and our estimates could be different than the amounts for which we are ultimately liable 

• tax incentives  we benefit from various global tax incentives extended to encourage investment or employment several foreign jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future if our incentives are not renewed or we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or part of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the tax incentives and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our provision for income taxes could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

other economic political and social risks our future results could be harmed by a variety of other factors associated with doing business internationally such as those enumerated in these risk factors as well as the following 

• trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges 

• cultural or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers 

• differing labor regulations and 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations that is decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect significant increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar could have a material adverse effect on our revenues cost of sales or results of operations 

if government and other thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers nearly all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to our success the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

government and other thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services reimbursement levels may be decreased in the future additionally future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings and quality of life benefits instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

continued consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to drive consolidation and increase pricing pressure 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary intellectual property through a combination of patents and trade secrets we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we take are adequate to protect these rights 

• patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid 

• as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions 

• confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties intended to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies 

• others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information design around our technology or develop competing technologies 

• our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss theft damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events 

• we may not detect infringement 

• intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 

we spend significant resources to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in expensive and timeconsuming litigation that is complex and may ultimately be unsuccessful our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights which is typically costly and timeconsuming we may be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and if our defense is unsuccessful edwards could have significant liabilities to third parties or face injunctions that bar the sale of our products or could require us to seek licenses from third parties such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms may prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products or may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

in addition third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products negotiate licenses from such third parties which may be costly unavailable or require us to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we create study manufacture and market globally are subject to rigorous regulation and scrutiny by the fda and various other federal state and foreign governmental authorities government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of our products’ lifecycles including testing clinical study manufacturing transporting sourcing safety labeling storing packaging recordkeeping reporting advertising promoting distributing marketing and importing or exporting of medical devices and products in general unless an exemption applies a medical device or product must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals approval supplements or clearances if we are unable to obtain these required approvals we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale or recall or restrict the use of such modified device pay fines or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained 

regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly and their outcome is uncertain regulatory agencies may also change policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared approved or unregulated device our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements of the fda or other applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions these sanctions include among others warning letters fines civil penalties criminal penalties injunctions debarment product seizure or detention product recalls and total or partial suspension of production sale andor promotion any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales including as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

also we are subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance if we are found not to be in compliance we may be required to alter our practices or have sanctions imposed against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

we may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical technologies our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing and assembly flaws design defects software defects medical procedure errors or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or information could result in an unsafe condition injury to or death of patients such problems could result in product liability medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future we establish reserves and may incur charges in excess of those reserves although we maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages we believe are adequate product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits fines and penalties in addition regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms these litigation matters and regulatory actions recalls or other actions regardless of outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is conducted in compliance with applicable laws and therefore is mainly limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur in the future expenditures in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to animal borne illnesses including “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of animal borne illnesses including bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future

overview 

we are the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease as well as critical care and surgical monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the worlds leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require 

hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies tmtt surgical structural heart surgical and critical care 

on may 7 2020 our board of directors declared a threeforone stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on may 29 2020 to stockholders of record on may 18 2020 we distributed two newly issued shares of common stock to holders of record of each share of common stock to effect the stock split all applicable share and pershare amounts in this “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this stock split 

financial highlights and covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 as a pandemic covid19 continues to spread throughout the united states and other countries across the world and the duration and severity of its effects are currently unknown the global pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact nearly all aspects of our business and markets including our workforce and the operations of our customers suppliers and business partners our priority has been to support our clinician partners protect the wellbeing of our employees and maintain continuous access to our lifesaving technologies while offering frontline inhospital support our manufacturing operations have continued to respond to impacts related to covid19 and we have been able to supply our technologies around the world across the organization we are proactively managing inventory assessing alternative logistics options and closely monitoring the supply of components 

tavr and surgical procedure volumes varied greatly since the middle of march 2020 by geography and even by hospital as patients and their physicians analyzed the tradeoff between aortic stenosis and their concern for covid19 in the last few weeks of the first quarter of 2020 procedure volumes related to our tavr and surgical products dropped significantly beginning in the second quarter of 2020 procedure volumes improved in the second quarter of 2020 we also started to progressively resume patient enrollment in all clinical trials that were voluntarily paused or slowed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 while we saw improvements to precovid levels when we resumed enrollment procedure volumes and enrollment in our clinical trials have since been negatively impacted due to a resurgence of covid19 in late 2020 even though health systems adapted to the challenge the resurgence of covid19 late in 2020 continued to impact these patients who need care in critical care there was greater demand in europe and the united states for our pressure monitoring products but demand for other critical care products began to decrease at the end of the first quarter of 2020 due to covid19 and that trend continued through the fourth quarter of 2020 

despite the challenges associated with covid19 our net sales for 2020 were 44 billion representing an increase of 383 million over 2019 driven by sales growth of our tavr products 

our gross profit increase in 2020 was driven by a charge of 731 million recorded in 2019 primarily comprised of the write off of inventory related to strategic decisions regarding our tavr portfolio including the decision to discontinue our centera program 

the decrease in our diluted earnings per share in 2020 was driven by an aftertax charge of 3051 million to settle certain patent litigation related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments while some evidence collection was slowed due to the covid19 pandemic we and the clinical community are committed to continuing our trials and generating robust evidence in 2020 we invested 173 of our net sales in research and development the following is a summary of important developments during 2020 

• in response to the urgent covid19 response around the globe we temporarily paused new enrollments in our active pivotal clinical trials of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies which began resuming in the second quarter of 2020 

• we received ce mark for the edwards pascal transcatheter valve repair system for the treatment of european patients with tricuspid regurgitation 

• we received chinese regulatory approval for the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at high risk for or unable to undergo openheart surgery 

• we reached an agreement with abbott to settle all outstanding patent disputes between the companies in cases related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products 

• we received fda approval for the konect resilia aortic valved conduit the first readytoimplant solution for biobentall procedures a complex surgery that involves replacement of a patients aortic valve aortic root and the ascending aorta 

• we treated our first patient in the restore clinical trial which will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational harpoon beating heart mitral valve repair system in the united states and canada 

we are dedicated to generating robust clinical economic and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the current healthcare environment with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes 

results of operations 

net sales by major regions 

dollars in millions 



international net sales include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities for more information see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

net sales by product group 

dollars in millions 



transcatheter aortic valve replacement 

the increase in net sales of tavr products was due primarily to higher sales of the edwards sapien 3 ultra system following its regulatory approval in the united states december 2018 and in europe november 2018 the adoption of the edwards sapien 3 ultra system continued to be very positive in 2020 however our sales in 2020 were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic and these challenges have continued in early 2021 our procedure volumes dropped significantly beginning in march 2020 due to covid19 and began to steadily improve beginning in may 2020 in the first quarter of 2020 to ensure the safety of our employees and clinician partners from the threat of covid19 we decided to pause proctoring at centers that were not already trained on the edwards sapien 3 ultra system  in the second quarter of 2020 we resumed proctoring 

transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies 

the increase in net sales of tmtt products was due primarily to sales in europe of the edwards pascal transcatheter valve repair system which received ce mark in february 2019 our sales in 2020 were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic our procedure volumes for pascal dropped significantly in march 2020 due to covid19 and began to improve beginning in may 2020 

at the end of march 2020 we temporarily paused new enrollments in our active pivotal clinical trials of transcatheter 

mitral and tricuspid therapies in response to the covid19 response around the globe in the second quarter of 2020 we began 

resuming enrollments however due to a resurgence of covid19 in late 2020 we are experiencing a negative impact to clinical trial enrollment in may 2020 we received ce mark for the pascal ace implant system for mitral and tricuspid repair 

surgical structural heart 

the decrease in net sales of surgical products was due primarily to decreased sales of aortic tissue valves primarily in the united states and europe due to the impact of covid19 the ongoing adoption of tavr also contributed to the decrease in united states surgical aortic valve sales these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of the inspiris resilia 

aortic valve and the konect aortic valved conduit primarily in the united states increased and improved management of intensive care unit capacity as well as prioritization of heart surgery in many hospitals contributed to rebounding procedure volumes late in the second quarter of 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2020 hospitals experienced an influx of covid19 patients limiting surgical valve procedures 

in europe our harpoon beating heart mitral valve repair system became available commercially at the end of 2019 and the first commercial case was successfully completed in europe in the second quarter of 2020 in addition we received fda approval in april 2020 to begin our us pivotal investigational device exemption study harpoon offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients 

critical care 

the decrease in net sales of critical care products was driven by a decline in sales of our enhanced surgical recovery products primarily in the united states as many surgical procedures were delayed due to covid19 beginning in march 2020 we also experienced a decline in orders of our hemosphere advanced monitoring platform in the united states as hospitals limited their capital spending due to covid19 

these decreases in net sales were partially offset by increased demand for our pressure monitoring products primarily in europe and the united states as covid19 hospitalizations increased in addition our sales in 2020 and 2019 included 226 million and 168 million respectively related to cas medical systems inc casmed which we acquired on april 18 2019 casmed is a medical technology company dedicated to noninvasive monitoring of tissue oxygenation in the brain 

gross profit 

our gross profit was higher as a percentage of net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 in 2019 our gross profit was reduced by 731 million due to the decision to discontinue our centera program resulting in a 17 percentage point increase in 2020 compared to 2019 this increase was partially offset by a a 10 percentage point decrease in 2020 due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations net of hedging and b incremental costs associated with covid19 

selling general and administrative sga expenses 

the decrease in sga expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to a decreased sales marketing and travelrelated expense associated with covid19 and b lower performancebased compensation partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to transcatheter structural heart field personnel primarily in the united states 

research and development rd expenses 

the increase in rd expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to a investments in our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies and our aortic valve replacement programs and b costs associated with discontinuing our sutrafix program these increases were partially offset by a decreased spending on transcatheter aortic valve clinical trials and b decreased performancebased compensation 

intellectual property litigation expenses net 

we incurred intellectual property litigation expenses including settlements and external legal costs of 4054 million and 334 million during 2020 and 2019 respectively on july 12 2020 we reached an agreement with abbott laboratories and its direct and indirect subsidiaries abbott to among other things settle all outstanding patent disputes between the companies the “settlement agreement” in cases related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products see note 18 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information the settlement agreement resulted in us recording an estimated 3679 million pretax charge and related liability in june 2020 related to past damages in addition we will incur royalty expenses through may 2024 totaling an estimated 100 million we made a onetime 1000 million payment to abbott in july 2020 and will make quarterly payments in future years 

change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities net 

the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in expense of 136 million in 2020 and income of 61 million in 2019 the expense in 2020 was primarily driven by the accretion of interest due to the passage of time and adjustments to discount rates partially offset by changes in the projected probability and timing of milestone achievements and the projected timing of cash inflows the income in 2019 was due primarily to longer product development timelines which reduced the probability of milestone achievements partially offset by the accretion of interest due to the passage of time and discount rate adjustments 

special charges gain net 

for information on special charges and gains see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

interest expense was 158 million and 207 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from higher capitalized interest due to facilities construction 

interest income 

interest income was 234 million and 322 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower average interest rates partially offset by a higher average investment balance 

other income net 

in millions 

 

the net foreign exchange gains relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures 

the gain on investments represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on investments in equity securities 

the nonservice cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost includes the costs of our defined benefit plans that are not attributed to services rendered by eligible employees during the year such as interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains or losses 

provision for income taxes 





our effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was 102 and 103 respectively our effective tax rate for 2020 decreased slightly in comparison to 2019 primarily due to the tax benefit from the settlement agreement with abbott see notes 3 and 18 to the  consolidated financial statements  partially offset by the increase in the us tax on global intangible lowtaxed income and the decrease in the tax benefit from employee sharebased compensation 

in 2020 the difference between our 102 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to a foreign earnings taxed at lower rates b federal and california research and development credits and c the tax benefit from employee sharebased compensation 

as of december 31 2020 we have 1451 million of california research expenditure tax credits that we expect to use in future periods the credits may be carried forward indefinitely based upon anticipated future taxable income we expect that it is more likely than not that all california research expenditure tax credits will be utilized although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the distant future 

as of december 31 2020 gross uncertain tax positions were 2818 million we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 951 million from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amount of 1867 million if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the 

uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2020 all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015 while not material we continue to address matters in wisconsin and india for years from 2010 

during 2018 we executed an advance pricing agreement “apa” between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various but not all transfer pricing matters the unagreed transfer pricing matters namely surgical structural heart and transcatheter aortic valve replacement intercompany royalty transactions then reverted to internal revenue service irs examination for further consideration as part of the respective years regular tax audit in addition we signed agreements during 2018 with the irs to settle open tax years 2009 through 2014 including all transfer pricing matters for those years and the tax treatment of a portion of a litigation settlement payment received in 2014 

the irs began its examination of the 2015 and 2016 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2018 and later added the 2017 tax year to this audit cycle during the first quarter of 2019 the irs audit field work for the 2015 through 2017 tax years was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2020 except for transfer pricing matters 

as a result certain intercompany transactions covering tax years 2015 through 2020 that were not resolved under the apa program remain subject to irs examination and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of december 31 2020 the irs has signaled that it may be preparing proposed audit adjustments related to these intercompany transactions for the 2015 through 2017 tax years which if issued could be provided to us during 2021 we have considered this information in our evaluation of our reserves for uncertain tax positions 

these unresolved transfer pricing matters net of any correlative repatriation tax adjustment may be significant to our consolidated financial statements based on the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes to our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and therefore have continued to record the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability 

we intend to file to renew the apa between the united states and switzerland for the years 2021 and forward in addition we executed other apas as follows during 2017 an apa between the united states and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 and during 2018 apas between japan and singapore and between switzerland and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 we have filed to renew these apas related to japan for the years 2020 and forward the execution of some or all of these apas depends on a number of variables outside of our control 

we have received tax incentives in certain nonus tax jurisdictions the primary benefit for which will expire in 2029 the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were 1892 million 030 per diluted share and 1576 million 025 per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 included extensive changes to the international tax regime the 2017 act required a deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits the onetime transition tax liability as adjusted is payable in five remaining annual installments as outlined in the contractual obligations table below as of december 31 2020 we had a remaining tax obligation of 2387 million related to the deemed repatriation see note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

as of december 31 2020 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 6188 million and 7838 million respectively during 2020 we repatriated cash of 6000 million we 

assert that 11 billion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested and our intent is to repatriate 5998 million of our foreign earnings as of december 31 2020 

on july 12 2020 we reached the settlement agreement with abbott to settle all outstanding patent disputes between the companies in cases related to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid repair products the settlement agreement resulted in us recording an estimated 3679 million pretax charge in june 2020 related to past damages in addition we will incur royalty expenses through may 2024 totaling an estimated 100 million we made a onetime 1000 million payment to abbott in july 2020 and will make quarterly payments in future years for further information see notes 3 and 18 to the  consolidated financial statements  

on april 18 2019 we acquired casmed for an aggregate cash purchase price of 245 per share of common stock or 1008 million for more information see note 8 to the  consolidated financial statements  

certain of our business acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements payment of additional consideration in the future may be required contingent upon the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones such as attaining specified revenue levels or obtaining regulatory approvals for further information see note 8 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we have a fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreement which matures on april 28 2023 the credit agreement provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies subject to certain terms and conditions we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement the credit agreement is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants including a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2020 

in june 2018 we issued 6000 million of 43 fixedrate unsecured senior notes the 2018 notes due june 15 2028 we may redeem the 2018 notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices as of december 31 2020 we have not elected to redeem any of the 2018 notes as of december 31 2020 the total carrying value of our 2018 notes was 5950 million for further information on our debt see note 10 to the  consolidated financial statements  

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2020 under the board authorized repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 30 million shares at an aggregate cost of 6147 million and as of december 31 2020 we had remaining authority to purchase 6250 million of our common stock for further information see note 14 to the  consolidated financial statements  in february 2021 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase 2500 million of our common stock for further information see note 22 to the  consolidated financial statements  

consolidated cash flows  for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 11 billion for 2020 decreased 1286 million from 2019 due primarily to lower operating profits in 2020 and a payment of 1000 million for a litigation settlement partially offset by a payment of 1800 million in 2019 for a litigation settlement 

net cash used in investing activities of 5311 million in 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 4070 million and net purchases of investments of 876 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 5958 million in 2019 consisted primarily of a capital expenditures of 2544 million b net purchases of investments of 1749 million c a 1002 million net cash payment associated with the acquisition of casmed d a 350 million payment for an option to acquire a company and e a 240 million payment to acquire certain earlystage transcatheter intellectual property and associated clinical and regulatory experience 

we currently anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately 350 million in 2021 as we continue to invest in our operations 

net cash used in financing activities of 4869 million in 2020 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 6254 million partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1405 million 

net cash used in financing activities of 1156 million in 2019 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 2633 million partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1605 million 

contractual obligations 

a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2020 is as follows in millions 



 

a as of december 31 2020 we had recorded 2387 million of income tax liabilities related to the onetime transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 act the transition tax is due in eight annual installments with the first annual installment paid in 2018 the second annual installment paid in 2019 and the third annual installment paid in 2020 the remaining installment amounts will be equal to 8 of the total liability payable in fiscal years 2021 through 2022 15 in fiscal year 2023 20 in fiscal year 2024 and 25 in fiscal year 2025 see note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

b the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31 2020 was 529 million this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment returns on plan assets therefore we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table see note 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  for further information 

c purchase and other commitments consists primarily of open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the normal course of business we have excluded open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year for certain purchase and other commitments such as commitments to fund equity method or other investments the timing of the payment is not certain in these cases the maturity dates in the table reflect our best estimates 

d as of december 31 2020 the gross liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was 3012 million and relates primarily to transfer pricing matters during 2018 we executed an apa between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various but not all transfer pricing matters as a result certain 

intercompany transactions covering tax years 2015 through 2020 that were not resolved under the apa program remain subject to irs examination and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of the balance sheet date these unresolved transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements and the final outcome of the negotiations is uncertain management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 

e we acquire assets still in development enter into research and development arrangements acquire businesses and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone royalty or other future payments to thirdparties contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment we have included those payments in the table above however we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial we estimate that these contingent payments could be up to 8100 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations are met this amount includes certain milestonebased contingent obligations that may be paid through a combination of cash and issuance of common stock and certain salesbased royalties in excess of minimum payment thresholds related to litigation settlements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms sales rebates discounts and other incentives that we may offer which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize the estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition in limited circumstances we may allow customers to return previously purchased products such as for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the 

distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

inprocess research and development assets acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

• discount rates used to present value the projected cash flows 

• the probability of success of clinical events and regulatory approvals andor meeting commercial milestones 

• projected payment dates and 

• volatility of future revenue 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax credits net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the us tax effects of global intangible lowtaxed income as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units performancebased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term for performancebased restricted stock units expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved which requires judgment stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted 

legal contingencies 

we are or may be a party to or may otherwise be responsible for pending or threatened lawsuits including those related to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed as applicable by us workplace and employment matters matters involving real estate our operations or health care regulations or governmental investigations we accrue for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these matters raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law as such significant judgment is required in determining our legal accruals we describe our legal proceedings in note 18 to the  consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us and foreign government and agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2020 we had 9859 million of investments in debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 156 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2020 would have resulted in a 78 million to 156 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

for more information related to investments see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2020 we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement based on our december 31 2020 variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in floating market interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense since we had no variable debt outstanding during the year as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 432 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 10 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a subsidiarys functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts the total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2020 was 18 billion a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 1415 million any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts see note 2 and note 12 to the  consolidated financial statements  

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy at december 31 2020 all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any nonperformance by our current derivative counterparties 

concentrations of risk 

we invest excess cash in a variety of debt securities and diversify the investments between financial institutions our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 

in the normal course of business we provide credit to customers in the health care industry perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2020 we had no customers that represented 10 or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable net 

investment risk 

we are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our investments as of december 31 2020 we had 9859 million of investments in debt securities of various companies of which 7665 million were longterm in addition we had 351 million of investments in equity instruments of public and private companies should these companies experience a decline in financial performance financial condition or credit capacity or fail to meet certain development milestones including as a result of the impact from covid19 on their business or operations or otherwise a decline in the investments value may occur resulting in unrealized or realized losses

overview 

edwards lifesciences corporation is the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease as well as critical care and surgical monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the world’s leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care edwards lifesciences has been a leader in these areas for over six decades since our founder lowell edwards first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining building and realizing a better future for patients 

a pioneer in the development of heart valve therapies we are the worlds leading manufacturer of heart valve systems and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve our innovative work in heart valves encompasses both surgical and transcatheter therapies for heart valve replacement and repair in addition our robust pipeline of future technologies is focused on the less invasive repair or replacement of the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart which are more complex and more challenging to treat than the aortic valve that is currently the focus of many of our commercially approved valve technologies we are also a global leader in hemodynamic and noninvasive brain and tissue oxygenation monitoring systems used to measure a patients cardiovascular function in the hospital setting 

cardiovascular disease is the numberone cause of death in the world and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects the structure of an individuals heart 

patients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process comorbidities and health status for example an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body a clinician may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically reshape and repair the faulty valve with an edwards lifesciences annuloplasty ring alternatively a clinician may implant an edwards lifesciences transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheterbased approach that does not require traditional openheart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat patients in the hospital setting including highrisk patients in the operating room or intensive care unit are candidates for having their cardiac function or fluid levels monitored by our critical care products through multiple monitoring options including noninvasive and minimally invasive technologies these technologies enable proactive clinical decisions while also providing the opportunity for improving diagnoses and developing individualized therapeutic management plans for patients 

corporate background

sales of our core hemodynamic products represented 9  10  and 10 of our net sales in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

competition 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry we believe that we 

compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance and reliability customer and clinical support and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patients quality of life and a products costeffectiveness are additional aspects of competition 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers 

  

we believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines in transcatheter aortic valve replacement our primary competitors include medtronic plc and boston scientific corporation in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies our primary competitor is abbott laboratories and there are a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in these fields in surgical structural heart our primary competitors include medtronic plc abbott laboratories livanova and cryolife in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems se a subsidiary of getinge ab cheetah medical inc a subsidiary of baxter international and lidco group plc 

sales and marketing 

our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable cardiovascular device product brands in treating structural heart disease today we have a number of product lines that require sales and marketing strategies tailored to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to customers worldwide because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2019  

to help provide awareness of our products and technologies we conduct educational symposia and best practices training for our physician hospital executive service line leadership nursing and clinicalbased customers we rely extensively on our sales and field clinical specialist personnel who work closely with our customers in hospitals field clinical specialists routinely attend procedures where edwards products are being used in order to provide guidance on the use of our devices thereby enabling physicians and staff to reach expert proficiency and deliver positive patient outcomes our customers include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as service line leaders material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators and executives purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our product lines and where appropriate our corporate sales team actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states and european national and regional buying groups including healthcare systems and integrated delivery networks where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals and other providers by national healthcare systems 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces in 2019  58 of our net sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states

research and development 

in 2019 we made significant investments in research and development as we worked to develop therapies that we believe have the potential to change the practice of medicine research and development spending increased 21 year over year to 17 of 2019 sales this increase was primarily the result of significant investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs including an increase in clinical research for our mitral and tricuspid therapies business we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring 

a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and costeffectiveness data for payers clinicians and healthcare systems 

in transcatheter aortic valve replacement we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures and developing pulmonic platforms to expand therapies for congenital heart disease patients 

in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies we are making significant investments in innovation and clinical evidence to develop technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases and other structural heart conditions in addition to our internally developed programs we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing minimallyinvasive technologies to treat structural heart diseases 

our surgical structural heart development programs include innovative platforms for patients who are best treated surgically specifically active patients and patients with more complex combined procedures 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians this includes nextgeneration noninvasive and minimallyinvasive hemodynamic monitoring systems and a nextgeneration monitor platform we are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management including a semiclosed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states and israel our experienced research and development staff are focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 4700 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products among others 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the fda european community notified bodies and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical 

devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may impose restrictions or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming 

to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in may 2017 the european union the eu implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the medical device regulation mdr the mdr becomes fully effective in 2020 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr will require recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards and will result in substantial additional expense in addition in the eu we import some of our devices through our offices in switzerland switzerland is not a member state of the eu but is linked to the eu through bilateral treaties therefore the free movement of goods including medical devices between the eu and switzerland after implementation of the mdr requires a revised mutual recognition agreement mra which continues to be under negotiation for the mdr if an mra covering the mdr is not put in place then noneu manufacturers may be required to make significant changes including replacement of swiss economic operators with operators based in eu member states and changes will need to be made to our device labeling andor packaging to satisfy mdr requirements if these measures are unable to be taken it may no longer be possible to place such devices on the eu market 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments increasing evidentiary demands and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do 

business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of health and human services hhs in the united states and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility the cms national coverage determination for transcatheter aortic valve replacement was issued in june 2019 the modernized requirements and more streamlined patient evaluation process are meaningful enhancements that may help ensure equitable access for more patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care legislation in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states as part of the affordable care act the law included provisions that among other things created programs to encourage a shift to valuebased care required all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposed increased taxes the law required the medical technology industry to pay a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 through 2019 in december 2019 this legislation was repealed 

these laws or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 13900 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states singapore the dominican republic and puerto rico we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the sec additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in part i above 

business and operating risks 

if we do not introduce new and differentiated products in a timely manner our products may become more susceptible to competition or technologically obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and differentiated products our products could become more susceptible to competition or technologically obsolete and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or differentiated products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice barriers in the patients path to treatment uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors 

we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or differentiated products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items from third party vendors in the design manufacture and sterilization of our products our transcatheter aortic valve replacement transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies and surgical structural heart products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability constraints resulting from regulatory requirements and other reasons we also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical technology companies due to the burdens of applicable quality requirements and regulation although alternative supplier options are often considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

in addition for our suppliers located outside the united states trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing logistics or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture and sterilization of many of our products is highly complex due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise for a number of reasons including disruption of facility utilities equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems or human error disruptions can occur at any time including during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment as well as during production line transfers and expansions as we expand into new markets we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity and lead to other types of disruption also as we expand our manufacturing footprint significant delays in construction and process validation could impact our production capacity further scaling a new product for commercial production can sometimes be delayed if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing and warehousing facilities as well as those of our suppliers and logistics partners could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes volcanoes fires and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture store and distribute some of our products at other facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our assets or dispositions of business operations or for other reasons 

we manage a portfolio of research and development products from time to time we identify operations and products that are underperforming or not a fit with our longer term business strategy we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to developed technology andor inprocess research and development assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired inprocess research and development assets either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which are larger with better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new or differentiated products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies including drug therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical technology industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors in addition given the trend toward valuebased healthcare if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors our competitive position could be adversely affected see  competition  under  business  included herein 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be enrolled or completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyberbased attacks network security breaches service interruptions or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results 

the operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to among other things effectively manage sales and marketing data accounting and financial functions inventory management product development tasks clinical data customer service and technical support functions our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes fires floods and other natural disasters terrorist attacks power losses computer system or data network failures security breaches data corruption and cyberbased attacks cyberbased attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks phishing attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage in addition federal state and international laws and regulations such as the general data protection regulation adopted by the european union and the california consumer privacy act can expose us to enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities and potentially result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability if our information technology security efforts fail in addition a variety of our software systems are cloud‑based data management applications hosted by third‑party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks 

the failure of either our or our service providers’ information technology could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales result in liability claims or regulatory penalties or lead to increased overhead costs product shortages loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information intellectual property or sensitive or personal information all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and operating results 

market and other external risks 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax law including tax rate changes and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

various laws including the affordable care act the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 and the 21st century cures act or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products for more information about these laws as they relate to our business see the section entitled “ health care legislation ” in part i item 1 “ business ” 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as other jurisdictions our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could be impacted by changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation federal and state tax credits nondeductible expenses changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability and creditability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

our tax provision could be impacted by changes in accounting principles and tax legislation corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations in addition many countries are beginning to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices these changing tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits we have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions however the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which we are ultimately liable we would incur additional charges and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future the incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions we 

may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with anticorruption and antibribery laws our net sales originating outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 42 in 2019  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition a mutual recognition agreement still under negotiation for the medical device regulation can result in a lack of free movement of medical devices between the european union and switzerland can impact our access in the european union and can ultimately have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see  government regulation and other matters  under item 1  business  

substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies principally in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect significant increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar could have a material effect on our revenues cost of sales and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that 

prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical technology industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant selling research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary 

from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

continued consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if government and other thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

government and other thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings and quality of life benefits instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

we may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical technologies our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing and assembly flaws design defects software defects medical procedure errors or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or 

death of patients such problems could result in product liability medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information and continue to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical technology industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions that bar the sale of our products or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs further the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

the united states physician payment sunshine act and similar laws in other jurisdictions also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales including as a 

result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation and scrutiny in the future 

in recent years the medical technology industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical technology industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to animal borne illnesses including “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of animal borne illnesses including bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur in the future expenditures in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material

overview 

we are the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease as well as critical care and surgical monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the worlds leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies tmtt surgical structural heart surgical and critical care prior to 2019 tmtt and tavr had been reported together therefore prior periods have been presented to conform with the updated product categories 

financial highlights 

our sales growth was driven by our tavr products primarily the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve and the edwards sapien 3 ultra system  our 2018 surgical sales in the united states were reduced by a 825 million sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model 

our gross profit increase was driven by our sales performance noted above and was positively impacted by an improved product mix led by tavr products partially offsetting this increase was a charge of 731 million recorded in 2019 primarily comprised of the write off of inventory related to strategic decisions regarding our tavr portfolio including the decision to discontinue our centera program 

the increase in our net income and diluted earnings per share in 2019 was primarily driven by the aforementioned sales growth partially offset by a 2018 tax benefit and the charge in 2019 related to strategic decisions regarding our tavr portfolio 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments in 2019  we invested 173 of our net sales in research and development the following is a summary of important developments during 2019  



 we are dedicated to generating robust clinical economic and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the current healthcare environment with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes 

results of operations 

net sales by major regions 

dollars in millions 



international net sales include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities for more information see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

transcatheter aortic valve replacement 

the increase in net sales of tavr products was due primarily to 

 

 

partially offset by 

 

the march 2019 results of the partner 3 trial demonstrated superiority of sapien 3 tavr over surgery in the low risk patient population in august 2019 we received fda approval to expand use of the edwards sapien 3 and sapien 3 ultra transcatheter heart valve systems to the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis patients who are determined to be at low risk of openheart surgery given the approval for patients at low surgical risk and the continued excellence and versatility of our balloon expandable platform we decided to discontinue the centera program  while the centera valve has demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes and is performing well for patients the time and resources required to optimize deliverability and expand the indications to match the sapien 3 valve are significant in november 2019 we received ce mark to expand use of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve for the treatment of patients diagnosed with aortic stenosis who are at low risk for openheart surgery 

transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies 

the increase in net sales of tmtt products was due primarily to sales of the edwards pascal transcatheter valve repair system in europe which received ce mark in february 2019 

in mitral repair we continue to enroll our clasp iid us pivotal trial to study pascal in primary or degenerative mitral valve disease we also have initiated enrollment in our clasp iif pivotal trial for patients with secondary or functional mitral valve disease in september 2019 we received fda approval for our clasp iitr pivotal trial to study pascal in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation in the fourth quarter of 2019 we received fda approval for an early feasibility study to evaluate the safety and function of the edwards evoque tricuspid valve replacement system 

surgical structural heart 

the increase in net sales of surgical products was due primarily to 

 

 

partially offset by 

 

at the end of 2019 we received european regulatory approval for harpoon beating heart mitral valve repair system  and are in the process of beginning our commercial launch harpoon offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients 

  

critical care 

2019 compared with 2018 

the increase in net sales of critical care products was driven by our hemosphere advanced monitoring platform primarily in the united states partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 91 million  due primarily to the weakening of the euro and various other currencies against the united states dollar 

on april 18 2019 we completed the acquisition of casmed a medical technology company dedicated to noninvasive monitoring of tissue oxygenation in the brain our critical care sales for 2019 included 168 million related to casmed 

we received fda clearance in the third quarter of 2019 to use foresight  our cerebral oximetry technology on our hemosphere platform and have initiated the commercial launch 

gross profit 

the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by 1 a charge of 731 million related to strategic decisions regarding our transcatheter aortic valve portfolio including the decision to discontinue our centera program for further information see the  financial highlights  section above 2 the impact of multiple investments in our operations including an increase in costs to improve our manufacturing processes and 3 spending in support of the new european device regulations this decrease was partially offset by a 15 percentage point increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts 

selling general and administrative sga expenses 

the increase in sga expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to higher transcatheter structural heart field personnelrelated costs primarily in the united states and europe these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency which decreased expenses by 167 million primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the united states dollar the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to leverage from our higher sales performance 

research and development rd expenses 

the increase in rd expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to investments in our transcatheter structural heart programs including generating clinical evidence 

intellectual property litigation expenses income net 

we incurred intellectual property litigation expenses including settlements and external legal costs of 334 million and 2140 million during 2019 and 2018  respectively in january 2019 we reached an agreement with boston scientific to settle all outstanding patent disputes for a onetime payment to boston scientific of 1800 million  which was included as an expense in 2018 the settlement covers alleged past damages and no further royalties will be owed by either party 

change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities net 

the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in income of 61 million and 57 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the income was due primarily to longer product development timelines which reduced the probability of milestone achievements the income was net of expenses associated with changes in the fair value of the liabilities associated with adjustments to discount rates accretion of interest due to the passage of time and the 2018 achievement by valtech cardio ltd of a regulatory milestone for further information see note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  

special charges net 

for information on special charges see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

interest expense was 207 million and 299 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a lower average debt balance 

interest income 

interest income was 322 million and 320 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher average interest rates partially offset by a lower average investment balance 

other income expense net 

in millions 



the net foreign exchange gains relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures 

the gain loss on investments represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on investments in equity securities 

the nonservice cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost credit includes the costs of our defined benefit plans that are not attributed to services rendered by eligible employees during the year such as interest costs expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains or losses certain costs associated with realignments including settlements and curtailments have been included as a component of  special gains charges net  for further information see notes 4 and 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  

provision for income taxes 





our effective income tax rate in 2019 and 2018 was 103 and 51  respectively our effective tax rate for 2019 increased in comparison to 2018 primarily because of the increase in the us tax on global intangible lowtaxed income that became effective with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 act and the tax benefit in 2018 from audit settlements 

in 2019 the difference between our 103 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the foreign tax rate differential on foreign operations the recognition of excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation and federal and california research and development credits 



as of december 31 2019  gross uncertain tax positions were 2031 million  we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 501 million from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amount of 1530 million  if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2019  all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 during 2018 we signed agreements with the internal revenue service irs to settle tax years 2009 through 2014 

including transfer pricing matters and the tax treatment of a portion of a litigation settlement payment received in 2014 the irs began its examination of the 2015 and 2016 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2018 and its examination of the 2017 tax year during the first quarter of 2019 

during 2018 we executed an advance pricing agreement apa between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various transfer pricing matters and we have updated our transfer pricing policies accordingly certain intercompany transactions covering tax years 2015 through 2019 were not resolved and those related tax positions remain uncertain these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and therefore have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability 

in addition we executed other apas as follows during 2017 an apa between the united states and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 and during 2018 apas between japan and singapore and between switzerland and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 we are evaluating filing to renew some or all of these apas for the years 2020 and forward the execution of some or all of these apas depends on a number of variables outside of our control 

we have received tax incentives in certain nonus tax jurisdictions the primary benefit for which will expire in 2029 the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were 1576 million  075 per diluted share and 1449 million  070 per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

the 2017 act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 included extensive changes to the international tax regime the 2017 act required a deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits the deemed repatriation resulted in a 2639 million tax obligation as of december 31 2019 the onetime transition tax liability as adjusted is payable in six remaining annual installments as outlined in the contractual obligations table below see note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

as of december 31 2019  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 9098 million and 6071 million  respectively during 2019 we repatriated cash and notes receivable of 12 billion  we assert that 11 billion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested and our intent is to repatriate 1407 million of our foreign earnings as of december 31 2019 

on april 18 2019 we acquired casmed for an aggregate cash purchase price of 245 per share of common stock or 

1008 million  for more information see note 8 to the  consolidated financial statements  

certain of our business acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements payment of additional consideration in the future may be required contingent upon the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones such as attaining specified revenue levels or obtaining regulatory approvals for further information see note 8 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we have a fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreement which matures on april 28 2023 the credit agreement provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies subject to certain terms and conditions we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement the credit agreement is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants including a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2019  

in june 2018 we issued 6000 million of 43 fixedrate unsecured senior notes the 2018 notes due june 15 2028 as of december 31 2019  the total carrying value of our 2018 notes was 5944 million  for further information on our debt see note 10 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we reached an agreement with boston scientific to settle all outstanding patent disputes for a onetime payment to boston scientific of 1800 million  which was paid in january 2019 

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2019  under the board authorized repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 14 million shares at an aggregate cost of 2550 million  and as of december 31 2019  we had remaining authority to purchase 12 billion of our common stock for further information see note 14 to the  consolidated financial statements  

consolidated cash flows  for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 12 billion for 2019 increased 2526 million from 2018 due primarily to 1 improved operating performance in 2019 2 higher tax payments in 2018 related to an audit settlement and 3 a higher bonus payout in 2018 associated with 2017 performance partially offset by 1 a payment of 1800 million in 2019 for a litigation settlement and 2 higher working capital needs in 2019 

net cash used in investing activities of 5958 million in 2019 consisted primarily of 1 capital expenditures of 2544 million  2 net purchases of investments of 1582 million  3 a 1002 million net cash payment associated with the acquisition of casmed 4 a 350 million payment for an option to acquire a company and 5 a 240 million payment to acquire certain earlystage transcatheter intellectual property and associated clinical and regulatory experience 

net cash provided by investing activities of 767 million in 2018 consisted primarily of net proceeds from investments of 3420 million  partially offset by capital expenditures of 2387 million  

we currently anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately 400 million in 2020 as we continue to invest in our operations 

net cash used in financing activities of 1156 million in 2019 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 2633 million  partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1605 million

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection 

among acceptable alternatives under gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms sales rebates discounts and other incentives that we may offer which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize the estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition in limited circumstances we may allow customers to return previously purchased products such as for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

inprocess research and development assets acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

 

 

 

 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax credits net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the us tax effects of global intangible lowtaxed income as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 17 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units performancebased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock 

purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term for performancebased restricted stock units expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved which requires judgment stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of fixedrate debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us and foreign government and agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2019  we had 8940 million of investments in fixedrate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 10 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixedrate debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2019 would have resulted in a 46 million to 92 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

for more information related to investments see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2019  we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement based on our december 31 2019 variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense since we had no variable debt outstanding during the year as of december 31 2019  a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 447 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt

overview 

edwards lifesciences corporation is the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the world’s leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care edwards lifesciences has a proud sixdecade history as a leader in these areas since our founder lowell edwards first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining building and realizing a better future for patients 

a pioneer in the development of heart valve therapies we are the worlds leading manufacturer of heart valve systems and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve our innovative work in heart valves encompasses both surgical and transcatheter therapies for heart valve replacement and repair in addition our robust pipeline of future technologies is focused on the less invasive repair or replacement of the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart which are more complex and more challenging to treat than the aortic valve that is currently the focus of many of our commercially approved valve technologies we are also a global leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients cardiovascular function in the hospital setting 

cardiovascular disease is the numberone cause of death in the world and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects the structure of   an individuals heart 

patients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process comorbidities and health status for example an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body a clinician may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically reshape and repair the faulty valve with an edwards lifesciences annuloplasty ring alternatively a clinician may implant an edwards lifesciences transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheterbased approach that does not require traditional openheart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat patients in the hospital setting including highrisk patients in the operating room or intensive care unit are candidates for having their cardiac function or fluid 

levels monitored by our critical care products through multiple monitoring options including noninvasive and minimally invasive technologies these technologies enable proactive clinical decisions while also providing the opportunity for improving diagnoses and developing individualized therapeutic management plans for patients

transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies 

we are making significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases while most of these technologies are in early clinical phases the cardioband  systems for mitral and tricuspid valve reconstruction are commercially available in europe cardioband  enables clinicians to restore a patient’s mitral or tricuspid valve to a more functional state by reducing the annulus and lowering regurgitation 

competition 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance and reliability customer and clinical support and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patients quality of life and a products costeffectiveness are additional aspects of competition 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers 

  

we believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines in transcatheter aortic valve replacement our primary competitors include medtronic plc and boston scientific corporation in surgical structural heart our primary competitors include medtronic plc abbott laboratories and livanova plc in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems se a subsidiary of getinge ab and lidco group plc in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies our primary competitor is abbott laboratories although there are a considerable number of large and small companies with development efforts in these fields 

sales and marketing 

we have a number of product lines that require sales and marketing strategies tailored to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to all of our customers worldwide our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable cardiovascular device product brands in treating structural heart disease today to help provide awareness of our products and technologies we conduct educational symposia and best practices training for our physician hospital executive service line leadership nursing and clinicalbased customers 

because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors 

we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2018  

where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals and other providers by national healthcare systems we rely extensively on our sales and field clinical specialist personnel who work closely with our customers in hospitals field clinical specialists routinely attend procedures where edwards products are being used in order to provide guidance on the use of our devices thereby enabling physicians and staff to reach expert proficiency and deliver positive patient outcomes our customers include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as service line leaders material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators and executives purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our product lines and where appropriate our corporate sales team actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states and european national and regional buying groups including healthcare systems and integrated delivery networks 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces in 2018  55  of our net sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states 

international in 2018  45  of our net sales were derived internationally through our direct sales forces and independent distributors of the total international sales 53  were in europe 24  were in japan and 23  were in rest of world we sell our products in approximately 100 countries and our major international markets include canada china france germany italy japan spain and the united kingdom a majority of the sales and marketing approach outside the united states is direct sales although it varies depending on each countrys size and state of development 

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world we manufacture our transcatheter aortic valve replacement and structural surgical heart products primarily in the united states california and utah and singapore heart valve manufacturing facilities are also currently under construction in costa rica and ireland we manufacture our critical care products primarily in our facilities located in puerto rico and the dominican republic we manufacture our cardioband  transcatheter mitral and tricuspid reconstruction systems in israel with plans to transfer production to other edwards manufacturing locations 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products we manufacture our nonimplantable products from fabricated raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our replacement heart valves are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as fabricated materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of sole source availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work closely with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining uncompromised quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered identified and approved for materials deemed critical to our products although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products incorporating animal tissue intended to be implanted in humans we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing to our patients quality products and have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial design concept risk management and product 

specification and continues through the design of the product packaging and labeling and the manufacturing sales support and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into the products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including leansix sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are frequently inspected by the many regulators that oversee medical device manufacturing including the united states food and drug administration fda our european notified bodies and other regulatory entities the medical technology industry is highly regulated and our facilities and operations are designed to comply with all applicable quality systems standards including the international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a successful audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace promoting environmental excellence in our communities and complying with all relevant regulations and medical technology industry standards through our corporate and site level environmental health and safety functions we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution prevent injuries and maintain compliance with applicable regulations in order to measure performance we monitor and report on a number of metrics including regulated and nonregulated waste disposal energy usage water consumption air toxic emissions and injuries from our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria 

research and development 

we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring 

a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and costeffectiveness data for payers clinicians and healthcare systems 

in transcatheter aortic valve replacement we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures and developing pulmonic platforms to expand therapies for congenital heart disease patients 

our surgical structural heart development programs include innovative platforms for patients who are best treated surgically specifically active patients and patients with more complex combined procedures 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians this includes nextgeneration noninvasive and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems and a nextgeneration monitor platform we are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management including a semiclosed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels 

in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies we are making significant investments in the development of technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases and other structural heart conditions in addition to our internally developed programs we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing minimallyinvasive technologies to treat structural heart diseases 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states and israel our experienced research and development staff is focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 3900 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products among others 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the fda european community notified bodies and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in may 2017 the european union implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the medical device regulation mdr the mdr becomes fully effective in 2020 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr will require recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards and will result in substantial additional expense 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments increasing evidentiary demands and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of health and human services hhs in the united states and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility currently cms is reviewing the national coverage determination for transcatheter aortic valve replacement that has been in place since 2012 an updated final policy is expected to be issued in 2019 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care legislation in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states as part of the affordable care act aca the law included provisions that among other things created programs to encourage a shift to valuebased care required all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposed increased taxes the law requires the medical technology industry to pay a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 through 2019 

these laws or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 12800  employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states singapore the dominican republic and puerto rico we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees

business and operating risks 

if we do not introduce new and differentiated products in a timely manner our products may become more susceptible to competition or technologically obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and differentiated products our products could become more susceptible to competition or technologically obsolete and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or differentiated products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or differentiated products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items from third party vendors in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical structural heart transcatheter aortic valve replacement and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we 

purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical technology companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the sec enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if we find that certain minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of our products directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing logistics or quality problems including as a result of natural disasters our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including disruption of facility utilities equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems or human error although closely managed disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment as well as during production line transfers and expansions as we expand into new markets we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity also as we expand our manufacturing footprint significant delays in construction and process validation could impact our production capacity further scaling a new product for commercial production can sometimes be delayed if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing and warehousing facilities as well as those of our suppliers and logistics partners could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes volcanoes fires and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture store and distribute some of our products at other facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our assets or dispositions of business operations or for other reasons 

we manage a portfolio of research and development products from time to time we identify operations and products that are underperforming or not a fit with our longer term business strategy we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to developed technology andor inprocess research and development iprd assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired iprd either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which are larger with better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new or differentiated products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical technology industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors in addition given the trend toward valuebased healthcare if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors our competitive position could be adversely affected see  competition  under  business  included herein 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be enrolled or completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyberbased attacks network security breaches service interruptions or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results   

the operation of our business depends on our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems to among other things effectively manage sales and marketing data accounting and financial functions inventory management product development tasks clinical data customer service and technical support functions our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes fires floods and other natural disasters terrorist attacks power losses computer system or data network failures security breaches data corruption and cyberbased attacks cyberbased attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage in addition federal state and international laws and regulations such as the general data protection regulation adopted by the european union can expose us to enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities and potentially result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability if our information technology security efforts fail in addition a variety of our software systems are cloud‑based data management applications hosted by third‑party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks 

the failure of either our or our service providers’ information technology could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales increased overhead costs product shortages loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information intellectual property or sensitive or personal information all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and operating results 

market and other external risks 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax law including tax rate changes and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

various laws including the affordable care act the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 and the 21st century cures act or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products for more information about these laws as they relate to our business see the section entitled “ health care legislation ” in part i item 1 “ business ” 

in addition public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act has resulted in significant changes to the us corporate income tax system these changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35 to 21 various new international provisions the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation the 2017 tax act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonus 

earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to us taxation as global intangible lowtaxed income these changes became effective beginning in 2018 

the 2017 tax act also includes the transition toll tax which is a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries previously untaxed foreign earnings the transition toll tax will be paid over an eightyear period that began in 2018 and will not accrue interest in addition subsequent us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 tax act could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with anticorruption and antibribery laws our net sales originating outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 45  in 2018  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies principally in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect significant increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar could have a material effect on our revenues cost of sales and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical technology industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant selling research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary 

from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

continued consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations   

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if government and other thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

government and other thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

we may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical technologies our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing and assembly flaws design defects software defects medical procedure errors or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or 

death of patients such problems could result in product liability medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical technology industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions that bar the sale of our products or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the united states physician payment sunshine act and similar laws in other jurisdictions also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with 

applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical technology industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical technology industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur in the future expenditures in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material

overview 

we are the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the worlds leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or who require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas transcatheter heart valve therapy thvt surgical heart valve therapy shvt and critical care beginning in 2019 we will report our sales in four main areas transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgical structural heart critical care and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies tmtt going forward tmtt will be reported as a separate product category to allow greater visibility into our performance in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies 

financial highlights 

our sales growth was led by our thvt products primarily due to increased sales of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve across all regions primarily the united states and our critical care products primarily the introduction of our hemosphere  advanced monitoring platform in the united states our 2018 shvt net sales in the united states decreased compared to 2017 primarily related to a 825 million sales return reserve related to our conversion to a consignment inventory model for surgical valves our gross profit margin in 2018 and 2017 was positively impacted by an improved product mix led by thvt products 

the increase in our net income in 2018 was primarily driven by the aforementioned operating performance combined with tax benefits from a reduction in the us federal corporate rate from 35 to 21 and the settlement of tax audits this increase was partially offset by charges for a litigation settlement and impairment of intangible assets the increase in our net income in 2017 was primarily driven by our increased sales and a gain from litigation related to the theft of trade secrets partially offset by increased tax expenses associated with the tax cuts and jobs act

interest income was 320 million  203 million  and 108 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in interest income for 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rates for 2018  2017  and 2016  were impacted as follows in millions 



  

on december 22 2017 public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 act was signed into law the 2017 act 1 reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 2 required companies to pay a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and 3 created new taxes on certain foreign earnings in future years 

on december 22 2017 staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 was issued to address the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 act in accordance with sab 118 as of december 31 2017 we estimated provisional amounts for 1 33 million of tax benefits in connection with the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities 2 2974 million of net tax expense recorded in connection with the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and 3 323 million of tax benefits associated with a tax reform related restructuring in accordance with sab 118 during 2018 we adjusted the provisional amounts as described below 

as a result of internal revenue service irs guidance issued subsequent to the 2017 act the 323 million of tax benefits associated with the tax reform related restructuring mentioned above were reversed in addition during 2018 we recorded a 128 million reduction in the repatriation tax and an additional benefit of 37 million in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets in accordance with sab 118 we completed our accounting for the 2017 act during the fourth quarter of 2018 

our effective tax rate for 2018 is lower than our effective tax rate for 2017 primarily because of the benefit from the reduction in the us federal corporate rate from 35 to 21 and tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits in addition the effective rate for 2017 included the onetime impact of the mandatory taxation of previously unrepatriated earnings partially offset by the revaluation of taxrelated balance sheet items due to the us tax rate changes required by the 2017 act 

uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  gross uncertain tax positions were 1507 million  and 2256 million  respectively we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 427 million  and 940 million  respectively from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amounts of 1080 million  and 1316 million  respectively if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions excluding interest penalties and foreign exchange is as follows in millions 



the table above summarizes the gross amounts of uncertain tax positions without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such uncertain tax positions were settled 

we recognize interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2018  we had accrued 46 million  net of 19 million  tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of december 31 2017  we had accrued 74 million  net of 29 million  tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions during 2018  2017  and 2016  we recognized interest benefit expense net of tax benefit of 28 million  73 million  and 40 million  respectively in “ provision for income taxes ” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2018  all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 during 2018 we signed agreements with the irs to settle tax years 2009 through 2014 including transfer pricing matters and the tax treatment of a portion of a litigation settlement payment received in 2014 the irs began its examination of the 2015 and 2016 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2018 

during 2018 we executed an advance pricing agreement apa between the united states and switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various transfer pricing matters and we have updated our transfer pricing policies accordingly certain intercompany transactions covering tax years 2015 through 2018 were not resolved and those related tax positions remain uncertain these transfer pricing matters may be significant to our consolidated financial statements in addition we executed other apas as follows during 2017 an apa between the united states and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 and during 2018 apas between japan and singapore as well as switzerland and japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019 

based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability 

we have received tax incentives in certain nonus tax jurisdictions the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024 the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were 1449 million   070  per diluted share 810 million   039  per diluted share and 787 million   032  per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

our dominican republic branch receives tax incentives including an exemption from paying dominican republic income taxes under a free trade zone law effective november 9 2012 the dominican republic enacted a law which among other tax provisions would apply a 10 withholding tax on dividends or branch remittances from a free trade zone company to its shareholders the dominican republic withholding tax provision was however contingent upon certain future events on october 5 2016 the dominican republic ministry of finance published a notification confirming that the 10 withholding tax on branch remittances would be due and payable by dominican republic free trade zone companies for dividends and remittances paid on or after october 5 2016 the impact of this withholding tax has been reflected in our income tax provision 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

the 2017 act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 included extensive changes to the international tax regime the 2017 act required a deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits the deemed repatriation resulted in a 2705 million tax obligation as of december 31 2018 the onetime transition tax liability as adjusted is payable in seven remaining annual installments as outlined in the contractual obligations table below see note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

as of december 31 2018  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 6593 million  and 2972 million  respectively during 2018 we repatriated cash and shortterm investments of 14 billion  we assert that 11 billion  of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested and our intent is to repatriate 06 billion  of our foreign earnings as of december 31 2018 

certain of our business acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements payment of additional consideration in the future may be required contingent upon the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones such as attaining specified revenue levels or obtaining regulatory approvals for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

in april 2018 we entered into a new fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreement which matures on april 28 2023 and the previous fiveyear credit agreement was terminated the credit agreement provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million  in borrowings in multiple currencies subject to certain terms and conditions we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement by up to an additional 2500 million  in the aggregate as of december 31 2018  there were no  borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement the credit agreement is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants including a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2018 

in october 2013 we issued 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes the 2013 notes due october 15 2018 the 2013 notes were repaid in october 2018 in june 2018 we issued 6000 million  of 43  fixedrate unsecured senior notes the 2018 notes due june 15 2028 a portion of the proceeds from the 2018 notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under our previous fiveyear credit agreement and the remainder was used to partially repay the maturing 2013 notes and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2018  the total carrying value of our 2018 notes was 5938 million  for further information on our debt see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we reached an agreement with boston scientific to settle all outstanding patent disputes for a onetime payment to boston scientific of 1800 million  which was paid in january 2019 

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2018  under the board 

authorized repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 54 million  shares at an aggregate cost of 7843 million  and as of december 31 2018  we had remaining authority to purchase 05 billion  of our common stock for further information see note 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  

consolidated cash flows  for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016   

       

net cash flows provided by operating activities  of 9268 million  for 2018   decreased   739 million  from 2017  due primarily to higher tax payments and a higher bonus payout in 2018 associated with 2017 performance partially offset by improved operating performance in 2018 and higher working capital needs in 2017 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 10 billion  for 2017   increased   2963 million  from 2016  due primarily to improved operating performance and receipt of a litigation payment partially offset by higher working capital needs associated with growth in the business and the timing of tax payments 

net cash provided by investing activities  of 767 million  in 2018  consisted primarily of net proceeds from  investments of 3232 million  partially offset by capital expenditures of 2387 million  

net cash used in investing activities of 6472 million  in 2017  consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of 2357 million  capital expenditures of 1681 million  a 1000 million  net cash payment associated with the acquisition of harpoon medical inc and an 819 million  net cash payment associated with the acquisition of valtech cardio ltd

a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  is as follows in millions 



 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms sales rebates discounts and other incentives that we may offer which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize the estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition in limited circumstances we may allow customers to return previously purchased products such as for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

iprd acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts 

of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax credits net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the us tax effects of global intangible lowtaxed income gilti as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units performancebased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term for performancebased restricted stock units expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved which requires judgment stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of 

estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of fixedrate debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us and foreign government and agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2018  we had 7262 million  of investments in fixedrate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 10 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixedrate debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2018  would have resulted in a 35 million to 70 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 6 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2018  we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2018  there were no  borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement based on our december 31 2018  variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately 60 million most of which would be offset by increased returns on our shortterm investments the impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2018  a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 447 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts the total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2018  was 14 billion  a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 612 million any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts see note 2 and note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy at december 31 2018  all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any nonperformance by our current derivative counterparties 

concentrations of risk

sales of our core hemodynamic products represented 10  12  and 13  of our net sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

competition 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance and reliability customer and clinical support and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patients quality of life and a products costeffectiveness are additional aspects of competition 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers 

  

we believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines in transcatheter heart valve therapy our primary competitors include medtronic plc boston scientific corporation and abbott laboratories in surgical heart valve therapy our primary competitors include medtronic plc abbott laboratories and livanova plc in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems se a subsidiary of getinge ab and lidco group plc 

sales and marketing 

we have a number of broad product lines that require a sales and marketing strategy tailored to our customers in order to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to all of our customers worldwide our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable cardiovascular device product brands in treating structural heart disease today to help broaden awareness of our products and technologies we conduct educational symposia and provide training to our physician hospital executive service line leadership and clinicalbased customers 

because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2017  

where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals by national healthcare systems we rely extensively on our sales and field clinical specialist personnel who work in hospitals closely with our customers our customers include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as service line leaders material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators and executives purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our products and where appropriate our 

corporate sales team actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states and european national and regional buying groups including healthcare systems and integrated delivery networks 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces in 2017  56  of our sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states 

international in 2017  44  of our sales were derived internationally through our direct sales forces and independent distributors of the total international sales 54  were in europe 23  were in japan and 23  were in rest of world we sell our products in approximately 100 countries and our major international markets include canada china france germany italy japan spain and the united kingdom a majority of the sales and marketing approach outside the united states is direct sales although it varies depending on each countrys size and state of development 

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world our transcatheter heart valve therapy and surgical heart valve therapy products are manufactured primarily in the united states california and utah and singapore a heart valve manufacturing facility is also currently under construction in costa rica in september 2017 we announced plans to discontinue heart valve manufacturing operations in switzerland effective in early 2018 critical care products are manufactured primarily in our facilities located in puerto rico and the dominican republic 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our transcatheter heart valve therapy and surgical heart valve therapy products are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as manmade materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of sole source availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work closely with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining uncompromised quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered identified and approved for materials deemed critical to our products although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products intended to be implanted in humans we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing to our patients quality products and have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial design concept risk management and product specification and continues through the design of the product packaging and labeling and the manufacturing sales support and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into the products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including leansix sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are frequently inspected by the many regulators that oversee medical device manufacturing including the united states food and drug administration fda our european notified bodies and other regulatory entities the medical technology industry is highly regulated and our facilities and operations are designed to comply with all applicable quality systems standards including the international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a successful audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace promoting environmental excellence in our communities and complying with all relevant regulations and medical technology industry standards through our corporate and site level environmental health and safety functions we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution prevent injuries and maintain compliance with applicable regulations in order to measure performance we monitor and report on a number of metrics including regulated and nonregulated waste disposal energy usage water consumption air toxic emissions and injuries from our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria 

research and development 

we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring and we are dedicated to developing novel technologies to better enable clinicians to treat patients 

we invested 553 million  in research and development in 2017  442 million  in 2016  and 383 million  in 2015   161  149  and 154  of net sales respectively the majority of our research and development investment has been applied to new products in our existing product lines we have also dedicated a sizable portion of our research and development investment to developing additional advanced technologies designed to address unmet clinical needs within our areas of strategic focus a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products our investment in clinical studies also includes outcomes and costeffectiveness data for payers clinicians and healthcare systems 

in transcatheter heart valve therapy we are developing new products to further improve and streamline transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement procedures the edwards sapien 3 ultra system  features the sapien 3   ultra  valve with a heightened outer skirt and a delivery system that incorporates an onballoon design that is compatible with the lowprofile axela  sheath the centera  valve is designed to offer a low profile repositionable selfexpanding technology that is stable during valve deployment and delivered via a motorized handle 

we are also making significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases and other structural heart conditions we are developing potential products for mitral replacement and for mitral and tricuspid repair in january 2017 we completed the acquisition of valtech cardio ltd valtech which included the cardioband  technologies for mitral and tricuspid repair in addition we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing lessinvasive technologies to treat mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction 

our surgical heart valve therapy development programs include innovative platforms for patients who will continue to be treated surgically specifically more active patients with more complex combined procedures we are also making internal and external investments in the surgical treatment of mitral valve disease including the december 2017 acquisition of harpoon medical inc which is developing beatingheart mitral surgical repair technologies 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians this includes nextgeneration noninvasive and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems and a nextgeneration monitor platform we are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management including an algorithm that predicts the risk of a patient developing hypotension and a semiclosed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states and israel our experienced research and development staff is focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 3600 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products among others 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the fda european community notified bodies and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in may 2017 the european union implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the medical device regulation mdr the mdr becomes fully effective in 2020 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr will require recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments increasing evidentiary demands and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of health and human services hhs in the united states and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care legislation in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states as part of the affordable care act aca the law included provisions that among other things created programs to encourage a shift to valuebased care required all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposed increased taxes the law requires the medical technology industry to pay a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 through 2019 most recently in december 2017 public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act was enacted and includes several healthcare provisions including the repeal of the individual insurance mandate we do not anticipate that the repeal of the mandate will materially affect our business 

in 2015 the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 macra was signed into law incentivizing participation in alternative payment models that incentivize high value care the long term impact of the provisions in macra and the ensuing regulations remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve however we continue to believe that our portfolio is positioned well as the united states healthcare system shifts to valuebased care 

in late 2016 legislation was signed into law that among other things increases funding for medical research and eases the development and approval of breakthrough treatments known as the 21 st  century cures act the law also provides new funding for the national institutes of health and the fda although it will take some time to be fully implemented the 21 st  century cures act could help accelerate the discovery development and delivery of medical advancements to ensure more timely access to new treatments and cures for patients in need 

these laws or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 12200  employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states singapore the dominican republic and puerto rico other major concentrations of employees are located in europe and japan we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the sec additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in part 1 above 

business and operating risks 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items from third party vendors in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical technology companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the sec enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if we find that certain minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of our products directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing logistics or quality problems including as a result of natural disasters our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems or human error although closely managed disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment as well as during production line transfers and expansions as we expand into new markets we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing and warehousing facilities as well as those of our suppliers and logistics partners could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes volcanoes fires and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture store and distribute some of our products at other facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our assets or dispositions of business operations or for other reasons 

from time to time we identify operations and products that are underperforming or not a fit with our longer term business strategy we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development iprd assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired iprd either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which are larger better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical technology industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors in addition given the trend toward valuebased healthcare if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our products to healthcare providers and payors our competitive position could be adversely affected see  competition  under  business  included herein 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising 

results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general the strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

various laws including the affordable care act public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 and the 21st century cures act or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could impact medical procedure volumes reimbursement for our products and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products for more information about these laws as they relate to our business see the section entitled “ health care legislation ” in part i item 1 “ business ” 

in addition the 2017 tax act has resulted in significant changes to the us corporate income tax system these changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35 to 21 the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation the 2017 tax act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonus earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to us taxation as global intangible lowtaxed income these changes are effective beginning in 2018 

the 2017 tax act also includes the transition toll tax which is a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries previously untaxed foreign earnings the transition toll tax will be paid over an eightyear period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest our preliminary estimate of the transition toll tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of managements analysis related to certain matters such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 tax act changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of our tax returns us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 tax act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions the final determination of the transition toll tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available but no later than one year from the enactment of the 2017 tax act 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with anticorruption and antibribery laws our net sales originating outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 44  in 2017  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies principally in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect significant increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar could have a material effect on our revenues cost of sales and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical technology industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant selling research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations   

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

we may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical technologies our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing and assembly flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such problems could result in product liability medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to 

represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical technology industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions that bar the sale of our products or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the united states physician payment sunshine act and similar laws in other jurisdictions also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical technology industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical technology industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur in the future expenditures in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material

overview 

we are the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the worlds leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery and in intensive care we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas transcatheter heart valve therapy thvt surgical heart valve therapy shvt and critical care 

financial highlights 

our sales growth was led by our thvt products primarily due to increased sales of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve in the united states japan and europe our gross profit margin in 2017 was positively impacted by an improved product mix led by thvt products our gross profit margin in 2016 was negatively impacted relative to 2015 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations partially offset by an improved product mix led by thvt products the increase in our net income in 2017 was primarily driven by our increased sales and a gain from our successful litigation related to the theft of trade secrets partially offset by increased tax expenses due to the implementation of us tax law changes our net income in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased sales partially offset by an inprocess research and development iprd charge for technology we acquired for use in our transcatheter heart valve programs 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments in 2017  we invested 161  of our net sales in research and development the following is a summary of important developments during 2017  

 we are dedicated to generating robust clinical economic and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the current healthcare environment with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes

selling general and administrative sga expenses 

the increase in sga expenses in 2017  compared to 2016  was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and europe mainly to support the thvt program and higher personnelrelated costs the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2017  was due primarily to leverage from our higher thvt sales in the united states and japan 

the increase in sga expenses in 2016 compared to 2015  resulted primarily from higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and europe mainly to support our thvt program and higher personnelrelated costs these increases were partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax in the united states for 2016 through 2019 the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2016 was due primarily to higher sales in the united states and japan

change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities net 

the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in income of 99 million  net for the year ended december 31 2017 and expense of 11 million  and 02 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the contingent consideration liability related to one of our previous business acquisitions was reduced by 199 million during the three months ended september 30 2017  due to delays in product development which reduced the probability of milestone achievement this gain was partially offset by a 100 million expense in 2017  due to changes in the fair value of the liabilities resulting primarily from adjustments to discount rates and accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time for further information see note 10 to the  consolidated financial statements

interest expense 

interest expense was 232 million  192 million  and 172 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in interest expense for 2017 as compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a higher average debt balance partially offset by lower average interest rates the increase in interest expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates 

interest income 

interest income was 203 million  108 million  and 79 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in interest income for 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates 

  other expense net 

in millions 



the net foreign exchange losses relate primarily to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures 

the loss gain on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on our availableforsale money market and cost method investments 

in march 2016 we contributed 50 million to the edwards lifesciences foundation a relatedparty notforprofit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health and communityfocused charitable organizations the 

contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rates for 2017  2016  and 2015  were impacted as follows in millions 



  

on december 22 2017 public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 act was signed into law the 2017 act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 requires companies to pay a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred accelerates federal tax depreciation and creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings in future years 

on december 22 2017 staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 was issued to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 act in accordance with sab 118 we have estimated provisional amounts for 33 million of tax benefits in connection with the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities and 3274 million of current tax expense discussed below recorded in connection with the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries additionally as a result of a revenue procedure issued by the internal revenue service irs on february 13 2018 approximately 323 million of tax benefits associated with a tax reform related restructuring may need to be adjusted 

the changes included in the 2017 act are broad and complex the final transition impacts of the 2017 act may differ from the above estimate possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the 2017 act any further legislative or regulatory actions that arise because of the 2017 act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the 2017 act or any updates or changes to the estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete we did not identify items for which a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the 2017 act could not be determined as of december 31 2017 

as mentioned above the 2017 act requires a mandatory deemed repatriation of post1986 cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and profits the rate applied for the mandatory deemed repatriation varies depending on whether the earnings and profits are held in liquid or nonliquid assets a proportional deduction on the deemed repatriation results in a repatriation toll charge of effectively 155 for liquid assets and 8 for nonliquid assets at the election of the taxpayer the repatriation tax can be paid in installments over eight years we provisionally intend to elect to pay the repatriation tax in installments over eight years the deemed repatriation results in a provisional 3274 million  tax obligation which when offset by the correlative effects of uncertain tax positions of 300 million  results in a provisional net increase in tax expense of 2974 million  

factors impacting our effective tax rate in 2017 included the onetime impact of the mandatory taxation of previously unrepatriated earnings partially offset by the revaluation of taxrelated balance sheet items due to us tax rate changes in addition the effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the adoption of the new accounting standard for the tax benefit of employee sharedbased compensation see note 2 

uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the gross uncertain tax positions were 2256 million  and 2455 million  respectively we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 940 million  and 449 million  respectively from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amounts of 1316 million  and 2006 million  respectively if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions excluding interest penalties and foreign exchange is as follows in millions 



we recognize interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2017  we had accrued 74 million  net of 29 million  tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of december 31 2016  we had accrued 147 million  net of 108 million  tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax 

positions during 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized interest expense benefit net of tax benefit of 73 million  40 million  and 39 million  respectively in “ provision for income taxes ” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2017  all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 the irs has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years however the audits have been in suspense pending a final determination with respect to the application for an advance pricing agreement apa discussed below as a result of the partial agreement discussed below the irs will now be able to finalize their audits of the 2009 through 2011 tax years the irs began its examination of the 2014 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2016 

we had been pursuing an apa between the switzerland and united states governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a rollforward of the results to subsequent years during december 2017 the us and swiss competent authorities agreed on the terms of several of the transactions covered by the apa including a rollforward of some of the results through 2020 the remaining terms of transactions not covered by the final bilateral agreement will be reviewed by the irs as part of the traditional exam process for the tax years beyond 2011 these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements as the disputed amounts are material and the final outcome is uncertain we continue to believe our positions are supportable as a result of the bilateral agreement a reclassification of 737 million  was made from the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions to current taxes payable and a 152 million  tax benefit was recorded during the quarter 

during 2014 we filed with the irs a request for a prefiling agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received in may 2014 during the first quarter of 2015 the irs accepted our request into the prefiling agreement program the closing agreement for this matter was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2016 there remained a disputed issue and we were accepted into the fasttrack appeals process in july 2017 we met with the fasttrack appeals team in october 2017 and were unable to reach an agreement we intend to revert to the regular appeals process on this issue we made an advance payment of tax in december 2015 to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency 

we believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability however if the appeals process related to the prefiling agreement or transfer pricing matters is finalized in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months 

we have received tax incentives in certain nonus tax jurisdictions the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024 the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were 810 million   039  per diluted share 787 million   032  per diluted share and 604 million   025  per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

our dominican republic branch receives tax incentives including an exemption from paying dominican republic income taxes under a free trade zone law effective november 9 2012 the dominican republic enacted a law which among other tax provisions would apply a 10 withholding tax on dividends or branch remittances from a free trade zone company to its shareholders the dominican republic withholding tax provision was however contingent upon certain future events on october 5 2016 the dominican republic ministry of finance published a notification confirming that the 10 withholding tax on branch remittances would be due and payable by dominican republic free trade zone companies for dividends and remittances paid on or after october 5 2016 the impact of this withholding tax has been reflected in our income tax provision 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

on december 22 2017 public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 act was signed into law the legislation includes extensive changes to the international tax regime the 2017 act requires a deemed repatriation of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits the deemed repatriation resulted in a provisional 3274 million tax obligation the onetime transition tax liability will be payable in eight annual installments as outlined in the contractual obligations table below see note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the onetime transition tax 

as of december 31 2017  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 1423 million  and 12 billion  respectively prior to the 2017 act we asserted that the accumulated earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries would be permanently invested however as a result of the 2017 act substantially all of the 12 billion  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states will be available for use in the united states without incurring additional united states federal income taxes as we evaluate the impact of us tax legislation and the future cash needs of our global operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 

on december 1 2017 we acquired all the outstanding shares of harpoon medical inc for an aggregate cash purchase price of 1195 million  in addition we agreed to pay up to an additional 1500 million  in prespecified milestonedriven payments over the next 10 years for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

on november 26 2016 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire valtech for approximately 3400 million  subject to certain adjustments in stock and cash to be paid at closing with the potential for up to 3500 million  in additional prespecified milestonedriven payments over the next 10 years our acquisition of valtech closed on january 23 2017 and we issued an aggregate of approximately 28 million  shares of our common stock and paid approximately 862 million  in cash to holders of valtech securities prior to the close of the transaction valtech spun off its earlystage transseptal mitral valve replacement technology program we have an option to acquire that program and its associated intellectual property for approximately 2000 million  subject to certain adjustments plus an additional 500 million  if a certain european regulatory approval is obtained within 10 years of the acquisition closing date for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

on july 3 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire cardiaq for an aggregate cash purchase price of 3500 million subject to certain adjustments plus an additional 500 million if a certain european regulatory approval is obtained within 48 months of the acquisition closing date for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we have a fiveyear credit agreement credit agreement which provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement subject to agreement of the lenders by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2017  borrowings of 4384 million  were outstanding under the credit agreement and have been classified as longterm obligations in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 

in october 2013 we issued 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes due october 15 2018 we plan to issue new notes in 2018 to partially replace the maturing senior notes we expect that we will be able to pay the remaining principal and any accrued interest on the senior notes by one or a combination of the following refinancing such indebtedness using available cash resources or using amounts available under our credit agreement as of december 31 2017  the total carrying value of our unsecured senior notes was 5980 million  which has been classified as shortterm debt for further information on our debt see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2017  under the board authorized repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 76 million  shares at an aggregate cost of 7521 million  including 

amounts purchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements as of december 31 2017  we had remaining authority to purchase 13 billion  of our common stock for further information see note 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  

consolidated cash flows  for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015   

       

net cash flows provided by operating activities  of 10 billion  for 2017   increased   2963 million  from 2016  due primarily to improved operating performance and receipt of a litigation payment partially offset by higher working capital needs associated with growth in the business and the timing of tax payments 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 7044 million  for 2016   increased   1547 million  from 2015  due primarily to 1 improved operating performance and 2 lower supplier payments in 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by 1 the impact of excess tax benefits from stock plans primarily due to our increased stock price and 2 an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales primarily in the united states 

net cash used in investing activities  of 6472 million  in 2017  consisted primarily of net purchases of  investments of 2357 million  capital expenditures of 1681 million  a 1000 million  net cash payment associated with the acquisition of harpoon medical inc and an 819 million  net cash payment associated with the acquisition of valtech 

net cash used in investing activities of 2117 million  in 2016  consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 1761 million  and 413 million  for the acquisition of intangible assets 

net cash used in investing activities of 3161 million in 2015  consisted primarily of a 3201 million net payment associated with the acquisition of cardiaq and capital expenditures of 1027 million partially offset by net proceeds from investments of 1196 million 

net cash used in financing activities  of 4732 million  in 2017  consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 7633 million  partially offset by 1 net proceeds from the issuance of debt of 1763 million  and 2 proceeds from stock plans of 1138 million  

net cash used in financing activities of 2685 million  in 2016  consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 6623 million  partially offset by 1 net proceeds from the issuance of debt of 2221 million 2 proceeds from stock plans of 1033 million  and 3 the excess tax benefit from stock plans of 643 million  

net cash used in financing activities of 1586 million in 2015  consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 2801 million partially offset by 1 proceeds from stock plans of 872 million and 2 the excess tax benefit from stock plans of 413 million 

a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2017  were as follows in millions 



 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor at our distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

iprd acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the 

carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

due to the complexity of the new provisions of public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 act we are still evaluating whether we will recognize the us tax effects of global intangible lowtaxed income gilti as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises the period cost method or account for gilti in the measurement of deferred taxes the deferred method we have not yet elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the gilti provisions 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units performancebased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term for 

performancebased restricted stock units expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved which requires judgment stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of fixedrate debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us and foreign government and agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2017  we had 11 billion  of investments in fixedrate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 09 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixedrate debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2017  would have resulted in a 49 million to 97 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2017  we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2017  borrowings of 4384 million  were outstanding under the credit agreement to diversify our interest rate risk we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million the critical terms of the swaps matched the critical terms of 3000 million of the aggregate principal amount of the notes effectively converting that portion of the fixedrate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6month libor benchmark in december 2017 the interest rate swap was settled based on our december 31 2017  variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately 44 million most of which would be offset by increased returns on our shortterm investments the impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2017  a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 46 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts the total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2017  was 9798 million  a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 661 million any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations

proprietary technology 

patents trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 2700 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of 

transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products among others 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european community notified bodies and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of health and human services hhs in the united states and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017 but is scheduled to resume in 2018 the long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve this law or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could reduce 

medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for our products and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

in late 2016 legislation was signed into law that among other things increases funding for medical research and eases the development and approval of experimental treatments known as the 21 st  century cures act the law also provides new funding for the national institutes of health and the fda although it will take some time to be fully implemented the 21 st  century cures act could help accelerate the discovery development and delivery of medical advancements to ensure more timely access to new treatments and cures for patients in need 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 11100  employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states the dominican republic singapore and puerto rico other major concentrations of employees are located in europe and japan we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical device companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the sec enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if our suppliers cannot verify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing logistics or quality problems including as a result of natural disasters our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems or human error although closely managed disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment as well as during production line transfers and expansions as we expand into new markets we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing and warehousing facilities as well as those of our suppliers and logistics partners could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes volcanoes fires and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture store and distribute some of our products at other facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our assets or dispositions of business operations or for other reasons 

from time to time we identify operations and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable 

terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development iprd assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired iprd either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which are larger and have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors in addition given the trend toward valuebased healthcare if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our products to healthcare providers and payors our competitive position could be adversely affected see  competition  under  business  included herein 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general the strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017 but is scheduled to resume in 2018 the long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve this law or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects if they were to impact the demand for our products or pricing or result in cuts to or a restructuring of entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with anticorruption and antibribery laws our net sales originating outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 45  in 2016  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies principally in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect significant increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar could have a material effect on our revenues cost of sales and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant selling research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations   

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition the 2010 united states health 

care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

we may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing and assembly flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such problems could result in product liability medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection 

may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions that bar the sale of our products or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the united states physician payment sunshine act and similar laws in other jurisdictions also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material

overview 

we are the global leader in patientfocused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with the worlds leading clinicians and researchers and aggressively invest in research and development to transform care for structural heart disease and critically ill patients we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas transcatheter heart valve therapy thvt surgical heart valve therapy shvt and critical care 

financial highlights 

our sales growth was led by our thvt products which benefited from the launches of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve in the united states july 2015 europe january 2014 and japan march 2016 our gross profit margin in 2016 was negatively impacted relative to 2015 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations partially offset by an improved product mix led by thvt products our gross profit margin in 2015 benefited from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and an improved product mix led by thvt products our net income in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased sales partially offset by an inprocess research and development iprd charge for technology we acquired for use in our transcatheter heart valve programs net income in 2014 benefited from the receipt of 7500 million 4879 million net of tax for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments in 2016  we invested 150  of our net sales in research and development the following is a summary of important developments during 2016  



 we are dedicated to generating robust clinical economic and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the current healthcare environment with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes

selling general and administrative sga expenses 

the increase in sga expenses in 2016  resulted primarily from 1 higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and europe mainly to support our thvt program and 2 higher personnelrelated costs these increases were partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax in the united states which was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017 the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2016  was due primarily to higher sales in the united states and japan 

the decrease in sga expenses in 2015  resulted primarily from foreign currency which reduced expenses by 611 million due primarily to the weakening of the euro and the japanese yen against the united states dollar this decrease was partially offset by 1 higher sales and marketing expenses in europe the united states and japan mainly to support our thvt program and 2 higher personnelrelated costs the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2015  was due primarily to higher sales in the united states europe and japan 

research and development rd expenses

intellectual property litigation expenses income net 

in may 2014 we entered into an agreement with medtronic inc medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies and pursuant to the agreement we received an upfront payment from medtronic in the amount of 7500 million

special charges 

for information on special charges see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

interest expense was 192 million  172 million  and 172 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in interest expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates interest expense for 2015 remained flat compared to 2014 as the impact of higher average interest rates was offset by a lower average debt balance compared to 2014 

interest income 

interest income was 108 million  79 million  and 64 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in interest income for 2016 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates the increase in interest income for 2015 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates 

  other expense net 

in millions 



in march 2016 we contributed 50 million to the edwards lifesciences foundation a relatedparty notforprofit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health and communityfocused charitable organizations the 

contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment 

the foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations primarily in our intercompany receivable and payable balances partially offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended to hedge those exposures 

the gain loss on investments represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on our availableforsale and cost method investments during 2014 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 35 million related to one of our cost method investments 

in december 2014 we recorded a 40 million impairment charge related to a promissory note receivable because it was likely that we would be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement 

in march 2014 we recorded a 37 million insurance settlement gain related to inventory that was damaged in the fourth quarter of 2013 

in september 2014 we committed to purchase our draper utah facility under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement under the terms of the lease agreement we accrued 10 million for certain lease contract termination costs 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rates for 2016  2015  and 2014  were impacted as follows in millions 



uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the gross uncertain tax positions were 2455 million  and 2161 million  respectively we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 449 million  and 406 million  respectively from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amounts of 2006 million  and 1755 million  respectively if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions excluding interest penalties and foreign exchange is as follows in millions 



we recognize interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2016  we had accrued 147 million  net of 108 million  tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of december 31 2015  we had accrued 107 million  net of 76 million  tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions during 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized interest expense net of tax benefit of 40 million  39 million  and 23 million  respectively in “ provision for income taxes ” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2016  all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 the internal revenue service irs has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years however the audits are currently in suspense pending a final determination with respect to a pending application for an advance pricing agreement apa the irs began its examination of the 2014 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2016 

we have been pursuing an apa between the switzerland and united states governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a rollforward of the results to subsequent years these discussions remain ongoing as of december 31 2016 these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements as the disputed amounts are material and the final outcome is uncertain we continue to believe our positions are supportable 

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2016 we received notification of preliminary agreement on methodology between the respective competent authorities for the requested apas for 20152019 between the united states and japan switzerland and japan and singapore and japan these are expected to be formalized and executed during 2017 

during 2014 we filed with the irs a request for a prefiling agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 during the first quarter of 2015 the irs accepted the prefiling agreement into the prefiling agreement program the closing agreement for this matter was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2016 there remains a disputed issue and we expect to enter the fasttrack appeals process during 2017 we made an advance payment of tax in december 2015 solely to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency not to signify any potential agreement to a contrary position that may be taken by the irs 

management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability however if the apa andor the appeals process related to the prefiling agreement is finalized in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months 

the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 was higher than the rate for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily because of fluctuations in the relative contribution of our foreign operations and united states operations to worldwide pretax income offset by an increase in benefits from the federal and california research credits 

  

we have received tax incentives in certain nonus tax jurisdictions the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024 the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were 774 million   032  per diluted share 591 million   025  per diluted share and 683 million   031  per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

our dr branch receives tax incentives including an exemption from paying dr income taxes under a free trade zone law effective november 9 2012 dr enacted a law which among other tax provisions would apply a 10 withholding tax on dividends or branch remittances from a free trade zone company to its shareholders the dr withholding tax provision was however contingent upon certain future events on october 5 2016 the dr ministry of finance published a notification confirming that the 10 withholding tax on branch remittances would be due and payable by dr free trade zone companies for dividends and remittances paid on or after october 5 2016 as a result we expect this action will increase our effective tax rate in 2017 however the amount is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

as of december 31 2016  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 2141 million  and 10570 million  respectively we believe that cash held in the united states in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations are sufficient to fund our united states operating requirements for the next twelve months cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states the majority of which relates to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses and assets outside of the united states we consider making shortterm loans of cash held outside the united states to the united states from time to time based on facts and circumstances the permanent repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes the potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the united states and the respective foreign jurisdictions 

on november 26 2016 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire valtech for approximately 3400 million subject to certain adjustments in stock and cash to be paid at closing with the potential for up to 3500 million in additional prespecified milestonedriven payments over the next 10 years our acquisition of valtech closed on january 23 2017 and we issued an aggregate of approximately 28 million shares of our common stock and paid approximately 843 million in cash to holders of valtech securities prior to the close of the transaction valtech spun off its earlystage transseptal mitral valve replacement technology program we have an option to acquire that program and its associated intellectual property for approximately 2000 million subject to certain adjustments for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements

we periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2016  under the board authorized repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 72 million  shares at an aggregate cost of 6465 million  including amounts purchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements and as of december 31 2016  we had remaining authority to purchase 10310 million  of our common stock for further information see note 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  

consolidated cash flows  for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014   

       

net cash flows provided by operating activities  of 7044 million  for 2016   increased   1547 million  from 2015  due primarily to 1 improved operating performance and 2 lower supplier payments in 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by 1 the impact of excess tax benefits from stock plans primarily due to our increased stock price and 2 an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales primarily in the united states 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 5497 million  for 2015   decreased   4726 million  from 2014  due primarily to 1 the 7500 million upfront payment received from medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement and 2 a higher bonus payout in 2015 associated with 2014 performance these decreases were partially offset by 1 income tax payments of 2245 million made in 2014 related to the medtronic settlement 2 improved operating performance in 2015 and 3 the 500 million charitable contribution made in 2014 to the edwards lifesciences foundation

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and 

estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor at our distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

iprd acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units performancebased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term for performancebased restricted stock units expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved which requires judgment stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of fixedrate debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us government and agency securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2016  we had 8392 million  of investments in fixedrate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 11 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixedrate debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2016  would have resulted in a 48 million to 95 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2016  we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2016  borrowings of 2250 million  were outstanding under the credit agreement to diversify our interest rate risk we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million the critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of 3000 million of the aggregate principal amount of the notes effectively converting that portion of the fixedrate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6month libor benchmark based on our year end 2016  variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately 53 million most of which would be offset by increased returns on our shortterm investments the impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2016  a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 104 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts the total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2016  was 9497 million  a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 660 million any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts see note 2 and note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy at december 31 2016  all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of 

these entities we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any nonperformance by our current derivative counterparties 

concentrations of risk 

we invest excess cash in a variety of fixedrate debt securities and diversify the investments between financial institutions our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 

in the normal course of business we provide credit to customers in the health care industry perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2016  we had no customers that represented 10 or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable net 

investment risk 

we are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our investments as of december 31 2016  we had 8392 million  of investments in fixedrate debt securities of various companies of which 4982 million  were longterm in addition we had 339 million  of investments in equity instruments of public and private companies should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or credit capacity or fail to meet certain development milestones a decline in the investments values may occur resulting in unrealized or realized losses

we manufacture and sell a variety of peripheral vascular products used to treat endolumenal occlusive disease including the fogarty  line of embolectomy catheters which has been an industry standard for removing blood clots from peripheral blood vessels for more than 40 years 

competition 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance and reliability customer and clinical support and costeffectiveness are additional aspects of competition 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers 

  

we believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines in transcatheter heart valve therapy our primary competitors include medtronic plc boston scientific corporation st jude medical inc and symetis sa in surgical heart valve therapy our primary competitors include medtronic plc st jude medical inc and livanova plc in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems se a subsidiary of getinge ab and lidco group plc 

sales and marketing 

we have a number of broad product lines that require a sales and marketing strategy tailored to our customers in order to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to all of our customers worldwide our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable product brands in cardiovascular devices today to help broaden awareness of our products and technologies we conduct educational symposia and provide training to our customers 

because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of several direct sales forces as well as independent distributors we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2015  

where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals by national healthcare systems sales personnel work closely with the customers who purchase our products which primarily include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators and executives purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our products and where appropriate our corporate sales team actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a 

qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states and european national and regional buying groups 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales forces in 2015  51  of our sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states 

international in 2015  49  of our sales were derived internationally through our direct sales forces and independent distributors of the total international sales 58  were in europe 20  were in japan and 22  were in rest of world we sell our products in approximately 100 countries and our major international markets include australia canada china france germany italy japan spain and the united kingdom a majority of the sales and marketing approach outside the united states is direct sales although it varies depending on each countrys size and state of development 

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world our transcatheter heart valve therapy and surgical heart valve therapy products are manufactured primarily in the united states california and utah switzerland and singapore critical care products are manufactured primarily in our facilities located in puerto rico and the dominican republic 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our transcatheter heart valve therapy and surgical heart valve therapy products are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as manmade materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work closely with our suppliers to mitigate risk and seek continuity of supply while maintaining uncompromised quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered and identified although we do not typically pursue immediate regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products intended to be implanted in humans we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses and exceed the worldwide standard for sterile medical products 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing to our customers quality products that comply with the fda and other applicable regulations to meet this commitment we have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification processes and the manufacturing sales and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including leansix sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are inspected by the fda and are designed to comply with all applicable international quality systems standards including the international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace promoting environmental excellence in our communities and complying with all relevant regulations and medical device industry standards through our corporate and site level environmental health and safety functions we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution prevent injuries and maintain compliance in order to measure performance we monitor and report on a number of metrics including regulated and nonregulated waste disposal energy usage water consumption air toxic emissions and injuries from our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria

we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring and we are dedicated to developing novel technologies to better enable clinicians to treat patients 

we invested 3831 million  in research and development in 2015  3465 million  in 2014  and 3230 million  in 2013   154  149  and 158  of net sales respectively the majority of our research and development investment has been applied to strengthen our leadership position in transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies surgical tissue heart valve and heart valve repair therapies and hemodynamic monitoring products we have also dedicated a sizable portion of our research and development investment to developing additional advanced technologies designed to address unmet clinical needs within our areas of strategic focus a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and required postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products 

we are also making significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases and other structural heart conditions in 2015 we acquired cardiaq valve technologies cardiaq a developer of a transcatheter mitral valve replacement tmvr system we believe the combination of our own tmvr experience with the efforts of cardiaq will enable us to accelerate the development of a catheterbased therapy for patients with mitral valve disease who arent well served today in addition we are also developing lessinvasive technologies to address degenerative mitral regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction 

surgical heart valve therapy development programs include the edwards intuity elite valve system  a nextgeneration minimally invasive aortic heart valve system and the inspiris   resilia aortic valve which incorporates a novel tissue designed to provide patients with a durable tissue valve alternative to mechanical valves 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of nextgeneration noninvasive and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems including a nextgeneration hemodynamic monitor with wireless connectivity and an integrated semiclosed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states israel and the netherlands our experienced research and development staff is focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 2700 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european community notified bodies and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business is increasing 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

in may 2013 we received a warning letter from the denver district office of the fda resulting from an inspection of our facility in draper utah the warning letter relates specifically to the execution of our quality systems at the utah facility including design and process validation corrective and preventive actions finished device acceptance and packaging and indicated that we would not receive premarket approvals for devices reasonably related to those issues until the issues are resolved our utah facility manufactures devices such as cannulae and cardioplegia catheters heart valve repair rings and transcatheter heart valve delivery system components and accessories we are actively implementing the necessary actions to resolve these issues identified in the letter in june 2014 we were granted a variance from the fda for the sapien xt  delivery systems and components that are manufactured at the draper facility and have completed the items under our agreed upon action plan for addressing the safety and effectiveness of their intended use 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of health and human services hhs in the united states and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017 but is scheduled to resume in 2018 the long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve this law or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could reduce 

medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for our products and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 9800 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states the dominican republic singapore and puerto rico other major concentrations of employees are located in europe and japan we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the sec additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in item 1 business above 

business and operating risks 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from 

external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements we also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical device companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the sec enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if our suppliers cannot verify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems including as a result of natural disasters our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems software problems or human error although closely managed disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment as well as during production line transfers and expansions as we expand into new markets we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing facilities in california utah the dominican republic and puerto rico could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture some of our products at our other manufacturing facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this manufacturing transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our assets or business dispositions or for other reasons 

from time to time we identify operations and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products we may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development iprd assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired iprd either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which are larger and have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations 

or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general the strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax which increased our operating expenses was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017 but is scheduled to resume in 2018 the long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve this law or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects if they were to impact the demand for our products or pricing or result in cuts to or a restructuring of entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with anticorruption and antibribery laws our net sales originating outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 49  in 2015  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 12 

 

 

 

substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our revenues cost of sales and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant selling research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations   

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger and more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition the 2010 united states health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

legal compliance and regulatory risks 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information by cyberattack or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks loss damage destruction from system malfunction computer viruses loss of data privacy or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products require collection and disposal of products at the end of their 

lifecycle and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the united states physician payment sunshine act and similar laws in other jurisdictions also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to “mad cow disease” 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material

financial results 

the following is a summary of our financial performance dollars in millions except per share data 



our sales growth was led by our thv products which benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien xt  transcatheter heart valve in the united states june 2014 and the launches of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve in europe january 2014 and in the united states july 2015 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted in 2015 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which had a negative impact to gross profit in 2014 and an improved product mix led by thv products net income in 2014 benefited from the receipt of 7500 million 4879 million net of tax from medtronic inc medtronic for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative therapies and the value they bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments to strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities in 2015  we invested 154  of our net sales in research and development in a consolidating industry we believe our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline of meaningful new technologies will help us continue to be a preferred partner sustain our successes and build longterm value for our shareholders the following is a summary of important developments during 2015  

 we are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the current healthcare environment with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes

we incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of 70 million  96 million and 221 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively intellectual property litigation expenses decreased in 2015 and 2014 due to the may 2014 litigation settlement agreement with medtronic 

special charges 

for information on special charges see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

interest expense was 172 million  172 million  and 98 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively interest expense for 2015 remained flat compared to 2014 as the impact of higher average interest rates was offset by a lower average debt balance compared to 2014 the increase in interest expense for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance due to the issuance in october 2013 of 600 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes 

interest income 

interest income was 79 million  64 million  and 46 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in interest income for 2015 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates the increase in interest income for 2014 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances 

  other expense net 

in millions 



the foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations primarily in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances partially offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures 

the gain loss on investments represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on our availableforsale and cost method investments during 2014 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 35 million related to one of our cost method investments 

in december 2014 we recorded a 40 million impairment charge related to our promissory note receivable because it was likely that we would be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement 

in march 2014 we recorded a 37 million insurance settlement gain related to inventory that was damaged in the fourth quarter of 2013 

in september 2014 we committed to purchase our draper utah facility under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement under the terms of the lease agreement we accrued 10 million for certain lease contract termination costs 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rates for 2015  2014  and 2013  were impacted as follows in millions 



unrecognized tax benefits 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the gross unrecognized tax benefits were 2161 million  and 1923 million  respectively we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 406 million  and 343 million  respectively from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amounts of 1755 million  and 1580 million  respectively if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest penalties and foreign exchange is as follows in millions 



we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2015  we had accrued 107 million  net of 76 million  tax benefit of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and as of december 31 2014  we had accrued 68 million  net of 50 million  tax benefit of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits during 2015  2014  and 2013  we recognized interest expense net of tax benefit of 39 million  23 million  and 14 million  respectively in “ provision for income taxes ” on the consolidated statements of operations 

  

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2015  all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 the internal revenue service irs has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years however the audits are currently in suspense pending finalization of an advance pricing agreement apa and joint committee of taxation approval 

as noted above we entered into an apa process between the switzerland and united states governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters the transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements and the final outcome and timing of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain 

during 2014 we filed with the irs a request for a prefiling agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 during the first quarter of 2015 the irs accepted the prefiling agreement into the prefiling agreement program the finalization of the prefiling agreement is still pending however we made an advance payment of tax in december 2015 to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency only and not to signify any potential agreement to a contrary position that may be taken by the irs 

management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability however if the apa andor prefiling agreement is finalized in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months 

the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 was lower than the rate for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily because the rate for december 31 2014 included 1 2621 million of tax expense associated with a 7500 million litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 see note 3 to the “ consolidated financial statements ” and 2 48 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions 

  

the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 included 1 an 84 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and 2 313 million of tax expense associated with the 836 million litigation award received from medtronic in february 2013 see note 3 to the “ consolidated financial statements ” 

we have received tax incentives in puerto rico the dominican republic singapore and switzerland the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  by 025  031  and 022  respectively the puerto rico dominican republic and singapore grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028 2030 subject to review in 2015 and subsequent years and 2024 respectively the switzerland grant expired december 31 2015 and we are in the process of filing for renewal through 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

as of december 31 2015  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 2660 million and 9587 million respectively we believe that cash held in the united states in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations are sufficient to fund our united states operating requirements for the foreseeable future cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses and assets outside of the united states the majority of which relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested we consider making shortterm loans of cash held outside the united states to the united states from time to time based on facts and circumstances the permanent repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes the potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the united states and the respective foreign jurisdictions 

on july 3 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire cardiaq for an aggregate cash purchase price of 3500 million subject to certain adjustments plus an additional 500 million if a certain european regulatory approval is obtained within 48 months of the acquisition closing date we closed the purchase in august 2015 with available cash on hand in the united states for further information see note 7 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we have a fiveyear credit agreement credit agreement which provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies we may increase the amount available under the credit agreement subject to agreement of the lenders by up to an additional 2500 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2015  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in october 2013 we issued 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes due october 15 2018 as of december 31 2015  the total carrying value of our longterm debt was 5999 million  for further information on our longterm debt see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2015  we repurchased under the board authorized repurchase program a total of 25 million  shares at an aggregate cost of 2750 million  and as of december 31 2015  had remaining authority to purchase 6775 million  of our common stock in february 2016 edwards entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase 3250 million  of the companys common stock for further information see note 13 and note 21 to the  consolidated financial statements  

net cash flows provided by operating activities  of 5497 million  for 2015   decreased   4726 million  from 2014  due primarily to 1 the 7500 million upfront payment received in 2014 from medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement and 2 a higher bonus payout in 2015 associated with 2014 performance these decreases were partially offset by 1 income tax payments of 2245 million made in 2014 related to the medtronic settlement 2 improved operating performance in 2015 and 3 the 500 million charitable contribution made in 2014 to the edwards lifesciences foundation 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 10223 million  for 2014   increased   5496 million  from 2013  due primarily to 1 the 7500 million upfront payment received from medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement 2 a lower bonus payout in 2014 associated with 2013 performance and 3 improved operating performance these increases were partially offset by 1 income tax payments of 2245 million related to the medtronic settlement 2 the prior year receipt of 836 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent and 3 the 500 million charitable contribution made in 2014 to the edwards lifesciences foundation 

net cash used in investing activities  of 3161 million  in 2015  consisted primarily of a 3201 million net payment associated with the acquisition of cardiaq and capital expenditures of 1027 million  partially offset by net proceeds from  investments of 1196 million  

net cash used in investing activities of 6330 million  in 2014  consisted primarily of net purchases of  investments of 5274 million  and capital expenditures of 829 million

net cash used in financing activities of 1530 million  in 2014  consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 3009 million  partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1133 million  and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of 494 million  including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits 

a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  were as follows in millions 



 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor at our distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

iprd acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

contingent consideration 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors 

 33 

on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 

the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options servicebased restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units performancebased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term for performancebased restricted stock units expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved which requires judgment stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of fixedrate debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us government and agency securities municipal securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal securities the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise as of december 31 2015  we had 8580 million  of investments in fixedrate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 08 years taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixedrate debt securities a hypothetical 05 to 10 absolute increase in interest rates at december 31 2015  would have resulted in a 35 million to 69 million decrease in the fair value of these investments such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2015  we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2015  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement to diversify our interest rate risk we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million the critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of 3000 million of the aggregate principal amount of the notes effectively converting that portion of the fixedrate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6month libor benchmark based on our year end 2015  variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately 30 million most of which would be offset by increased returns on our shortterm investments the impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2015  a hypothetical 10 absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 160 million this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts the total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2015  was 10616 million a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 812 million and 837 million respectively any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts see note 2 and note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy at december 31 2015  all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any nonperformance by our current derivative counterparties 

concentrations of risk 

we invest excess cash in a variety of fixedrate debt securities and diversify the investments between financial institutions our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 

in the normal course of business we provide credit to customers in the health care industry perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2015  we had no customers that represent 10 or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable net 

we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain european countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries in addition we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries as of december 31 2015  our accounts receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts from customers in certain european countries where economic conditions have declined were 584 million 

investment risk 

we are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our investments as of december 31 2015  we had 8580 million  of investments in fixedrate debt securities of various companies of which 3517 million  were longterm in addition we had 282 million  of investments in equity instruments of public and private companies should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or credit capacity or fail to meet certain development milestones a decline in the investments values may occur resulting in unrealized or realized losses

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical device industry we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance and reliability customer and sales support and costeffectiveness are additional aspects of competition 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical device manufacturers 

we believe that we are a leading global competitor in each of our product lines in surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapies our primary competitors include medtronic inc st jude medical inc and sorin group in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems se a subsidiary of getinge ab and lidco group plc 

sales and marketing 

we have a number of broad product lines that require a sales and marketing strategy tailored to our customers in order to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to all of our customers worldwide our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable product brands in cardiovascular devices today to help broaden awareness of our products and technologies we conduct educational symposia and provide training to our customers 

because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of a direct sales force as well as independent distributors we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2014 

where we choose to market our products is also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals by national healthcare systems sales personnel work closely with the customers who purchase our products which primarily include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our products and where appropriate our sales force actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states national and regional buying groups 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales force in 2014 45 of our reported sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states 

international in 2014 55 of our reported sales were derived internationally through our direct sales force and independent distributors of the total international sales 58 were in europe 20 were in japan and 22 were in rest of world we sell our products in approximately 100 countries and our major international markets include australia brazil canada france germany italy japan the netherlands spain and the united kingdom a majority of the sales and marketing approach outside the united states is direct sales although it varies depending on each countrys size and state of development 

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world our transcatheter heart valve therapy and surgical heart valve therapy products are manufactured primarily in the united states california and utah switzerland and singapore critical care products are manufactured primarily in our facilities located in puerto rico and the dominican republic 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our transcatheter heart valve therapy and surgical heart valve therapy products are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as manmade materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work closely with our suppliers to mitigate risk and assure continuity of supply while maintaining uncompromised quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered and identified 

although we do not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse international health and regulatory authorities have given guidance identifying three factors contributing to the control of bse source of animals nature of tissue used and manufacturing process controls in the countries in which we sell our products we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products intended to be implanted in humans we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses and exceed the worldwide standard for sterile medical products 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing quality products that comply with united states food and drug administration fda and other applicable regulations to our customers to meet this commitment we have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification processes and the manufacturing sales and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including leansix sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are inspected by the fda and comply with all applicable international quality systems standards including the international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditors periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace promoting environmental excellence in our communities and complying with all relevant regulations and medical device industry standards through our corporate and site level environmental health and safety functions we establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution prevent injuries and maintain compliance in order to measure performance we monitor and report on a number of metrics including regulated and nonregulated waste disposal energy usage water consumption air toxic emissions and injuries from our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria 

research and development 

we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring and we are dedicated to developing novel technologies to better enable clinicians to treat patients 

we invested 3465 million in research and development in 2014 3230 million in 2013 and 2913 million in 2012 149 158 and 153 of net sales respectively the majority of our research and development investment has been applied to strengthen our leadership position in transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies surgical tissue heart valves heart valve repair therapies and hemodynamic monitoring products we have also dedicated a sizable portion of our research and development investment to developing advanced technologies designed to address unmet clinical needs within the area of structural heart disease a considerable portion of our research and development investment includes clinical trials and the collection of evidence that provide data for use in regulatory submissions and postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products 

we are investing substantially in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheterbased approaches in the area of transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr we are developing a repositionable selfexpanding transcatheter heart valve system the edwards centera transcatheter valve system in addition to nextgeneration balloonexpandable valves we are also making significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat mitral valve disease 

surgical heart valve therapy development programs include the edwards intuity elite valve system  a nextgeneration minimally invasive aortic heart valve system and resilia  an advanced tissue platform designed to improve tissue valve durability and ease of use 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of noninvasive and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems including continuous hemodynamic monitoring and other technologies that collect critical patient information to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions for larger patient populations 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states israel and the netherlands our experienced research and development staff is focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products 

proprietary technology 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 2500 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the us fda european community notified bodies and the japanese pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency to confirm compliance to the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business is increasing 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the import of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

in may 2013 we received a warning letter from the denver district office of the fda resulting from an inspection of our facility in draper utah the warning letter relates specifically to the execution of our quality systems at the utah facility including design and process validation corrective and preventive actions finished device acceptance and packaging and indicated that we would not receive premarket approvals for devices reasonably related to those issues until the issues are resolved our utah facility manufactures devices such as cannulae and cardioplegia catheters heart valve repair rings and transcatheter heart valve delivery system components and accessories we are actively implementing the necessary actions to resolve these issues identified in the letter in june 2014 we were granted a variance from the fda through june 15 2015 for the sapien xt delivery systems and components that are manufactured at the draper facility under the 

variance we are complying with an agreed upon action plan for the sapien xt delivery system that verifies the safety and effectiveness of its intended use 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product • the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider • federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 • the physician payments sunshine act which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of united states physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers including medical device pharmaceutical and biologics companies • the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and • the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute companies in the united states for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the united states failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

• product standards and specifications • packaging requirements • labeling requirements • product collection and disposal requirements • quality system requirements • import restrictions • tariffs • duties and • tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of health and human services hhs in the united states and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare hhs centers for medicare  medicaid services cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for medicare beneficiaries several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs including medicare and medicaid changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax increased our operating expenses because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to continued implementation the longterm impact on us is uncertain this law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for our products and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 9100 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states the dominican republic singapore and puerto rico other major concentrations of employees are located in europe and japan we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the sec enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if our suppliers cannot verify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems including as a result of natural disasters our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing facilities in california utah the dominican republic and puerto rico could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture some of our products at our other manufacturing facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this manufacturing transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our asset or business dispositions or for other reasons 

from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development iprd assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required 

to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired iprd either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general the strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices the excise tax increased our operating expenses because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to continued implementation the longterm impact on us is uncertain this law or any future legislation including deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects if they were to impact the demand for our products or pricing or result in cuts to or a restructuring of entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with anticorruption and antibribery laws our net sales originating outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 55 in 2014 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs • changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions such as the current financial uncertainties in europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions that may reduce the number of procedures that use our products • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges 13 

• potentially negative impact of tax laws including transfer pricing liabilities and tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash • difficulty in staffing and managing global operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers • local economic and financial conditions including sovereign defaults and decline in sovereign credit ratings affecting the collectability of receivables including receivables from sovereign entities • an outbreak of any lifethreatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant selling research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors 14 

• demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing of marketing training and other expenses related to the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with 

customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company information is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or 

injunctions or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the united states physician payment sunshine act and similar laws in other jurisdictions also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete 

these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition the 2010 united states health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the 

onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

overview 

we are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring enabling them to save and enhance lives we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas transcatheter heart valve therapy surgical heart valve therapy and critical care 

effective january 1 2014 we changed our method of accounting for certain intellectual property litigation expenses related to the defense and enforcement of our issued patents under the new method of accounting these legal costs are expensed in the period incurred previously these costs were capitalized and 

then amortized over the life of the related patent the financial results below reflect the change in accounting principle for further information see note 3 to the  consolidated financial statements  

financial results 

the following is a summary of our financial performance dollars in millions except per share data 



our sales growth was driven by our transcatheter heart valve therapy products which in europe benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve and in the united states benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve our gross profit margin was negatively impacted in 2014 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased incentive compensation due to our strong performance and higher manufacturing costs primarily for our operations in utah net income in 2014 and 2013 benefited from special items in 2014 we received 7500 million 4879 million net of tax from medtronic inc medtronic for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement and in 2013 we received from medtronic an 836 million 523 million net of tax litigation award 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property to strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities in 2014 we invested 149 of our net sales in research and development in a consolidating industry we believe our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline will continue to help us compete more effectively sustain our successes and build longterm value for our shareholders the following is a summary of important developments during 2014 

• early clinical outcomes in the edwards sapien 3 trial demonstrated outstanding safety including a low mortality and stroke rate • longerterm updates from the partner trial strengthened the evidence that patients treated with the sapien valve demonstrated a mortality benefit persistent symptom benefit and a statistically significant reduction in rehospitalizations compared with standard therapy • we received regulatory approval in europe for our sapien 3 valve • we received regulatory approval in the united states for our edwards sapien xt valve and we continued to evaluate the sapien 3 valve as part of the partner ii trial and • we received regulatory approval in europe for the edwards intuity elite valve system  and in the united states this valve platform has been studied as part of the transform trial threeyear clinical outcomes of the edwards intuity valve platform studied in the triton trial demonstrated improved cardiac and valvular performance as well as patient functional status 25 

we are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the new healthcare environment with the goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care 

results of operations 

net sales by major regions dollars in millions 



the 1077 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2014 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valve therapy which increased net sales by 851 million due primarily to 1 commercial sales of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve resulting from the product launch in june 2014 2 an increase in clinical sales of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve 3 royalties received under a license agreement with medtronic see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  and 4 the reversal of the sales reserve for estimated transcatheter heart valve therapy product returns upon delivery of nextgeneration valves the introduction of the nextgeneration valves was completed in 2014 these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve as customers converted to edwards sapien xt a reduction in net stocking orders as customers converted from direct sales to consignment and decreased clinical sales of edwards sapien xt  • critical care which increased net sales by 129 million due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products and • surgical heart valve therapy which increased net sales by 99 million driven primarily by sales of pericardial aortic tissue valves the 1697 million increase in international net sales in 2014 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valve therapy which increased net sales by 1524 million driven primarily by the launch of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve in europe and the ongoing launch of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in japan partially offset by lower sales of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in europe as customers converted to edwards sapien 3  • surgical heart valve therapy which increased net sales by 259 million driven primarily by sales of pericardial aortic tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves and • critical care which increased net sales by 161 million driven primarily by core hemodynamic products and enhanced surgical recovery products 26 

partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 230 million due to the weakening of various currencies against the united states dollar mainly the japanese yen partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar the 1275 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2013 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valve therapy which increased net sales by 1061 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve procedure volume increased following the fda action in october 2012 to expand the indicated patient population and access routes compared to the original 2011 approval the 184 million increase in international net sales in 2013 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valve therapy which increased net sales by 524 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve and • surgical heart valve products which increased net sales by 154 million driven primarily by sales of pericardial mitral tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 439 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities for more information see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

net sales by product group dollars in millions 



transcatheter heart valve therapy 

the 2359 million increase in net sales of transcatheter heart valve therapy products in 2014 was due primarily to 

• the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve driven primarily by the launch in europe and clinical sales in the united states and • the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve driven primarily by the launches in the united states and japan 27 

partially offset by 

• lower sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve primarily in the united states and the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in europe as customers converted to nextgeneration products the 1556 million increase in net sales of transcatheter heart valve therapy products in 2013 was due primarily to 

• the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve in the united states which increased net sales by 972 million • the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve which increased net sales by 618 million due primarily to an increase in international sales and • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which increased net sales by 52 million due primarily to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar partially offset by 

• a 141 million sales reserve for estimated transcatheter heart valve therapy product returns expected in 2014 upon introduction of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in europe and the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in the united states during the first quarter of 2014 we completed enrollment in the 500 patient cohort of the partner ii trial studying the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in high risk and inoperable patients in january 2014 we received fda approval to expand the partner ii trial to include a 1000 patient singlearm nonrandomized cohort to study the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in the treatment of intermediaterisk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis enrollment was completed in september 2014 at the end of 2014 we submitted our premarket approval application for sapien 3 in the united states 

in january 2014 we received ce mark for the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in europe in june 2014 we received fda approval for the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in the united states for the treatment of highrisk and inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis 

surgical heart valve therapy 

the 249 million increase in net sales of surgical heart valve therapy products in 2014 was due primarily to 

• surgical heart valve products which increased net sales by 364 million driven by sales in the united states and europe of pericardial aortic tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 105 million due to the weakening of various currencies against the united states dollar mainly the japanese yen partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar the 137 million increase in net sales of surgical heart valve therapy products in 2013 was due primarily to 

• surgical heart valve products which increased net sales by 301 million driven by sales of pericardial aortic and mitral tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves 28 

partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 202 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar in april 2014 we received ce mark for our advanced edwards intuity elite valve system this nextgeneration rapid deployment system facilitates smaller incisions in surgical aortic valve replacement procedures in the united states we completed enrollment of patients in our transform trial for edwards intuity elite and we continued enrolling patients in our commence clinical trial which is studying our nextgeneration glx advanced tissue platform applied to the magna ease aortic surgical valve and the magna mitral ease valve 

critical care 

the 166 million increase in net sales of critical care products in 2014 was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products and core hemodynamic products outside the united states partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 120 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 

the 234 million decrease in net sales of critical care products in 2013 was due primarily to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 289 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 

in june 2014 we received fda clearance for the clearsight system a noninvasive monitor that provides clinicians access to blood volume and blood flow information for patients at moderate or high risk of postsurgical complications in whom invasive monitoring would not be used the clearsight system is part of our enhanced surgical recovery product portfolio in september 2014 due to a strategic shift of our investment initiatives we decided to discontinue our automated glucose monitoring program 

gross profit 



the 16 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2014 was driven by 

• a 07 percentage point decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts • a 07 percentage point decrease due to higher performancebased incentive compensation and • higher manufacturing costs primarily for our operations in utah partially offset by 

• a 08 percentage point increase due to an improved product mix in the united states driven by transcatheter heart valve therapy products the 05 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was driven by 

• a 10 percentage point increase due to an improved product mix in the united states driven by transcatheter heart valve therapy products and • a 05 percentage point increase in international markets due to a more profitable product mix primarily higher sales of transcatheter heart valve therapy products 29 

partially offset by 

• a 13 percentage point decrease due primarily to higher manufacturing costs due to capacity expansion in preparation for multiple transcatheter heart valve therapy product introductions selling general and administrative sga expenses dollars in millions

research and development expenses dollars in millions 



the increase in research and development expenses in 2014 was due primarily to new aortic and mitral transcatheter heart valve therapy product development efforts additional investments in clinical studies in the surgical heart valve therapy program and higher performancebased incentive compensation the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to higher net sales 

the increase in research and development expenses in 2013 was due primarily to additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in the transcatheter heart valve therapy program 

intellectual property litigation income expense net 

in may 2014 we entered into an agreement with medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves pursuant to the agreement we received an upfront payment from medtronic in the amount of 7500 million for further information see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

in february 2013 we received 836 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent including accrued interest

special charges 

special charges were 707 million 163 million and 160 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively for additional details see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense was 172 million 98 million and 44 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in interest expense for 2014 and 2013 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year due to the issuance in october 2013 of 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes 

interest income 

interest income was 64 million 46 million and 48 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in interest income for 2014 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances the decrease in interest income for 2013 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances 

other expense net in millions 



in december 2014 we recorded a 40 million impairment charge related to our promissory note receivable because it was likely that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement 

the loss on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on our availableforsale and cost method investments during 2014 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 35 million related to one of our cost method investments 

in march 2014 we recorded a 37 million insurance settlement gain related to inventory that was damaged in the fourth quarter of 2013 

the foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures 

in september 2014 we committed to purchase our draper utah facility for 170 million under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement under the terms of the lease agreement we paid 10 million in december 2014 for certain lease contract termination costs 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rates for 2014 2013 and 2012 were impacted as follows in millions 



reserve for uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was 1923 million and 1277 million respectively we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 343 million and 309 million respectively from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amounts of 1580 million and 968 million respectively if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest penalties and foreign exchange is as follows in millions 



we recognize interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2014 we had accrued 68 million net of 50 million tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of december 31 2013 we had accrued 45 million net of 33 million tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized interest expense net of tax benefit of 23 million 14 million and 10 million respectively in  provision for income taxes  on the consolidated statements of operations 

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to 

challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions 

at december 31 2014 all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008 during the third quarter of 2013 the internal revenue service irs completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years the case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an advance pricing agreement apa and joint committee of taxation approval the irs began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013 

we have also entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain 

during 2014 we also filed with the irs a request for a prefiling agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes we cannot reasonably estimate what if any changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a longterm liability however if the apa andor prefiling agreement is finalized in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months 

the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 included 1 2621 million of tax expense associated with a 7500 million litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  and 2 48 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions 

the federal research credit expired on december 31 2011 and was reinstated on january 2 2013 as a result the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 included 1 an 84 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and 2 313 million of tax expense associated with the 836 million litigation award received from medtronic in february 2013 see note 4 to the  consolidated financial statements  

we have received tax incentives in puerto rico the dominican republic singapore and switzerland the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 by 063 044 and 039 respectively the puerto rico dominican republic singapore and switzerland grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028 2030 subject to review beginning in 2015 2024 and 2015 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to 

time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions we believe that we have the financial flexibility to attract longterm capital to fund shortterm and longterm growth objectives however no assurances can be given that such longterm capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 

we believe that cash held in the united states in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations are sufficient to fund our united states operating requirements for the next twelve months cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses outside of the united states although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to temporary intercompany loans into the united states as of december 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in the united states and outside the united states were 6517 million and 7871 million respectively the majority of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes the potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the united states and the respective foreign jurisdictions 

we have a fiveyear credit agreement the credit agreement which provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in october 2013 we issued 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes due october 15 2018 for further information on our longterm debt see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock during 2014 we repurchased a total of 44 million shares at an aggregate cost of 3000 million and as of december 31 2014 had remaining authority to purchase 9525 million of our common stock for further information see note 13 to the  consolidated financial statements  

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 10223 million for 2014 increased 5496 million from 2013 due primarily to 1 the 7500 million upfront payment received from medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement 2 a lower bonus payout in 2014 associated with 2013 bonuses and 3 improved operating performance these increases were partially offset by 1 income tax payments of 2245 million related to the medtronic settlement 2 the prior year receipt of 836 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent and 3 the 500 million charitable contribution to the edwards lifesciences foundation in 2014 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 4727 million for 2013 increased 1106 million from 2012 due primarily to 1 the receipt of 836 million from medtronic inc in satisfaction of the april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the us andersen transcatheter heart valve patent 2 increased collection of accounts receivable and 3 improved operating performance these increases were partially offset by 1 a 227 million increase in inventory purchases to support future product launches and 2 a 170 million impact from excess tax benefits from stock plans primarily as a result of the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the united states in 2011 and 2012 

net cash used in investing activities of 6330 million in 2014 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of 5274 million and capital expenditures of 829 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 4127 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of 3009 million and capital expenditures of 1090 million 

net cash used in financing activities of 1530 million in 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of 3009 million partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of 1133 million and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of 494 million including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits 

net cash provided by financing activities of 349 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net proceeds from debt of 4096 million the excess tax benefit from stock plans of 735 million including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits and proceeds from stock plans of 455 million partially offset by repurchases of common stock of 4969 million 

a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2014 were as follows in millions 



a the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31 2014 was 493 million this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets therefore we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table see note 12 to the  consolidated financial statements  for further information b capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and it is not certain if andor when these payments will be made c as of december 31 2014 the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was 2041 million we have entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table we acquire assets still in development enter into research and development arrangements and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone royalty or other future payments to thirdparties 

contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment we have included those payments in the table above however we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial we estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately 1100 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations were met 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor at our distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to iprd acquired in business combinations are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 16 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements while earning a reasonable market return we invest in a variety of fixedrate debt securities primarily time deposits commercial paper us government and agency securities municipal securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities and municipal securities our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise which could result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity which we currently do not anticipate as of december 31 2014 we had 9995 million of investments in fixedrate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 05 years a hypothetical 25 basis point increase in interest rates at december 31 2014 would have resulted in a 12 million decrease in the fair value of these investments 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2014 we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement to diversify our interest rate risk we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million the critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of 3000 million of the debt issuance effectively converting that portion of the fixedrate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6month libor benchmark based on our year end 2014 and 2013 variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2014 and 2013 a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 52 million and 60 million respectively this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 9 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts we do not hedge our exposure related to our net investments in our nonunited states subsidiaries the total notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2014 and 2013 were 7704 million and 8055 million respectively a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 463 million and 511 million respectively any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts see note 2 and note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy at december 31 2014 all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any nonperformance by our current derivative counterparties 

concentrations of risk 

we invest excess cash in a variety of fixedrate debt securities and diversify the investments between financial institutions 

in the normal course of business we provide credit to customers in the health care industry perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2014 we had no customers that represent 10 or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable net 

we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain european countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries in addition we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries as of december 31 2014 our accounts receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts from customers in certain european countries were 697 million 

investment risk 

we are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of our investments as of december 31 2014 we had 8394 million of investments in fixedrate debt securities designated as heldtomaturity of which 723 million were longterm and 1601 million of investments in fixedrate debt securities designated as availableforsale of which 1422 million were longterm as of december 31 2014 we had recorded unrealized losses of 04 million on the availableforsale investments in  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax should we choose or be forced to sell an investment that has declined in market value prior to its maturity we may be required to realize losses in principal in addition we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies as of december 31 2014 we had 264 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 04 million on these investments in  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary

the following discussion summarizes the main areas of products and technologies we offer to treat advanced cardiovascular disease these are categorized into three main areas surgical heart valve therapy transcatheter heart valves and critical care for more information on net sales from these three main areas see net sales by product group  under  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

surgical heart valve therapy 

we are the global leader in heart valve therapy and the worlds leading manufacturer of heart valves and repair products which are used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve we produce pericardial valves from biologically inert animal tissue sewn onto proprietary wireform stents 

the core of our surgical tissue heart valve product line is the carpentieredwards perimount pericardial valve including the line of perimount magna ease valves the newest generation pericardial valves for aortic and mitral replacement with their proven durability and performance perimount valves are the most widely prescribed tissue heart valves in the world in addition to its replacement valves we pioneered and are the worldwide leader in heart valve repair therapies including annuloplasty rings and systems we have also developed the edwards intuity valve system  a minimally invasive aortic heart valve system designed to enable a faster procedure shorter patient time on cardiopulmonary bypass and a smaller incision 

cardiac surgeons and their patients increasingly are seeking less invasive approaches to aortic or mitral valve surgery which offer a number of potential benefits including smaller incisions less blood loss quicker recoveries and less scarring edwards lifesciences thruport systems enable minimal incision valve surgery where surgeons perform intricate procedures through small incisions and allow surgeons to tailor procedures based on their preferred surgical approach we are also a global leader in protection cannulae which are used during cardiac surgery in venous drainage aortic perfusion venting and cardioplegia delivery 

sales of our surgical tissue heart valve products represented approximately 34 36 and 40 of our net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

transcatheter heart valves 

we have leveraged the knowledge and experience from our surgical heart valve portfolio to optimize transcatheter heart valve replacement technology designed for the nonsurgical replacement of heart valves 

the edwards sapien edwards sapien xt and edwards sapien 3 transcatheter aortic heart valves are used to treat heart valve disease using catheterbased approaches for certain patients deemed at risk for traditional openheart surgery delivered while the heart is beating these valves can enable patients to experience a better quality of life sooner than patients receiving alternative therapies we began offering our transcatheter heart valves to patients commercially in europe in 2007 in the united states in 2011 and in japan in 2013 as of december 31 2013 our transcatheter aortic heart valves were available for sale in over 60 countries sales of our transcatheter heart valves represented approximately 35 29 and 20 of our net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

critical care 

we are a world leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients heart function in surgical and intensive care settings hemodynamic monitoring enables a clinician to balance the oxygen supply and demand of a critically ill patient and plays an important role in ensuring tissue and organ perfusion and ultimately patient outcomes and survival 

our hemodynamic monitoring technologies are used before during and after openheart major vascular major abdominal neurological and orthopedic surgical procedures as well as for acutely ill patients with conditions such as sepsis acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure we manufacture the flotrac continuous cardiac output monitoring system a minimally invasive cardiac monitoring technology for goaldirected hemodynamic optimization our hemodynamic monitoring product line also includes the swanganz line of pulmonary artery catheters and the presep continuous venous oximetry catheter for measuring central venous oxygen saturation our volumeview sensorcatheter set measures a critically ill patients volumetric hemodynamic parameters while the ev1000 clinical monitoring platform displays a patients physiologic status and integrates many of our sensors and catheters into one intuitive platform 

in 2012 we extended our critical care product offering with the acquisition of a noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring product line we plan to integrate this product clearsight  into our ev1000 clinical platform in 2014 

we are also the global leader in disposable pressure monitoring devices and innovative closed blood sampling systems to help protect both patients and clinicians from the risk of infection sales of our hemodynamic monitoring devices represented approximately 23 26 and 29 of our net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we manufacture and sell a variety of peripheral vascular products used to treat endolumenal occlusive disease including balloontipped catheterbased embolectomy products surgical clips and clamps our fogarty line of embolectomy catheters has been an industry standard for removing blood clots from peripheral blood vessels for more than 40 years 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies including divisions of companies much larger than us and smaller companies that compete in specific product lines or certain geographies furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical device industry we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness 

the cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving 

patient needs the ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical device manufacturers 

we believe that we are globally one of the leading competitors in each of our major product lines in surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapies our primary competitors include st jude medical inc medtronic inc and sorin group in critical care we compete primarily with a variety of companies in specific product lines including icu medical inc pulsion medical systems ag and lidco group plc 

sales and marketing 

we have a number of broad product lines that require a sales and marketing strategy tailored to our customers in order to deliver highquality costeffective products and technologies to all of our customers worldwide our portfolio includes some of the most recognizable product brands in cardiovascular devices today to help broaden awareness of our products and technologies we conduct educational symposia and provide training to our customers 

because of the diverse global needs of the population that we serve our distribution system consists of a direct sales force as well as independent distributors we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales in 2013 

sales personnel work closely with the customers who purchase our products which primarily include physicians nurses and other clinical personnel but can also include decision makers such as material managers biomedical staff hospital administrators purchasing managers and ministries of health also for certain of our products and where appropriate our sales force actively pursues approval of edwards lifesciences as a qualified supplier for hospital group purchasing organizations gpos that negotiate contracts with suppliers of medical products additionally we have contracts with a number of united states national and regional buying groups 

united states in the united states we sell substantially all of our products through our direct sales force in 2013 46 of our reported sales were derived from sales to customers in the united states 

international in 2013 54 of our reported sales were derived internationally through our direct sales force and independent distributors of the total international sales 56 were in europe 22 were in japan and 22 were in rest of world we sell our products in approximately 100 countries and our major international markets include australia brazil canada france germany italy japan the netherlands spain and the united kingdom a majority of the sales and marketing approach outside the united states is direct sales although it varies depending on each countrys size and state of development the international markets in which we choose to market our products are also influenced by the existence of or potential for adequate reimbursement to hospitals by national healthcare systems 

raw materials and manufacturing 

we operate manufacturing facilities in various geographies around the world our surgical heart valve therapy and transcatheter heart valve products are manufactured in california and utah in the united states switzerland and singapore critical care products are manufactured primarily in our facilities located in puerto rico and the dominican republic 

we use a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials in the design development and manufacture of our products our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals most of our surgical heart valve therapy and transcatheter heart valve products are manufactured from natural tissues harvested from animal tissue as well as manmade materials we purchase certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers in addition we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of 

quality assurance sole source availability cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 

we work closely with our suppliers to mitigate risk and assure continuity of supply while maintaining uncompromised quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered and identified although we do not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process 

we follow rigorous sourcing and manufacturing procedures intended to safeguard humans from potential risks associated with diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse international health and regulatory authorities have given guidance identifying three factors contributing to the control of bse source of animals nature of tissue used and manufacturing process controls in the countries in which we sell our products we comply with all current global guidelines regarding risks for products intended to be implanted in humans we obtain bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products only from sources within the united states and australia where strong control measures and surveillance programs exist in addition bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valve products is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility our manufacturing and sterilization processes are designed to render tissue biologically safe from all known infectious agents and viruses and exceed the worldwide standard for sterile medical products 

quality assurance 

we are committed to providing quality products that comply with united states food and drug administration fda and other applicable regulations to our customers to meet this commitment we have implemented modern quality systems and concepts throughout the organization the quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification processes and the manufacturing sales and servicing of the product the quality system is intended to design quality into products and utilizes continuous improvement concepts including lean six sigma principles throughout the product lifecycle 

our operations are certified under fda and all applicable international quality systems standards such as international organization for standardization iso 13485 these standards require among other items quality system controls that are applied to product design component material suppliers and manufacturing operations these regulatory approvals and iso certifications can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system has been conducted by regulatory or independent outside auditor periodic reexamination by an independent outside auditor is required to maintain these certifications 

environmental health and safety 

we are committed to a safe and healthy workplace and the promotion of environmental excellence in our own communities and worldwide through our environmental health and safety function we facilitate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and monitor performance against these requirements at all levels of our organization in order to measure performance we monitor a number of metrics which include the generation of both regulated and nonregulated waste emissions of air toxics energy usage and lost time incidents in our production activities each of our manufacturing sites is evaluated regularly with respect to a broad range of environmental health and safety criteria 

research and development 

we are engaged in ongoing research and development to deliver clinically advanced new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our current leading products and to expand the applications of our products as appropriate we focus on opportunities within specific areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring and we are dedicated to developing novel technologies to better enable clinicians to treat patients who suffer from the disease 

we invested 3230 million in research and development in 2013 2913 million in 2012 and 2463 million in 2011 158 153 and 147 of net sales respectively a significant portion of our research and development investment has been applied to extend and defend our leadership position in transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies surgical tissue heart valves heart valve repair therapies and hemodynamic monitoring products additionally we dedicate a sizable portion of our research and development investment to developing advanced technologies designed to address unmet clinical needs within the area of structural heart disease 

we are investing substantially in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheterbased approaches in the area of transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr we are developing a repositionable selfexpanding transcatheter heart valve system the edwards centera transcatheter valve system in addition to nextgeneration balloonexpandable valves we are also making significant investment in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat mitral valve disease 

surgical heart valve therapy development programs include the edwards intuity elite valve system  a nextgeneration minimally invasive aortic heart valve system and glx  an advanced tissue platform designed to improve tissue valve durability and ease of use we also plan to broaden our offering of minimally invasive surgical technologies and other products to complement our surgical heart valve therapy products 

in our critical care product line we are pursuing the development of noninvasive and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems including continuous hemodynamic monitoring and automated glucose monitoring and other technologies that collect critical patient information to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions for larger patient populations 

our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the united states israel and the netherlands our experienced research and development staff is focused on product design and development quality clinical research and regulatory compliance to pursue primary research efforts we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products these studies include clinical trials which provide data for use in regulatory submissions and postmarket approval studies involving applications of our products 

proprietary technology 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 

we own more than 2500 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications we also have licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings and systems we also own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition we own or have rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products 

we are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for crosslicensing rights andor royalty payments we have also licensed certain patent rights to others 

we monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned andor licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents 

we own certain united states registered trademarks used in our business many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

our products and technologies are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign government agencies including the fda and various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products and technologies we are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business is increasing 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and recordkeeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products a number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance 

in may 2013 we received a warning letter from the denver district office of the fda resulting from an inspection of our facility in draper utah the warning letter relates specifically to the execution of our quality systems within the cardiac surgery systems business including design and process validation corrective and preventive actions finished device acceptance and packaging and indicated that we would not receive premarket approvals for devices reasonably related to those issues until the issues are resolved our utah facility manufactures devices for the cardiac surgery systems business such as cannulae and cardioplegia catheters and also makes devices for our other businesses including heart valve repair rings and transcatheter heart valve delivery system components and accessories we are in the process of implementing the necessary actions to respond to the specific issues addressed in the letter and remain committed to thoroughly resolving those issues 

we are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product • the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider • federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 • the physician payments sunshine act which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of united states physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers including medical device pharmaceutical and biologics companies • the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and • the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute companies in the united states for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the united states failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in our compliance efforts we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which we operate in addition we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation of medical devices into japan is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

• product standards and specifications • packaging requirements • labeling requirements • product collection and disposal requirements • quality system requirements • import restrictions • tariffs • duties and • tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies 

the delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs including medicare and medicaid changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility 

hospital reimbursement in the united states for tavr procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes cms has issued a national coverage determination ncd that provides nationwide medicare coverage of tavr for patients who either fall within fdaapproved criteria or are part of an approved clinical study in the united states physician codes and payment rates have also been established for tavr procedures 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation 

partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax increased our operating expenses because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on us is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for our products and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 

seasonality 

our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 8600 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states the dominican republic puerto rico and singapore other major concentrations of employees are located in europe and japan we emphasize competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employ a rigorous talent management system none of our north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved 

indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the 

sec enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if our suppliers cannot certify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition our manufacturing facilities in california utah the dominican republic and puerto rico could be materially damaged by earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances while we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture some of our products at our other manufacturing facilities the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this manufacturing transition is complete and operates without significant disruption 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our asset or business dispositions or for other reasons 

from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available 

for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development iprd assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired iprd either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general the strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax increased our operating expenses because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on us is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for our products and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products for example the budget control act of 2011 which provided an increase to the united states debt limit imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade this measure and other such deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects if they were to result in cuts to or a restructuring of entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

we do business with governments outside the united states a number of these countries including certain european countries have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries in addition we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act as well as with the united kingdoms bribery act and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions our net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 54 in 2013 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs • changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions such as the current financial uncertainties in europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges • potentially negative impact of tax laws including transfer pricing liabilities and tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash • difficulty in staffing and managing global operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers • local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables including receivables from sovereign entities • an outbreak of any lifethreatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing of marketing training and other expenses related to the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures the quarterly and fullyear financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance including those described above our financial guidance may vary from actual results if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year the price of our common stock could decline 

we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive workforce our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company data could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber 

attacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product 

based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution in addition the fda may withhold or delay premarket approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse affect on our business 

the physician payment sunshine act also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties we will be required to report such aggregate data by march 31 2014 and detailed data by may 30 2014 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing anticorruption and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition the 2010 united states health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong 

relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

overview 

we are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring driven by a passion to help patients we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring enabling them to save and enhance lives we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions united states europe japan and rest of world our products are categorized into the following main areas surgical heart valve therapy transcatheter heart valves and critical care 

financial results 

the following is a summary of our financial performance dollars in millions except per share data 



our sales growth was driven by our transcatheter heart valves product group due to strong growth in europe and starting in 2013 the united states our gross profit margin has benefited from a more profitable product mix led by the increased transcatheter heart valve sales but has been tempered by higher manufacturing costs as we have prepared for new product launches net income in 2013 also benefited from the 523 million litigation award net of tax received from medtronic inc we continue to significantly invest in research and development to extend and defend our leadership position 

healthcare environment opportunities and challenges 

the medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care and we are committed to defending our intellectual property to strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities in 2013 we invested 158 percent of our net sales in research and development in the coming year we expect increased competition with our transcatheter heart valves as our competitors begin introducing products in the united states and europe the following is a summary of important transcatheter heart valve developments during 2013 

• clinical evidence in the partner ii trial demonstrated similar outcomes between the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve and the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in inoperable patients a positive step toward the approval of sapien xt and its lower profile delivery system • longerterm updates from the partner trial strengthened the evidence that the sapien valve is a safe and lessinvasive alternative for patients who need valve replacement but are at high surgical risk and • we received regulatory approval and reimbursement for our edwards sapien xt valve in japan and in january 2014 regulatory approval in europe to launch our sapien 3 valve united states studies of the sapien 3 valve were initiated in august 2013 we are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients clinicians and payors in the new healthcare environment with a goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care 

results of operations 

net sales by major regions dollars in millions 



the 1275 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2013 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valves which increased net sales by 1061 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve procedure volume increased following the fda action in october 2012 to expand the indicated patient population and access routes compared to the original 2011 approval the 184 million increase in international net sales in 2013 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valves which increased net sales by 524 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve and • surgical heart valve products which increased net sales by 154 million driven primarily by sales of the carpentieredwards perimount magna mitral ease and edwards intuity elite valves partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 439 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar the 2065 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2012 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valves which increased net sales by 2035 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 the 145 million increase in international net sales in 2012 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valves which increased net sales by 359 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve and • surgical heart valve therapy products which increased net sales by 195 million driven primarily by sales of the carpentieredwards perimount magna aortic ease valve partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 424 million due primarily to the weakening of the euro against the united states dollar the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities for more information see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

net sales by product group dollars in millions 



surgical heart valve therapy 

the 137 million increase in net sales of surgical heart valve therapy products in 2013 was due primarily to 

• surgical heart valve products which increased net sales by 301 million driven by sales of the carpentieredwards perimount magna aortic ease carpentieredwards perimount magna mitral ease and edwards intuity elite valves and • cardiac surgery systems which increased net sales by 49 million driven by sales of specialty cannula products partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 202 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar the 31 million increase in net sales of surgical heart valve therapy products in 2012 was due primarily to 

• surgical heart valve products which increased net sales by 125 million driven by sales of the carpentieredwards perimount magna aortic ease valve and • cardiac surgery systems which increased net sales by 60 million driven by specialty cannula products and minimally invasive surgical products partially offset by 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 153 million due primarily to the weakening of the euro against the united states dollar at the end of the first quarter of 2013 we received approval to sell our carpentieredwards perimount magna ease valve in china in the united states we received approval from the fda to include edwards intuity elite our nextgeneration minimally invasive aortic valve surgery system in our ongoing transform trial a clinical trial designed to support fda approval for the product we continued to enroll patients in our commence clinical trial which is studying our nextgeneration glx tissue treatment platform applied to the magna ease aortic surgical valve and the magna mitral ease valve 

transcatheter heart valves 

the 1556 million increase in net sales of transcatheter heart valves in 2013 was due primarily to

• the voluntary recalls in the second quarter of 2012 of certain of our heart valves and critical care catheters and manufacturing inefficiencies selling general and administrative sga expenses dollars in millions 



the 403 million increase in sga expenses in 2013 was due primarily to 1 higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and japan mainly to support the transcatheter heart valve program and 2 the 23 excise tax or 158 million on united states sales of most medical devices which became effective in 2013 these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency which reduced expenses by 124 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was due primarily to decreased sga expenses in europe as a percentage of net sales

interest expense 

interest expense was 98 million 44 million and 31 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 54 million increase in interest expense for 2013 resulted primarily from a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year and higher average interest rates due to the issuance in october 2013 of 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes the 13 million increase in interest expense for 2012 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year

reserve for uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was 1277 million and 1136 million respectively we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by 309 million and 261 million respectively from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amounts of 968 million and 875 million respectively if not required would favorably affect our effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest penalties and foreign exchange is as follows in millions 



we recognize interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2013 we had accrued 45 million net of 33 million tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of december 31 2012 we had accrued 31 million net of 21 million tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions during 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized interest expense net of tax benefit of 14 million 10 million and 04 million respectively in  provision for income taxes  on the consolidated statements of operations 

we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore we may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise our right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions

liquidity and capital resources 

our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months however we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may from time to time seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions we believe that we have the financial flexibility to attract longterm capital to fund shortterm and longterm growth objectives however no assurances can be given that such longterm capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 

we believe that cash held in the united states in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations are sufficient to fund our united states operating requirements cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses outside of the united states although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to temporary intercompany loans into the united states as of december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states were 8117 million the majority of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the 

united states relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes the potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the united states and the respective foreign jurisdictions 

we have a credit facility which provides up to an aggregate of 7500 million in borrowings in multiple currencies in october 2013 we issued 6000 million of 2875 fixedrate unsecured senior notes due october 15 2018 the proceeds from the notes of 5970 million were used to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes for further information on our longterm debt see note 8 to the  consolidated financial statements  

from time to time we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things expected dilution from stock plans cash capacity and the market price of our common stock the current 7500 million program provides for repurchases through december 31 2016 under this stock repurchase authorization in november 2013 and february 2014 we entered into rule 10b51 plans to repurchase during the period january through april 2014 up to an aggregate total of 3000 million of our common stock in accordance with certain predefined price parameters during 2013 we repurchased a total of 68 million shares at an aggregate cost of 4951 million and as of december 31 2013 had remaining authority to purchase 5025 million of our common stock for further information see note 12 to the  consolidated financial statements  

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 4727 million for 2013 increased 1106 million from 2012 due primarily to 1 the receipt of 836 million from medtronic inc in satisfaction of the april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the us andersen transcatheter heart valve patent 2 increased collection of accounts receivable and 3 improved operating performance these increases were partially offset by 1 a 227 million increase in inventory purchases to support future product launches and 2 a 170 million impact from excess tax benefits from stock plans primarily as a result of the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the united states in 2011 and 2012 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 3621 million for 2012 increased 539 million from 2011 due primarily to 1 improved operating performance 2 a decrease in inventory builds in comparison to the prior year and 3 increased collection of accounts receivable particularly a 263 million nonrecurring collection in spain and the sale of our greek bonds these increases were partially offset by 1 a 505 million impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans primarily the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the united states and 2 the timing of supplier payments 

net cash used in investing activities of 4127 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases of shortterm investments of 2968 million and capital expenditures of 1090 million 

net cash used in investing activities of 788 million in 2012 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 1090 million and a 366 million payment associated with the acquisition of bmeye bv see note 5 to the  consolidated financial statements  partially offset by net proceeds from shortterm investments of 697 million 

net cash provided by financing activities of 349 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net proceeds from debt of 4096 million the excess tax benefit from stock plans of 735 million including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits and proceeds from stock plans of 455 million partially offset by repurchases of common stock of 4969 million

a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2013 were as follows in millions 



a the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31 2013 was 427 million this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets therefore we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table see note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  for further information b contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones c capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and it is not certain if andor when these payments will be made d as of december 31 2013 the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was 1355 million we have entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements  certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting 

principles in the united states gaap in evaluating our transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information we also use outside experts where appropriate we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 

our primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to our united states distributors and represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor at our distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess obsolete and expired inventory we base our provisions for excess obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess obsolete and expired inventory in the future in addition our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess obsolete and expired inventory 

patent costs 

we capitalize certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable the ultimate outcome of these legal actions are not within our complete control 

are difficult to predict and may not be known for prolonged periods of time and therefore the determination to capitalize these costs is a matter of significant judgment 

intangible assets and longlived assets 

we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis the determination of fair value requires significant estimates including but not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the discount rate used to discount those cash flows the assessment of the assets life cycle including the timing and expected costs to complete inprocess projects and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risks 

indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to iprd acquired in business combinations are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value including estimation of future cash flows selection of an appropriate discount rate and estimates of longterm growth rates 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as the progress of tax audits lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law 

for additional details on our income taxes see note 2 and note 15 to the  consolidated financial statements  

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited 

if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

new accounting standards 

information regarding new accounting standards is included in note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

in addition to available cash and cash from operations we use debt to finance business activities we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations as of december 31 2013 we had 6000 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a 7500 million credit facility that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of december 31 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility to diversify our interest rate risk we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million the critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of 3000 million of the debt issuance effectively converting that portion of the fixedrate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6 month libor benchmark based on our year end 2013 variable debt levels a hypothetical 10 increase in our weightedaverage interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2013 a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 60 million respectively this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt 

for more information related to outstanding debt obligations see note 8 to the  consolidated financial statements  

currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our nonunited states subsidiaries into united states dollars currency gains and losses related to intercompany and thirdparty transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts we do not hedge our exposure related to our net investments in our nonunited states subsidiaries the total notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31 2013 and 2012 were 8055 million and 7790 million respectively a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by 553 million and 594 million respectively any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions and would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information related to outstanding foreign exchange contracts see note 2 and note 10 to the  consolidated financial statements  

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy at december 31 2013 all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any nonperformance by our current derivative counterparties 

concentrations of risk 

we invest excess cash in bank time deposits and diversify the investments between financial institutions 

in the normal course of business we provide credit to customers in the health care industry perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2013 we had no customers that represent 10 or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable net 

we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain european countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries in addition we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries 

during 2011 we recorded a 128 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with our southern european receivables primarily greece a significant further decline in sovereign credit ratings or a debt default in these southern european countries may decrease the likelihood that we will collect these accounts receivable which could result in a negative impact to our operating results as of december 31 2013 our accounts receivables net of the allowance for doubtful accounts from customers in certain european countries were 1047 million 

investment risk 

we are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of our investments we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies these investments are classified in  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  on the consolidated balance sheets 

as of december 31 2013 we had 219 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 03 million on these investments in  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary

government regulation and other matters 

the companys products and technologies are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign government agencies including the united states food and drug administration fda and various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of the companys products and technologies the company is also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to the companys business is increasing 

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and recordkeeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that edwards lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of edwards lifesciences products a number of the companys products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or 

preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution the companys compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states which could also subject the company to sanctions for noncompliance 

the company is also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern its business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product • the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider • federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 • the physician payments sunshine act which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of united states physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers including medical device pharmaceutical and biologics companies • the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and • the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute companies in the united states for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the united states failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in the companys compliance efforts the company adheres to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding its sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which it operates in addition the company has in place a dedicated team to improve its internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe the companys products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate the companys products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements 

that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation into japan of medical devices is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which the company markets its products the company may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

• product standards and specifications • packaging requirements • labeling requirements • quality system requirements • import restrictions • tariffs • duties and • tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require the companys products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for the companys products and technologies 

the delivery of the companys products is subject to regulation by the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable several legislative proposals in 

the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs including medicare and medicaid changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and the companys pricing flexibility 

hospital reimbursement in the united states for transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes on may 1 2012 cms issued a national coverage determination ncd that provided nationwide coverage of tavr for patients who either fall within fdaapproved criteria or are part of an approved clinical study the company has always believed a wellwritten ncd that ensures adequate patient access is a positive for patients and physicians 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase the companys operating expenses because many other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on the company is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products 

puerto rico excise tax on october 25 2010 the puerto rican government enacted a new tax law effective for transactions occurring after december 31 2010 the law act 154 modifies puerto rican tax law by imposing a temporary excise tax on intercompany purchases made through 2016 and by adopting a new sourcing rule the company projects that the excise tax impact for 2012 of 59 million will be offset by credits available under the implementing excise tax regulations the financial impact of the new sourcing rule is not expected to be material 

the puerto rican government recently announced plans effective in 2013 to increase the excise tax rate to four percent and to maintain that level through 2017 the company projects that the excise tax impact for 2013 of approximately 53 million will be fully offset by credits 

seasonality 

edwards lifesciences quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 edwards lifesciences had approximately 8200 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located in the united states the dominican republic and singapore other major concentrations of employees are located in europe and japan edwards lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employs a rigorous talent management system none of edwards lifesciences north 

american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america the company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our surgical and transcatheter heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials in addition the sec recently enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the democratic republic of congo if our suppliers cannot certify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas we may need to source components from alternative suppliers if we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our investments asset or business dispositions or for other reasons 

we have equity investments in other companies and we may make similar investments in the future to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment 

at december 31 2012 we had 211 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 14 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 

in addition from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired inprocess research and development either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding health care in general while the economic environment has shown some signs of improvement the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business for example negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our 

ability to borrow an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase our operating expenses because many other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on us is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products for example the budget control act of 2011 which provided an increase to the united states debt limit imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade this measure and other such deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects if they were to result in cuts to or a restructuring of entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

we do business with governments outside the united states a number of these countries including certain european countries have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries in addition we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act as well as with the united kingdoms bribery act and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions our net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 57 in 2012 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs • changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions such as the current financial uncertainties in europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges • potentially negative impact of tax laws including tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash • difficulty in staffing and managing global operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers 14 

• local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables including receivables from sovereign entities • an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing or marketing training and other expenses related to the introduction of new products 15 

• the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition and broader product offerings our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our sales technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development marketing and selling of new and existing products if we are unable to recruit hire develop and retain a talented competitive work force our ability to compete may be adversely affected our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry our position can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design sourcing manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including 

testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution additionally product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against the company and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition the 2010 united states health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong 

relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of edwards lifesciences during the three years ended december 31 2012 also discussed is edwards lifesciences financial position as of december 31 2012 you should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

overview 

edwards lifesciences corporation is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients a pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products edwards lifesciences is the worlds leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patients diseased or defective heart valve the company is also a global leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patients cardiovascular function in the hospital setting 

during the first quarter of 2012 the company began reporting its products and technologies in three new product groups surgical heart valve therapy which combines surgical heart valves and cardiac surgery systems transcatheter heart valves and critical care which includes vascular sales amounts for the prior year periods have been recast to conform with the new product classifications 

edwards lifesciences surgical heart valve therapy portfolio is comprised primarily of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical replacement or repair of a patients heart valve the portfolio also includes a diverse line of products used during minimally invasive surgical procedures and cannulae embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass the companys transcatheter heart valves portfolio includes technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheterbased approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques in the critical care portfolio edwards lifesciences products include pulmonary artery catheters disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems the portfolio also includes a line of balloon catheterbased vascular products surgical clips and inserts 

the health care marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors the company competes with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger with broader product offerings than edwards lifesciences furthermore rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the company competes global demand for health care is increasing as the population ages there is mounting pressure to contain health care costs in the face of this increasing demand which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures the cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic and technology costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change 

in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase the companys operating expenses because many other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on the company is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products 

results of operations 

net sales by major regions dollars in millions 



the 2065 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2012 was due primarily to 

• transcatheter heart valves which increased net sales by 2035 million driven primarily by sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 the 145 million increase in international net sales in 2012 was due primarily to

the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while the company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore the company may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise its right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions 

as a result of ongoing negotiations of an advanced pricing agreement the expiration of statutes of limitations and the possible settlement of ongoing audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months the range of such change could vary but the amount of such change is not expected to be material 

the company has 384 million of california research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods the credits may be carried forward indefinitely based upon anticipated future taxable income the company expects that it is more likely than not that all california research expenditure tax credits will be utilized although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the far distant future accordingly no valuation allowance has been provided 

stockbased compensation 

the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units marketbased restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option 

valuation model the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements the blackscholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the companys results of operations could be impacted

united states regulation in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and recordkeeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that edwards lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of edwards lifesciences products a number of the companys products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or 

preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution the companys compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states which could also subject the company to sanctions for noncompliance 

the company is also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern its business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product • the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider • federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 • the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and • the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute companies in the united states for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the united states failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities to assist in the companys compliance efforts the company adheres to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding its sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which it operates in addition the company has in place and works to improve its internal business compliance programs and policies 

international regulation internationally the regulation of medical devices is complex in europe the companys products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the regulatory regime in the european union for medical devices became mandatory in june 1998 it requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose national laws conforming to the european unions legislation regulate the companys products under the medical devices regulatory system although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the european union medical devices directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions the european union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the ce mark manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body in 

europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 

in japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices clinical studies are subject to a stringent good clinical practices standard approval time frames from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device in addition importation into japan of medical devices is subject to the good import practices regulations as with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales 

in many of the other foreign countries in which the company markets its products the company may be subject to regulations affecting among other things 

• product standards and specifications • packaging requirements • labeling requirements • quality system requirements • import restrictions • tariffs • duties and • tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda in some regions the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs in many countries the national health or social security organizations require the companys products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for the companys products and technologies 

the delivery of the companys products is subject to regulation by the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare cms may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs including medicare and medicaid changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and the companys pricing flexibility 

hospital reimbursement in the united states for transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes in september 2011 cms initiated a national coverage analysis for tavr which was expected to lead to a national coverage determination ncd in february 2012 cms issued a draft ncd and a final ncd is expected by midyear 2012 the company believes a wellwritten ncd that ensures adequate patient access would be positive for patients and physicians the company cannot predict the outcome of this process and a negative determination such as one that restricts the use of its products could have an adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past these larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase the companys operating expenses because many parts of the 2010 healthcare law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on the company is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products 

puerto rico excise tax on october 25 2010 the puerto rican government enacted a new tax law effective for transactions occurring after december 31 2010 the law act 154 modifies puerto rican tax law by imposing a temporary excise tax on intercompany purchases made through 2016 and by adopting a new sourcing rule the company projects that the excise tax impact for 2011 of 61 million will be offset by credits available under the implementing excise tax regulations the financial impact of the new sourcing rule is not expected to be material 

seasonality 

edwards lifesciences quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 edwards lifesciences had approximately 7800 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located at the companys headquarters in irvine california and at its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic other major concentrations of employees are located in europe japan and singapore edwards lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employs a rigorous talent management system none of edwards lifesciences north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america the company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment in addition forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties please read the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements in item 7 below 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new or improved products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors we devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities however the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty accordingly products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and 

manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials if we are unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body which include detailed recordkeeping requirements our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be required from time to time to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our investments asset or business dispositions the termination of interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons 

we have equity investments in other companies and we may make similar investments in the future to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment 

at december 31 2011 we had 218 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 11 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 

in addition from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons 

if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and may do so from time to time in the future in the event that we elect to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity we could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired inprocess research and development either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability and the political environment regarding healthcare in general while the economic environment has shown some signs of improvement the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business for example an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition these and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis 

in 2010 significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires 

the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase our operating expenses because many parts of the 2010 healthcare law remain subject to implementation the longterm impact on us is uncertain the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products the budget control act of 2011 which provided an increase to the united states debt limit imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade subsequently as a result of the inability of a bipartisan congressional committee to agree on further deficit reduction certain additional mandatory spending cuts will take effect in the future unless congress and the president agree otherwise in addition alternative deficit reduction proposals could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects if they were to include cuts to or a restructuring of entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid programs 

we do business with foreign governments outside the united states a number of these countries including certain european countries have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions these conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries in addition we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act as well as with the united kingdoms bribery act and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions our net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 64 in 2011 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs • changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions such as the current financial uncertainties in europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges • potentially negative impact of tax laws including tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash • difficulty in staffing and managing global operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers • local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables including receivables from sovereign entities • an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property 14 

substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found and if found the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors • changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing or marketing training and other expenses related to the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products 15 

• increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability breadth of product line clinical outcomes product availability price availability and rate of reimbursement and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry market share can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the healthcare industry has been consolidating and organizations such as gpos independent delivery networks and large single accounts such as the united states veterans administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations we expect that market demand governmental regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we expect to continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions the expiration of or the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr ce mark iso or similar requirements this could delay or interrupt product production or sales andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests 

that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution additionally product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against the company and our officers and employees including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

despite our implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the applicable governmental authority can impose fines delay suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and institute criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

in recent years the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny including by the fda numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities as well as members of congress this has included increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities both foreign and domestic may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding this clinical data could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects such clinical trials are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

hospital reimbursement in the united states for tavr procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes in september 2011 cms initiated a national coverage analysis for tavr which was expected to lead to a ncd in february 2012 cms issued a draft ncd and a final ncd is expected by midyear 2012 we believe a wellwritten ncd that ensures adequate patient access would be positive for patients and physicians we cannot predict the outcome of this process and a negative determination such as one that restricts the use of our products could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price 

levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition the 2010 united states healthcare law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities 

the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are or are expected to be limited to specific indications we are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products physicians however can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval although the product training we provide to physicians and other healthcare professionals is limited to approved uses no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 2514 million for 2010 increased 861 million from 2009 due primarily to 1 a 390 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the companys accounts receivable securitization program in japan 2 lower supplier payments in 2010 compared to 2009 and 3 higher operating profits these increases were partially offset by higher inventory purchases in 2010 primarily related to the transcatheter heart valve product line and the negative impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans due to the appreciation in the companys stock price and increased exercises which is offset in financing activities

a summary of all of the companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2011 were as follows in millions 



a the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to the companys various pension plans anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable the total accrued benefit liability for the companys pension plans recognized as of december 31 2011 was 418 million this 

amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets therefore the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table see note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  for further information 

b contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones c capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and it is not certain if andor when these payments will be made d as of december 31 2011 the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was 812 million as a result of ongoing negotiations of an advanced pricing agreement between switzerland and the united states the expiration of statutes of limitations and the possible settlement of ongoing audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months the range of such change could vary but the amount of such change is not expected to be material 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the companys accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain of the companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating the companys transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates as it relates to the company estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves rebate reserves allowances for doubtful accounts reserves for excess and obsolete inventory investments in unconsolidated affiliates the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions workers compensation liabilities employee benefit related liabilities income taxes impairments of assets forecasted transactions to be hedged litigation reserves and contingencies 

these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information the company also uses outside experts where appropriate the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product provided that an agreement of sale exists the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 

the companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

the companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the companys united states distributors and represents the difference between the companys sales price to the distributor at the companys distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates the company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

the company also offers volume rebates to certain gpos and customers based upon target sales levels for volume rebates offered to gpos the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo for volume rebates offered to customers the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid the company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customerspecific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions the credit and economic conditions within italy spain portugal and greece among other members of the european union have deteriorated as these countries have experienced slower economic growth and higher debt levels when evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to these european receivables the companys analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customers ability to comply with credit terms economic conditions and procedures implemented by the company to collect the historical receivables additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as financial difficulty the allowance for doubtful accounts was 190 million and 116 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated a writedown for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration is damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was 129 million and 112 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

patent costs 

the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications the company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks these capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in evaluating goodwill the company completes a twostep goodwill impairment test the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities including existing goodwill to those reporting units the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the companys market capitalization and a market revenue multiple if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value in 2011 2010 and 2009 the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 

additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable impairment indicators include among other conditions cash flow deficits historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates are longterm equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development certain of these investments are designated as availableforsale these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as  accumulated other comprehensive loss  gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting as appropriate the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations whereby the company owns a minimum of 5 of the investees outstanding voting stock under the equity method of accounting these investments are recorded at the amount of the companys investment and adjusted each period for the companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value 

when the fair value of an availableforsale investment declines below cost management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered otherthantemporary and result in a recognized loss 

• the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost • the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee • the reasons for the decline in market value 39 

• the investees performance against product development milestones and • the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount if necessary the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating the companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort for tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot threshold the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority 

the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while the company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore the company may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise its right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions 

as a result of ongoing negotiations of an advanced pricing agreement the expiration of statutes of limitations and the possible settlement of ongoing audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months the range of such change could vary but the amount of such change is not expected to be material 

the company has approximately 295 million of california research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods the credits may be carried forward indefinitely based upon anticipated future taxable income over an extended number of years the company expects all california research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized accordingly no valuation allowance has been provided 

stockbased compensation 

the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is 

required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the companys results of operations could be impacted 

new accounting standards not yet adopted 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on fair value measurements to ensure that united states gaap and international financial reporting standards have common requirements for fair value measurement and disclosures including a consistent definition of fair value the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income the guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on goodwill to permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the guidance requires an entity to disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

government regulation and other matters 

regulatory environment the companys products and technologies are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign government agencies including the united states food and drug administration fda and various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of the companys products and technologies the company is also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to the companys business is increasing 

in the united states the fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling promotion and recordkeeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that edwards lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements the process of obtaining fda clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of edwards lifesciences products a number of the companys products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets including 

the edwards sapien transcatheter valve in the united states ultimately the fda may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative the fda also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements the fda may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health additionally the failure to comply with fda or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution the companys compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review moreover the fda and several other united states agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states which could also subject the company to sanctions for noncompliance 

medical device laws are also in effect in most markets around the world including europe japan and many other countries similar to the united states laws foreign regulations include importexport regulation inspection requirements comprehensive device approval requirements requests for product data certifications or recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices in addition the process of obtaining foreign approval to market a product or complying with product data requests can be resource intensive lengthy and costly and such requirements may or may not be more rigorous than those required in the united states foreign regulations can also subject the company to penalties for noncompliance criminal sanctions and the revocation of its license to conduct business in a foreign jurisdiction 

the company is also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern its business operations products and technologies including 

• federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product • the stark law which prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider • federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 • the false claims act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payor and • the united states foreign corrupt practices act which can be used to prosecute companies in the united states for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the united states failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement 

activities to assist in the companys compliance efforts the company adheres to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding its sales and marketing activities in the united states and other countries in which it operates in addition the company has in place and works to improve its internal business compliance programs and policies 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies for example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payors require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for the companys products and technologies 

the delivery of the companys products is subject to regulation by the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs including medicare and medicaid changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and the companys pricing flexibility 

health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform in 2010 significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase the companys operating expenses the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products 

puerto rico excise tax on october 25 2010 the puerto rican government enacted a new tax law effective for transactions occurring after december 31 2010 the law act 154 modifies puerto rican tax law by imposing a temporary excise tax on intercompany purchases made through 2016 and by adopting a new sourcing rule the company projects that the excise tax impact for 2011 of approximately 60 million will be offset by credits available under the implementing excise tax regulations the financial impact of the new sourcing rule is not expected to be material 

seasonality 

edwards lifesciences quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors 

net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 edwards lifesciences had approximately 7000 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located at the companys headquarters in irvine california and at its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic other major concentrations of employees are located in europe japan and singapore edwards lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employs a rigorous talent management system none of edwards lifesciences north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america the company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements the general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure certain suppliers have announced in the past that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices if we are unable to obtain these raw materials our business could be harmed 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials if we are unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacturing of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be required to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our investments the disposition of some of our businesses the termination of interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons 

we have equity investments in other companies and we may make similar investments in the future to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment 

at december 31 2010 we had 250 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 22 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 

in addition from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and may do so from time to time in the future in the event that we elect to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity we could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development assets to the extent that the value of these assets declines we may be required to write down the value of the assets also in connection with certain asset acquisitions we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired inprocess research and development either of these situations could result in substantial charges which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also require the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions such as interest rates and tax rates and the political environment regarding healthcare in general for example an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could also impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and could result in impairments in the carrying value of our investments and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in 2010 significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states the law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose 

increased taxes specifically the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 23 excise tax on united states sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013 the excise tax will increase the companys operating expenses the new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes lower reimbursement for the companys products and impact the demand for the companys products or the prices at which the company sells its products 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act as well as with the united kingdoms bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions our net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 61 in 2010 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs • unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging regions • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges • potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing global operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers • an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in 

response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors • changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • changes in governmental reimbursement rates for our products • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability clinical outcomes product availability price and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry market share can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the healthcare industry has been consolidating and as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing as an example many existing and potential domestic customers for our products have combined to form gpos gpos negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of gpos if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo we may be precluded from making sales to members of a gpo even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on 

purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through new patents or patent term extensions the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we may be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation could be costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties such licenses may materially increase our expenses if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study design manufacturing packaging marketing advertising promotion and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing design quality control and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting recalls or corrections field actions the conduct of clinical studies and other requirements in the european union we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr iso or similar requirements this could delay product production andor lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and clearances or approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain clearances or approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations or other regulatory requirements noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties product seizure injunction or criminal prosecution additionally product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

in recent years both the united states and foreign government regulators have increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry including increased united states government oversight including misbranding investigations and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act in addition the recently enacted united kingdom bribery act as well as similar laws in other jurisdictions could give rise to increased enforcement of prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments despite implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject from time to time to increased regulation as well as inspections investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities whenever the united states or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations such governmental authority can impose fines delay or suspend or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose marketing 

or operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future 

our medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation including by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities and members of congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry in addition certain states have recently passed or are considering legislation restricting our interactions with health care providers and requiring disclosure of certain payments to them also while recent case law has clarified that the fdas authority over certain medical devices preempts state tort laws legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may increase compliance costs exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations 

unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the development of new products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures such clinical trials are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition recently enacted legislation in the united states to reform health care policies could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them resulting in lower sales of our products 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product trainers and consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and 

marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

earlier in may 2007 the company filed a lawsuit against corevalve alleging infringement of the companys european andersen patent the lawsuit was filed in the district patent court in dusseldorf 

germany seeking injunctive and declaratory relief in october 2008 the court rejected this assertion and dismissed the infringement lawsuit in february 2010 a german appeals court affirmed in may 2007 and june 2007 corevalve filed separate lawsuits in london united kingdom and munich germany respectively alleging the patent to be invalid the company then asserted that corevalves revalving system infringes the andersen patent in the united kingdom in january 2009 the united kingdom court determined that the andersen patent is valid but not infringed by corevalve in may 2010 a united kingdom appeals court affirmed the lower court in january 2010 the german courts also determined that the andersen patent is valid in december 2010 these lawsuits were resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement between the parties 

in february 2008 cook inc cook filed a lawsuit in the district patent court in dusseldorf germany against edwards lifesciences alleging that the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve infringes on a cook patent edwards lifesciences subsequently filed lawsuits in london united kingdom and in munich germany against cook alleging that the patents were invalid in the united kingdom lawsuit cook counterclaimed alleging infringement by edwards in march 2009 the german courts ruled that the company does not infringe the cook patent in june 2009 the united kingdom court also ruled that the company does not infringe the cook patent and further that the cook patent is invalid in june 2010 a united kingdom appeals court affirmed in april 2010 the german courts also determined that the cook patent is invalid 

in march and september 2010 the company received grand jury subpoenas for documents from the united states attorneys office in the central district of california in connection with an investigation by the fda the subpoenas to the company seek records relating to the vigilance i monitor model with software release 53 that was the subject of a voluntary field recall by the company in june 2006 the company is cooperating fully with the investigation 

in addition edwards lifesciences is or may be a party to or may otherwise be responsible for pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed as applicable by edwards lifesciences such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim edwards lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves while any such charge could have a material adverse impact on edwards lifesciences net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences financial position results of operations or liquidity 

edwards lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the united states the operations of edwards lifesciences like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on edwards lifesciences financial position results of operations or liquidity

these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information the company also uses outside experts where appropriate the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product provided that an agreement of sale exists the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 

the companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 

the companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the companys united states distributors and represents the difference between the companys sales price to the distributor at the companys distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributors inventory this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates the company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

the company also offers volume rebates to certain gpos and customers based upon target sales levels for volume rebates offered to gpos the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo for volume rebates offered to customers the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and 

accounts receivable the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid the company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customerspecific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as financial difficulty the allowance for doubtful accounts was 116 million and 124 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated a writedown for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration is damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was 112 million and 109 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

patent costs 

the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications the company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks these capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets 

the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in evaluating goodwill the company completes a twostep goodwill impairment test the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities including existing goodwill to those reporting units the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the companys market capitalization and a market revenue multiple if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value in 2010 2009 and 2008 the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 

additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable impairment indicators include among other conditions cash flow deficits historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates are longterm equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development certain of these investments are designated as availableforsale these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as  accumulated other comprehensive loss  gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting as appropriate the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations whereby the company owns a minimum of 5 of the investees outstanding voting stock under the equity method of accounting these investments are recorded at the amount of the companys investment and adjusted each period for the companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value 

when the fair value of an availableforsale investment declines below cost management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered otherthantemporary and result in a recognized loss 

• the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost • the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee • the reasons for the decline in market value • the investees performance against product development milestones and • the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating the companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort for tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot threshold the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority 

the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while the company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore the company may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise its right to appeal the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as 

lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions 

as a result of ongoing negotiations of various advanced pricing agreements the expiration of statutes of limitations and the possible settlement of ongoing audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months the range of such change could vary but the amount of such change is not expected to be material 

the company has significant california research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods the credits may be carried forward indefinitely based upon anticipated future taxable income the company expects all california research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized accordingly no valuation allowance has been provided 

stockbased compensation 

the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including stock price volatility riskfree interest rate and expected option term stockbased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and the companys results of operations could be impacted

proprietary technology 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to the success of edwards lifesciences business edwards lifesciences also relies upon trade secrets knowhow continuing innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position 

edwards lifesciences owns more than 1000 issued united states patents pending united states patent applications issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications the company also has licensed various united states and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of edwards lifesciences products including its heart valves and annuloplasty rings and systems edwards lifesciences also owns or has rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement in addition edwards lifesciences owns or has rights in united states and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring and vascular access products 

edwards lifesciences is a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which it has obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross licensing rights or royalty payments edwards lifesciences has also licensed certain patent rights to others 

edwards lifesciences monitors the products of its competitors for possible infringement of edwards lifesciences owned andor licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by edwards lifesciences and the company plans to continue to defend and prosecute its rights with respect to such patents 

edwards lifesciences owns certain united states registered trademarks used in its business many company trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and edwards lifesciences has determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

regulatory environment in the united states the food and drug administration fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development manufacturing labeling and recordkeeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that edwards lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval requirements the process of obtaining fda approval to market a product is resourceintensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of edwards lifesciences products 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices the fda also may require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may enjoin and restrain certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations moreover the fda administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states 

a number of edwards lifesciences products are pending regulatory approval to begin commercial sales including the edwards sapien thv in the united states and the edwards sapien xt thv the novaflex delivery system and ascendra 2 delivery system in europe 

medical device laws are also in effect in most markets around the world including europe japan and many other countries where edwards lifesciences does business similar to the regulations imposed by the fda the regulations in these countries range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys products to requests for product data certifications or recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices the process of obtaining approval to market a product andor complying with product data requests can be resourceintensive lengthy and costly and such requirements may or may not be more rigorous than those required by the fda overall the number and scope of government regulations and requirements are increasing 

edwards lifesciences also is governed by federal state local and foreign laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety in addition edwards lifesciences is subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations including those governing the adverse impact on the environment 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies 

reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government through the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs including medicare and medicaid 

over the years health care cost containment efforts have prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

health care reform government initiatives to slow the rising costs associated with health care and expand access to uninsured residents of the united states are being considered by congress some proposals would fund a portion of the cost of expanded health care access through a tax or fee levied on medical device manufacturers although it is unlikely that such a tax or fee will be effective in 2010 any such initiatives could ultimately put pressure on the product pricing and profitability of medical device companies including edwards lifesciences 

seasonality 

edwards lifesciences quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer procedures 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 edwards lifesciences had approximately 6400 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located at the companys headquarters in irvine california and at its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic other major concentrations of employees are located in europe japan and singapore edwards lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and 

employs a very rigorous talent management system none of edwards lifesciences north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america the company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement or other factors 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income or net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements the global recession and general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial 

viability of our suppliers resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products while we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with this regulatory process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure certain suppliers have announced in the past that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices if we are unable to obtain these raw materials our business could be harmed 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials if we are unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacturing of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be required to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our investments the disposition of some of our businesses the termination of interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons 

we have equity investments in other companies and we may make similar investments in the future to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment 

at december 31 2009 we had 223 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized losses of 10 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax 

in addition from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related 

to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and we expect to continue to do so from time to time in the future in the event that we elect to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity we could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development charges which could be significant in the past we have taken significant inprocess research and development charges in connection with acquisitions and may take similar charges in connection with future acquisitions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also require the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general economic conditions such as interest rates and tax rates and the political environment regarding healthcare in general for example an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets in addition health care reform initiatives currently being considered by the united states congress could result in additional taxes or fees levied on the medical device industry in connection with expanding access to and containing costs associated with health care uninsured residents of the united states although it is unlikely that such taxes or fees will be effective in 2010 such initiatives could ultimately affect reimbursement levels or otherwise put pressure on the companys product pricing and profitability 

the global recession and turmoil in the credit markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the uncertainty arising from domestic and global economic conditions including disruption in the credit markets and the impact on the overall economy could adversely impact our customers suppliers creditors and counterparties to derivative contracts with a corresponding adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our 

ability to borrow these conditions have resulted in decreased liquidity as well as a decline in value of many investments and could result in impairments in the carrying value of our investments and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as part of our risk management program we may enter into interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts with counterparties in the financial services industry which industry has come under considerable pressure the financial instability of any of these counterparties could result in losses or impairments to the value of our financial assets although sales of our products are not generally sensitive to economic conditions the uncertain economic conditions and pressure on government and hospital budgets could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability in addition if our customers experience financial difficulties the company could incur increased bad debt expense or writeoffs of accounts receivable likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit or other financial difficulties they may be unable to provide the materials required to manufacture our products 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally including risks associated with united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act our net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 58 in 2009 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs • unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging regions • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges • potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers • an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our foreigngenerated sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of foreign sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors • changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability clinical outcomes product availability price and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry market share can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the healthcare industry has been consolidating and as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing as an example many existing and potential domestic customers for our products have combined to form gpos gpos negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of gpos if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo we may be precluded from making sales to members of a gpo even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through new patents or patent term extensions the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we may be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation could be costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study manufacturing packaging marketing and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr iso or similar requirements this could delay product production and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

we are also subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

in recent years both the united states and foreign government regulators have increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry including increased united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act despite implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject to more regulation enforcement inspections and investigations by governmental authorities in the future whenever the united states or 

another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations such governmental authority can impose fines delay or suspend regulatory clearances institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products and development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the development of new products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures such clinical trials are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results further preliminary results from clinical trials may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if thirdparty payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from thirdparty payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

thirdparty payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or 

reimbursement policies of thirdparty payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies in addition current united states government initiatives to reform health care policies could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability 

initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing could be adversely affected 

thirdparty payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such thirdparty payors or was used for an unapproved indication thirdparty payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these thirdparty payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by thirdparty payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

fair value measurements 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value the company uses various valuation approaches including market income andor cost approaches and considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability the company prioritizes the inputs used to determine fair value in one of the following three categories 



in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 

when possible the company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities when identical assets or liabilities are not traded in active markets the company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain the company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement the company has procedures to independently verify and test valuations received from third parties

edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the derivative instruments used include optionbased products and forward currency contracts the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes the total notional amounts of the companys derivative financial instruments at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 3431 million and 2251 million respectively the notional amounts of optionbased products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the companys exposure through its use of derivatives 

interest rate risk 

as part of its overall riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 15 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the companys weightedaverage interest rate affecting the companys financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments would have an immaterial effect on the companys annual interest expense 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets any changes in the carrying value of 

these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and optionbased products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations optionbased products consist of purchased put options and at times written sold call options to create collars optionbased products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive or require the company to make payments at specified currency rate levels 

as part of its riskmanagement process the company uses a valueatrisk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14day holding period to estimate this potential loss the companys calculated var at december 31 2009 and 2008 with a maturity of up to one year was 45 million and 57 million respectively this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances the companys calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in the companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods in addition the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse which may not be the case any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures there may be currency exchangerate gains or losses in the future 

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments used by the company involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines counterparty diversification monitoring of counterparty financial condition and masternetting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december 31 2009 reduced by the effects of masternetting agreements additionally at december 31 2009 all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of a or better by national rating agencies the company does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to nonperformance as of december 31 2009 the company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in april 2000 

concentrations of credit risk 

in the normal course of business edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2009 the company had no customers that represent greater than 10 of its total net sales or accounts receivable net 

investment risk 

edwards lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies these investments are classified in  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  on the consolidated balance sheets

edwards lifesciences owns certain united states registered trademarks used in its business many company trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and edwards lifesciences has determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

regulatory environment in the united states the food and drug administration fda has responsibility for regulating medical devices the fda regulates design development manufacturing labeling and recordkeeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that edwards lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval requirements the process of obtaining fda approval to market a product is resourceintensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of edwards lifesciences products 

the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices the fda also may require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may enjoin and restrain certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations moreover the fda administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states 

medical device laws are also in effect in most markets around the world including europe japan and many other countries where edwards lifesciences does business similar to the regulations imposed by the 

fda the regulations in these countries range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys products to requests for product data certifications or recordkeeping the process of obtaining approval to market a product andor complying with product data requests can be resourceintensive lengthy and costly and such requirements may or may not be more rigorous than those required by the fda overall the number and scope of government regulations and requirements are increasing 

edwards lifesciences also is governed by federal state local and foreign laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety in addition edwards lifesciences is subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations including those governing the adverse impact on the environment 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies 

reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government through the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare in response to rising medicare and medicaid costs several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

seasonality 

edwards lifesciences quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the united states and european markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer procedures

materially harmed in that case the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new and improved products our products could become technologically obsolete and our revenue and operating results would suffer even if we are able to develop new products our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over third party reimbursement or other factors 

technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these projects in addition even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features 

we may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges including the establishment of any such reserves could have a material adverse impact on our net income or net cash flows 

we may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products 

we use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products our heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials our nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals we purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements while we work closely with suppliers to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda regarding the manufacture of our products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with this regulatory process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us 

in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure certain suppliers have announced in the past that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices if we are unable to obtain these raw materials our business could be harmed 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products in these circumstances transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials if we are unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use in a timely manner our business could be harmed 

some of our suppliers are located outside the united states as a result trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the united states could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business 

the manufacturing of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems our business could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body our reputation could be damaged we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall we could incur product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be required to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of our investments the disposition of some of our businesses the termination of interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons 

we have equity investments in other companies and we may make similar investments in the future to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment 

at december 31 2008 we had 147 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized losses of 57 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss income net of tax 

in addition from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business we may seek to dispose of these under performing businesses or products we may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations 

historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and we expect to continue to do so from time to time in the future in the event that we elect to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity we could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

we regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses moreover we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance 

we may be required to take charges or writedowns in connection with acquisitions in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development charges which could be significant in the past we have taken significant inprocess research and development charges in connection with acquisitions and may take similar charges in connection with future acquisitions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

future acquisitions could also require the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in addition equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available 

general economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

external factors can affect our profitability and financial condition such external factors include general economic conditions such as interest rates and tax rates and the political environment regarding healthcare in general for example an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets in addition the recent change in the administration of the united states government could result in significant changes in healthcare policies and regulations it is likely that there will be proposals for such changes by the administration legislators regulators third party payors and healthcare providers including proposals to contain healthcare costs while we believe our products are appropriately and competitively priced if enacted such proposals could affect the prices or reimbursement levels for our products 

the recent decline in the global economy and turmoil in the credit markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the current uncertainty arising from domestic and global economic conditions including the recent disruption in credit markets poses a risk to the overall economy that could adversely impact our customers suppliers creditors and counterparties to derivative contracts with a corresponding adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds and could negatively impact our ability to borrow these conditions have also resulted in decreased liquidity as well as a decline in value of many investments and could result in impairments in the carrying value of our investments and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as part of our risk management program we enter into interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts with counterparties in the financial services industry which industry has come under considerable pressure recently the financial instability of any of these counterparties could result in losses or impairments to the value of our financial assets although sales of our products are not generally sensitive to economic conditions the current 

economic conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability in addition if our customers experience financial difficulties the company could incur increased bad debt expense or writeoffs of accounts receivable likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit or other financial difficulties they may be unable to provide the materials required to manufacture our products 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally our net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 56 in 2008 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs • unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging regions • trade protection measures quotas embargoes import or export licensing requirements and duties tariffs or surcharges • potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations • cultural exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers • an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease • economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of our foreigngenerated sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of our foreigngenerated sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of foreign sales has remained constant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies have the opposite effect and if significant could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations we have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price regardless of our operating results in addition the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in 

response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry 

our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock could fall other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors • changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products • changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other regions in which we do business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses and • our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansionrelated expenditures we face intense competition and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources our customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability clinical outcomes product availability price and services provided by the manufacturer in addition our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems physician advisories and safety alerts reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry market share can shift as a result of any of these factors see  competition  under  business  included herein 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

the healthcare industry has been consolidating and as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing as an example many existing and potential domestic customers for our products have combined to form gpos gpos negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of gpos if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo we may be 

precluded from making sales to members of a gpo even if we are one of the selected providers we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property and we will continue to do so although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as our patents expire we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through new patents or patent term extensions the failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other third parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information 

we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights sometimes resulting in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and timeconsuming however our efforts in this regard may not be successful we may not be able to detect infringement in addition competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries enabling our competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry from time to time we may be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such intellectual property litigation could be costly and timeconsuming adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or if possible negotiate licenses from such third parties if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license we might have to exit a particular product offering 

we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations in addition failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the 

composition labeling testing clinical study manufacturing packaging pricing marketing and distribution of our products 

we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer as a result we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr iso or similar requirements this could delay product production and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

we are also subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 

in recent years both the united states and foreign government regulators have increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry including increased united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act despite implementation of robust compliance processes we may be subject to more regulation enforcement inspections and investigations by governmental authorities in the future whenever the united states or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations such governmental authority can impose fines delay or suspend regulatory clearances institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims 

and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above commencement of an enforcement proceeding inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products and development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects 

the development of new products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures such clinical trials are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner or result in a commercially viable product failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects clinical trials may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results in addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 

we are subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of our products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if third party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed 

we sell our products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third party payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies 

initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for our products under a 

government operated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels our product pricing may be adversely affected 

third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such third party payors or was used for an unapproved indication third party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices we believe that many of our existing and future products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time we cannot be certain that these third party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if our products are not considered costeffective by third party payors our customers may not be reimbursed for them 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs 

our operations are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things the generation handling transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and emissions or discharges into the air or water we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental health and safety laws and regulations new laws and regulations violations of these laws or regulations stricter enforcement of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material 

the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians 

the development marketing and sales of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience these physicians may assist us as researchers marketing consultants product consultants inventors and as public speakers if new laws regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our products could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

net sales trends 

the following is a summary of united states and international net sales dollars in millions 



the 570 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2008 was due primarily to 

• cardiovations mis products which increased net sales by 237 million the company purchased the cardiovations mis product line in december 2007 • lifestent products all of which are recorded in the united states in 2008 which increased net sales by 137 million lifestent sales include endcustomer sales recorded prior to the divestiture of lifestent in midjanuary 2008 and sales after the divestiture resulting from the ongoing manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement which will continue until the earlier of mid2010 or the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer • critical care products which increased net sales by 138 million driven primarily by the flotrac minimally invasive monitoring system hemofiltration products and pressure monitoring products and • heart valve therapy products which increased net sales by 73 million driven primarily by the carpentieredwards perimount magna with thermafix valve and the magna mitral valve partially offset by a reduction in net sales due to the voluntary retrieval of the companys myxo and imr etlogix repair products pending fda clearance of its 510k submissions 22 

the 896 million increase in international net sales in 2008 was due primarily to 

• heart valve therapy products which increased net sales by 851 million driven primarily by the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve the carpentieredwards perimount magna ease valve and the launch of the magna aortic valve in japan and • critical care products which increased net sales by 402 million driven primarily by the flotrac minimally invasive monitoring system pressure monitoring products and hemofiltration products partially offset by 

• a decrease of 413 million related to the discontinuation of distributed sales in japan of intraaortic balloon pumps and the divestiture of the lifestent product line the benefit of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations included above increased net sales by 373 million due primarily to the strengthening of the euro and japanese yen against the united states dollar 

the 87 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2007 was due primarily to

a the amount included in less than 1 year reflects anticipated contributions to the companys various pension plans anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable the total accrued benefit liability for the companys pension plans recognized as of december 31 2008 was 325 million this amount is impacted by among other items pension expense funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs the company did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table see note 11 to the  consolidated financial statements  for further information b contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones c capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and it is not certain if andor when these payments will be made d as of december 31 2008 the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was 384 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows associated with these liabilities the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the companys accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain of the companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating the companys transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates as it relates to the company estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves rebate reserves allowances for doubtful accounts reserves for excess and obsolete inventory investments in unconsolidated 

affiliates the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions workers compensation liabilities employee benefit related liabilities income taxes any impairments of assets forecasted transactions to be hedged litigation reserves and contingencies 

these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information the company also uses outside experts where appropriate the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product provided that an agreement of sale exists the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 

the companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted the companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates and reflect other limitations 

the companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the companys united states distributors and represents the difference between the companys sales price to the distributor at the companys distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from the largest distributors this customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates the company continually monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

the company also offers volume rebates to certain gpos and customers based upon target sales levels these volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid the company continually monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt an allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customerspecific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as financial difficulty the allowance for doubtful accounts was 99 million and 75 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration is damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was 132 million and 149 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively

impairment of longlived assets 

the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in evaluating goodwill the company completes the twostep goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 142  goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 142 the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities including existing goodwill to those reporting units the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value since the adoption of sfas 142 the company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 

additionally in accordance with sfas 142 and sfas 144 management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable impairment indicators include among other conditions cash flow deficits historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates are longterm strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development certain of these investments are designated as availableforsale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 115  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas 115 these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as  accumulated other comprehensive loss income  gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting as appropriate the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations whereby the company owns a minimum of 5 of the investees outstanding voting stock under the equity method of accounting these investments are recorded at the amount of the companys investment and adjusted each period for the companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value 

when the fair value of an availableforsale investment declines below cost management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered otherthantemporary and result in a recognized loss 

• the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost • the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee • the reasons for the decline in market value • the investees performance against product development milestones and • the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value income taxes 

income taxes are determined under guidelines prescribed by sfas no 109  accounting for income taxes  sfas 109 under these guidelines deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating the companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes as required by the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  fin 48 the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort for tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot threshold the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense

the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period vesting period upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units the company issues common stock 

fair value measurements 

on january 1 2008 the company adopted sfas no 157  fair value measurements  sfas 157 with respect to its financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis the company has deferred the application of the provisions of this statement for its nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with fasb staff position fsp 1572  effective date of fasb statement no 157  fsp 1572 fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value the company uses various valuation approaches including market income andor cost approaches and considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability upon adoption of sfas 157 the company applied the following fair value hierarchy 

level 1—quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

level 2—inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly 

level 3—unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 

in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 

when possible the company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities when identical assets or liabilities are not traded in active markets the company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain the company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement the company has procedures to independently verify and test valuations received from third parties 

the financial assets and liabilities that the company records at fair value include investments in marketable securities residual interests in securitizations and derivative instruments 

investments in marketable securities 

• bank of america columbia strategic cash fund the company holds an investment in the bank of america columbia strategic cash fund a private placement money market mutual fund which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in december 2007 resulting in the companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash the fair value of the companys remaining investment in this fund was estimated based on the net asset value of the fund as of december 31 2008 the net asset value of the fund was 8266 of par 

the fair value of the underlying securities held by the fund was determined based on quoted market prices or broker quotes when possible in the absence of observable market quotations the underlying securities were valued based on alternative valuation techniques using inputs that may not be observable 

in these cases the fair value was based on available information believed to be reliable which may be affected by conditions in the financial markets different market participants may reach different opinions as to the value of any particular security based on their varying market outlooks the market information available to them and the particular circumstances of their portfolios a decrease in the net asset value of 1 or 83 basis points would result in a decrease of approximately 01 million in the investment fair value the companys investment in the fund is categorized as level 3 based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 

• investments held for the executive deferred compensation plan the company holds investments in trading securities related to its executive deferred compensation plan the fair values of the securities are based on quoted market prices and are categorized as level 1 

• investments in unconsolidated affiliates certain of the companys investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as availableforsale in accordance with the provisions of sfas 115 these investments are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices and are categorized as level 1 

residual interest in securitizations 

when the company sells accounts receivable securitizations a subordinated residual interest in the securitized portfolio is retained by the company the company estimates the fair value of the residual interest using the net carrying amount of the accounts receivables less the discount paid on the sale of the receivables this amount is calculated using future expected credit losses and calculated contractual rebates to distributors to determine the future expected cash flows which generally approximate fair value given the securitized portfolios shortterm weightedaverage life reserves for credit losses included in the allowance for doubtful accounts are adjusted based on managements assessment of recovery 

the united states securitization program was terminated in august 2008 and all receivables sold under this facility were repurchased by the company the residual interest in the japan securitization program is categorized as level 3 

derivative instruments 

the company uses forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to forecasted intercompany and third party foreign currency transactions all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value the fair value for derivatives is determined based on indicative midmarket data levels for spot rate and forward points as of the close of business on december 31 2008 all values are discounted to present from the expiry date the values of options are calculated based on the forward implied volatilities to the expiry date the models used for valuations are based upon well recognized financial principles and the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources although readily observable data is used in the valuations different valuation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair value the derivative instruments are categorized as level 2

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including currency exchange rates and interest rates the companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs 

edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps optionbased products and forward currency contracts the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes the total notional amounts of the companys derivative financial instruments at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 2251 million and 3362 million respectively the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements optionbased products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the companys exposure through its use of derivatives 

interest rate risk 

the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis there were no interest rate swaps in effect as of december 31 2008 

as part of its overall riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 14 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the companys weightedaverage interest rate affecting the companys financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments would have an immaterial effect on the companys annual interest expense 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the 

carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and optionbased products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations optionbased products consist of purchased put options and at times written sold call options to create collars optionbased products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive or require the company to make payments at specified currency rate levels 

as part of its riskmanagement process the company uses a valueatrisk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14day holding period to estimate this potential loss the companys calculated var at december 31 2008 and 2007 with a maturity of up to one year was 57 million and 51 million respectively this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances the companys calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in the companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods in addition the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse which may not be the case any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures there may be currency exchangerate gains or losses in the future 

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments used by the company involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines counterparty diversification monitoring of counterparty financial condition and masternetting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december 31 2008 reduced by the effects of masternetting agreements additionally at december 31 2008 all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of a or better by national rating agencies the company does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to nonperformance as of december 31 2008 the company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in april 2000 

concentrations of credit risk 

in the normal course of business edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2008 the company had no customers that represent greater than 10 of its total net sales or accounts receivable net 

investment risk 

edwards lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies these investments are classified in  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  on the consolidated balance sheets

as previously announced in february 2007 the los angeles district office of the fda issued a warning letter to the company resulting from the fdas inspection of the companys facility in irvine california that concluded in august 2006 the warning letter related specifically to elements of the companys quality systems including complaint handling documentation and quality systems training in april 2007 the fda formally notified edwards lifesciences that the companys response to the fdas february 2007 warning letter adequately addressed their concerns the fda inspected the companys irvine facility in january 2008 to follow up on the commitments edwards made to the fda following the 2006 inspection the company is promptly addressing the issues raised in this inspection 

medical device laws are also in effect in most markets around the world including europe japan and many other countries where edwards lifesciences does business similar to the regulations imposed by the fda the regulations in these countries range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys products to requests for product data certifications or recordkeeping the process of obtaining approval to market a product andor complying with product data requests can be resourceintensive lengthy and costly and such requirements may or may not be more rigorous than those required by the fda overall the number and scope of government regulations and requirements are increasing 

edwards lifesciences also is governed by federal state local and foreign laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety in addition edwards lifesciences is subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations including those governing the adverse impact on the environment 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states europe and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies 

reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government through the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare in response to rising medicare and medicaid costs several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for governmentfunded programs 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers increases the pressure on product pricing 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 edwards lifesciences had approximately 5600 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located at the companys headquarters in irvine california and at its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic other major concentrations of employees are located in europe japan and singapore edwards lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel and employs a very rigorous talent management system none of edwards lifesciences north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america the company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

  an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this annual report on form 10k or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of these events or circumstances occurs edwards lifesciences business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed in that case the value of edwards lifesciences securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment 

if edwards lifesciences does not introduce new products in a timely manner its products may become obsolete and its operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by new technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements edwards lifesciences products could become technologically obsolete over time in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer even if edwards lifesciences is able to develop new technologies these technologies might not be accepted quickly or at all because of the need for regulatory clearance restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice uncertainty over third party reimbursement or other factors 

moreover significant technical innovations generally require substantial time and investment before edwards lifesciences can determine the commercial viability of these innovations edwards lifesciences may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these technical innovations in addition even if edwards lifesciences is able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of its products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by edwards lifesciences competitors of products embodying newer technologies or features 

edwards lifesciences may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect its operating results 

edwards lifesciences business exposes it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices edwards lifesciences products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition some of the medical devices manufactured and sold by edwards lifesciences are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patients the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future which regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class edwards lifesciences may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges could have a material adverse impact on edwards lifesciences net income or net cash flows 

edwards lifesciences may experience supply interruptions that could harm its ability to manufacture products 

edwards lifesciences uses a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of its products edwards lifesciences heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials edwards lifesciences nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals edwards lifesciences purchases certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of its products from external suppliers in addition edwards lifesciences purchases certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements while edwards lifesciences works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability these efforts may not be successful in addition due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the fda regarding the manufacture of the companys products including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements edwards lifesciences may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if the need arises although alternative supplier options are considered and identified edwards lifesciences does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with this regulatory process a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by edwards lifesciences in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of its products or incorporate unique technology and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure certain suppliers have announced in the past that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices if edwards lifesciences is unable to obtain these raw materials or if there is a significant increase in the price of these materials or components the companys business could be harmed 

regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials that may be used in the manufacture of the companys products typically these actions include transition periods to allow companies to identify and implement alternative materials if edwards lifesciences were unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use the companys business could be harmed 

edwards lifesciences suppliers include international sources as such trade embargoes in foreign countries or in the united states could create delays or shortages that could harm the companys business 

the manufacturing of many of edwards lifesciences products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls if the company or one of its suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems edwards lifesciences business could suffer 

the manufacturing of many of edwards lifesciences products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements in addition quality is extremely important to the company its customers and its customers patients due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure however problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow protocols and procedures raw material problems or human error if these problems arise or if the company otherwise fails to meet its internal quality standards or those of the fda or other applicable regulatory body edwards lifesciences reputation could be damaged the company could become subject to a recall product liability and other costs product approvals could be delayed and the companys business could otherwise be adversely affected 

edwards lifesciences may be required to recognize charges in connection with the writedown of its investments the disposition of some of its businesses the termination of its interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons 

edwards lifesciences has investments in the equity instruments of other companies and may make similar investments in the future to the extent that the value of any of these investments declines edwards lifesciences may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment see investment impairments under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein 

at december 31 2007 edwards lifesciences had 343 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 75 million on these investments on its consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax 

in addition edwards lifesciences from time to time identifies businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of its business the company may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products or may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons if edwards lifesciences is unable to dispose of a business or product on terms it considers acceptable edwards lifesciences may voluntarily cease providing that product any of these events could result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect its results of operations 

historically edwards lifesciences has entered into interest rate swap agreements in connection with some of its indebtedness and expects that it will continue to do so from time to time in the future in the event that edwards lifesciences elects to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity it could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination which could adversely affect its results of operations 

edwards lifesciences may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

edwards lifesciences regularly reviews potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances edwards lifesciences may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances even if edwards lifesciences identifies appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates it may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into edwards lifesciences existing business and operations could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may require significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of edwards lifesciences business moreover edwards lifesciences may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results 

in addition edwards lifesciences may be required to take charges or write downs in connection with acquisitions it has made or may make in the future in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development charges which could be significant in the past edwards lifesciences has taken significant inprocess research and development charges in connection with acquisitions and may take similar charges in connection with acquisitions the company makes in the future which could adversely affect its results of operations 

future acquisitions could also require the issuance of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could adversely impact edwards lifesciences financial condition or results of operations 

external economic and political factors could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences business 

many external factors can affect edwards lifesciences profitability and financial condition such as interest rates tax rates general economic conditions and the political environment regarding healthcare in general for example an increase in interest rates in the general economy could result in an increase in edwards lifesciences borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict the ability of edwards lifesciences to access the capital markets in addition there have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators regulators and thirdparty payors to keep healthcare costs down such legislation regulatory or payor actions may result in limitations on the prices the company can charge for its products or the amounts that are reimbursable for its products 

edwards lifesciences business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because edwards lifesciences sells its products in a number of foreign countries its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally edwards lifesciences net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 55 in 2007 edwards lifesciences anticipates that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales in addition many of edwards lifesciences manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the 

united states accordingly edwards lifesciences future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs • unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging regions • trade protection measures embargoes and import or export licensing requirements • potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations • an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease • changes in the international political situation • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property substantially all of edwards lifesciences sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of edwards lifesciences foreign generated sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of edwards lifesciences foreign generated sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have had the effect of increasing edwards lifesciences reported revenues even when the volume of foreign sales has remained constant significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences reported revenues and results of operations edwards lifesciences has a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in edwards lifesciences quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause its stock price to decline 

from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect edwards lifesciences stock price regardless of its operating results in addition the market price of edwards lifesciences common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of other factors including 

• the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to edwards lifesciences and • changes in general conditions in the economy the financial markets the domestic or international political situation or the medical device industry 14 

edwards lifesciences sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of edwards lifesciences costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of edwards lifesciences common stock could fall other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include 

• announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by edwards lifesciences or its competitors • changes in edwards lifesciences expected operating expense levels or income and losses • changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts • demand for and clinical acceptance of products • changes in healthcare reimbursement policies or practices • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect edwards lifesciences operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • the timing of regulatory approvals • changes in foreign currency exchange rates • delays or problems in introducing new products • competitors introductions of new products services or technological innovations • changes in edwards lifesciences pricing policies or the pricing policies of its competitors • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other major regions in which edwards lifesciences does business • costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses • edwards lifesciences ability to expand its operations and • the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of edwards lifesciences operations edwards lifesciences faces intense competition within its industry and if edwards lifesciences does not compete effectively its business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive edwards lifesciences competes with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources than edwards lifesciences furthermore the industry is characterized by intensive development efforts and rapidly advancing technology edwards lifesciences customers consider many factors when selecting a product including product reliability clinical outcomes product availability price and services provided by the manufacturer edwards lifesciences present and future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances made by 

one or more of its current or future competitors or by alternative therapies including drug therapies market share can shift as a result of any of these factors edwards lifesciences future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies as a result the company must devote continued efforts and financial resources to bring new products to market and to maintain the competitiveness of its existing products see  businesscompetition  included herein 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on edwards lifesciences revenues and results of operations 

the healthcare industry has been consolidating and as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers has increased and may continue to increase causing downward pressure on product pricing as an example many existing and potential domestic customers for edwards lifesciences products have combined to form group purchasing organizations gpos gpos negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of gpos if edwards lifesciences is not one of the providers selected by a gpo it may be precluded from making sales to members of a gpo even if edwards lifesciences is one of the selected providers it may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further edwards lifesciences may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on its revenues and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations 

edwards lifesciences inability to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its business 

edwards lifesciences success and competitive position are dependent in part upon its proprietary intellectual property edwards lifesciences relies on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so although edwards lifesciences seeks to protect its proprietary rights through a variety of means edwards lifesciences cannot guarantee that the protective steps it has taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by edwards lifesciences in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid in addition as edwards lifesciences patents expire the company may be unsuccessful in its efforts to extend its protection through improvement patents modifications or line extensions the failure to maintain or extend edwards lifesciences patents could have a material adverse effect on the company 

edwards lifesciences also relies on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and edwards lifesciences may not have adequate remedies for such a breach in addition others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to edwards lifesciences trade secrets or proprietary information 

edwards lifesciences spends significant resources to monitor and enforce its intellectual property rights resulting from time to time in litigation intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time consuming however the companys efforts in this regard may not be successful edwards lifesciences may not be able to detect infringement and could lose its competitive position in the industry in addition competitors may design around edwards lifesciences technology or develop competing 

technologies patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which can make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or prospects 

third parties may claim edwards lifesciences is infringing their intellectual property and edwards lifesciences could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years edwards lifesciences competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally from time to time edwards lifesciences may be forced to defend itself against other claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and edwards lifesciences intellectual property litigation expenses could be significant adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject edwards lifesciences to significant liabilities to third parties or could require edwards lifesciences to seek licenses from third parties and could if such licenses are not available prevent the company from manufacturing selling or using certain of its products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive which could provide the companys competitors access to the same technologies 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require edwards lifesciences to either redesign its products or if possible negotiate licenses to conduct its business if edwards lifesciences is unable to redesign its products or obtain a license edwards lifesciences might have to exit a particular product offering 

edwards lifesciences and its customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and edwards lifesciences may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop its products to be compatible with these regulations 

the medical devices manufactured and marketed by edwards lifesciences are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities including regulations that cover the composition labeling testing clinical study manufacturing packaging and distribution of our products edwards lifesciences is required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and as a result is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation qsr requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require edwards lifesciences to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community edwards lifesciences is required to maintain certain international organization for standardization iso certifications in order to sell its products and the company undergoes periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if the company or its suppliers fail to adhere to qsr iso or similar requirements this could delay product production and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls or 

other consequences which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations or prospects 

medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in addition the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of postmarketing programs furthermore most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences business or results of operations or prospects at any time after approval of a product the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the fdas qsr requirements andor current medical device reporting regulations product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 

in recent years both the fda and foreign government regulators have increased regulation enforcement and inspections of the medical device industry and edwards lifesciences may be subject to more regulation enforcement and inspections by governmental authorities in the future whenever the fda or another foreign governmental authority concludes that edwards lifesciences is not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the fda or such other foreign governmental authority as applicable can impose fines or delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances institute proceedings to detain or seize edwards lifesciences products issue a recall impose operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against edwards lifesciences its officers or its employees and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice moreover the fda or some other foreign governmental authority can proceed to ban or request recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product manufactured or distributed by edwards lifesciences any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims and could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as previously announced in february 2007 the los angeles district office of the fda issued a warning letter to the company resulting from the fdas inspection of the companys facility in irvine california that concluded in august 2006 the warning letter related specifically to elements of the companys quality systems including complaint handling documentation and quality systems training in april 2007 the fda formally notified edwards lifesciences that the companys response to the fdas february 2007 warning letter adequately addressed their concerns the fda inspected the companys irvine facility in january 2008 to follow up on the commitments edwards made to the fda following the 2006 inspection the company is promptly addressing the issues raised in this inspection 

unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products and development could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences prospects 

the development of new products by edwards lifesciences requires extensive clinical trials and procedures such clinical trials are inherently risky and there can be no assurance that these trials or 

procedures will be successful or completed in a timely or cost effective manner failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the companys prospects in addition results from the companys clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if current results for a company product cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience the companys business could be adversely affected 

edwards lifesciences is subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of edwards lifesciences products including pericardial tissue valves are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of bovine products certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material edwards lifesciences obtains its bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia to date there have been only isolated reported cases in the united states the bovine tissue used in edwards lifesciences pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent edwards lifesciences has not experienced any significant adverse impact on its sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if third party payors decline to reimburse edwards lifesciences customers for its products or reduce reimbursement levels edwards lifesciences ability to profitably sell its products will be harmed 

edwards lifesciences sells its products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to its patients from third party payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products 

third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of edwards lifesciences products the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed hospitals or physicians may respond to such costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for edwards lifesciences products 

initiatives to limit growth of healthcare costs including price regulation are underway in several countries around the world in many countries customers are reimbursed for edwards lifesciences products under a governmentoperated insurance system under such a system the government periodically reviews 

the reimbursement levels for products if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels for edwards lifesciences products the companys product pricing may be adversely affected 

third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such third party payors or was used for an unapproved indication third party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices edwards lifesciences believes that many of its existing and future products are costeffective even though the onetime cost may be significant because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time edwards lifesciences cannot be certain whether these third party payors will recognize these cost savings or will merely focus on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if edwards lifesciences products are not considered costeffective by third party payors edwards lifesciences customers may not be reimbursed for its products 

edwards lifesciences is also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs

in addition edwards lifesciences is or may be a party to or may be otherwise responsible for pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed as applicable by edwards lifesciences such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law upon resolution of any such legal matters or other claims edwards lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves while any such charge could have a material adverse impact on edwards lifesciences net income or net cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences financial position results of operations or liquidity 

edwards lifesciences is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the united states the operations of edwards lifesciences like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing 

and sterilization processes while it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of compliance with environmental protection laws management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on edwards lifesciences financial position results of operations or liquidity

investment impairments 

in september 2005 the company recorded an 89 million charge related to the otherthantemporary impairment of its investment in sangamo the investment was written down to 37 million which represented the quoted market price of sangamos common stock at september 30 2005 

the company considered numerous facts including those described below to conclude that any impairment of the sangamo investment was temporary in nature as of the end of each of the quarters in 2003 and 2004 and the first two quarters of 2005 

• sangamos key internally established development milestones were progressing andor remained on track at each quarterend throughout 2003 and 2004 and the first two quarters of 2005 there were no changes in technology that could impair sangamos earnings potential of the investment and the technological progress supported a positive outlook the company believed that the number and scope of sangamos programs and the range of its third party collaborations and the continued success in the companys sangamorelated programs would significantly drive the value of sangamo moreover the clinical momentum was building at the end of 2004 with the anticipation of three to four phase i human trials the likely completion of one or more phase i trials with positive data and the planned announcements at major medical meetings • management of the company believed that declines in sangamos stock price were a result of certain external events and general investor sentiment of the biotechnology sector and not sangamospecific activities in addition the company recognized that historically reports of significant positive clinical outcomes had frequently resulted in a significant increase in the stock price of a biotechnology company over a relatively short time period management believed this would be the case for sangamo • throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary sangamo maintained cash and liquid investment reserves sufficient to continue to fund the ongoing development efforts for the technology for periods well in excess of one year • throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary the company had the financial ability and intent to retain this investment indefinitely sangamos technology was considered important to the development of certain of the companys next generation products and required a longterm horizon for ongoing development of new technology • sangamo is a multitechnology human therapeutics drug discovery and plant agriculture biotechnology company and has the ability to attract many different investors in addition the diversity of technology applications served to dilute the risk related to any one application failure 37 

the company expected the market price of sangamos stock to increase not only as a result of announcements of positive clinical trial results but also other operational events during the second half of 2005 sangamo announced five significant key developments regarding collaborative agreements additional funding and breakthrough technology the company expected that this concentration of positive developments could have generated a considerable increase in the stock price better recognizing the underlying value of sangamo based upon 1 the significant developments in the third quarter of 2005 which individually and in the aggregate failed to have a material impact on the quoted market price of sangamos stock 2 the continuing duration and severity of the impairment and 3 sangamos declining cash position the company concluded in september 2005 that the impairment on its investment in sangamo was otherthantemporary and therefore recognized an 89 million charge in earnings 

in 2005 the company recorded additional charges totaling 74 million related to otherthantemporary impairment of technology investments in five other unconsolidated affiliates of the total additional charge 19 million related to declines in the stock prices of two availableforsale investments the remaining charges were due to increased potential risk of certain private investees uncertain future liquidity

obligations table see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

the companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the companys accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain of the companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating the companys transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates as it relates to the company estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves rebate reserves allowances for doubtful accounts reserves for excess and obsolete inventory investments in unconsolidated affiliates workers compensation liabilities employee benefit related liabilities income taxes any impairments of assets forecasted transactions to be hedged litigation reserves and contingencies 

these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements using historical experience and all available information the company also uses outside experts where appropriate the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product provided that an agreement of sale exists the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in the case of certain products 

where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 

the companys sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted the companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on thirdparty data as certain thirdparty information was itself in the form of estimates and reflect other limitations 

the companys primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the companys united states distributors and represents the difference between the companys sales price to the distributor at the companys distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the endcustomer this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributors accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest distributors this customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates the company continually monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 

the company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations gpo and customers based upon target sales levels these volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on our customers contracted rebate programs and our historical experience of rebates paid the company continually monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated product returns are minimal because returns are not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt an allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customerspecific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as financial difficulty the allowance for doubtful accounts was 75 million and 65 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration or damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was 149 million and 132 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

patent costs 

the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications the company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability to the extent the company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in evaluating goodwill the company completes the twostep goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 142  goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 142 the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities including existing goodwill to those reporting units the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value since the adoption of sfas 142 and sfas 144 the company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 

additionally in accordance with sfas 142 and sfas 144 management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and longlived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable impairment indicators include among other conditions cash flow deficits historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates are longterm strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development certain of these investments are designated as availableforsale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 115  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as  accumulated other comprehensive income loss  gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting as appropriate the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations whereby the company owns a minimum of 5 of the investees outstanding voting stock under the equity method of accounting these investments are recorded at the amount of the companys investment and adjusted each period for the companys share of the investees income or loss and dividends paid as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investments fair value 

when the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered otherthantemporary and result in a realized loss 

• the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost • the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee • the reasons for the decline in market value • the investees performance against product development milestones and • the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value income taxes 

income taxes are determined under guidelines prescribed by sfas no 109  accounting for income taxes  sfas 109 under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings 

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating the companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes as required by the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  fin 48 the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based on technical merit if challenged 

by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort for tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot threshold the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

stockbased compensation 

on january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased awards based on estimated fair values stockbased awards consist of stock options restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period vesting period the valuation provisions of sfas 123r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified estimated compensation expense for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date are being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense adjusted for estimated forfeitures determined in the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123  accounting for stockbased compensation  sfas 123 upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units the company issues common stock the company elected the modifiedprospective method of transition under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas 109 by prescribing guidance for the recognition derecognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction fin 48 requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits be disclosed the application of fin 48 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets on january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 differences between the amounts reported as a result of adoption have been accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the january 1 2007  retained earnings  balance 

the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 was a 17 million decrease in tax reserves and increase in the january 1 2007  retained earnings  balance as of the adoption date of january 1 2007 the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was 246 million which is included in  other longterm liabilities  this liability can be reduced by 34 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amount of 212 million if recognized would favorably affect the companys effective tax rate 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties is as follows in millions 



as of december 31 2007 the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was 364 million this liability can be reduced by 80 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments state income taxes and timing adjustments the net amount of 284 million if recognized would favorably affect the companys effective tax rate 

the company recognizes interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes upon adoption of fin 48 the company had accrued 11 million net of 02 million tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions and as of december 31 2007 the company had accrued 31 million net of 11 million tax benefit of interest related to uncertain tax positions 

the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time while the company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements furthermore the company may later decide to challenge any assessments if made and may exercise its right to appeal the unrecognized tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations proposed assessments by tax authorities negotiations between tax authorities identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation regulations or case law management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions 

during the third quarter of 2007 the internal revenue service irs initiated an audit of the 2005 and 2006 tax years this audit is expected to close in late 2008 no significant unexpected adjustments have been proposed to date 

as a result of the irs and other audits the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next twelve months due to either settlement of audits or expiration of statutes of limitations quantification of those potential changes cannot be estimated at this time at december 31 2007 the company has concluded all united states federal income tax matters for years through 2004 all material state local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2002

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including currency exchange rates and interest rates the companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs 

edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps optionbased products and forward currency contracts the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes the total notional amounts of the companys derivative financial instruments at december 31 2007 and 2006 were 3362 million and 2952 million respectively the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements optionbased products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the companys exposure through its use of derivatives 

interest rate risk 

the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis there were no interest rate swaps in effect as of december 31 2007 

as part of its overall riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 39 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 of the companys weightedaverage interest rate affecting the companys financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments would have an immaterial effect on the companys annual interest expense 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and optionbased products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations optionbased products consist of purchased put options and at times written sold call options to create collars optionbased products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive or require the company to make payments at specified currency rate levels 

as part of its riskmanagement process the company uses a valueatrisk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a 14day holding period to estimate this potential loss the companys calculated var at december 31 2007 and 2006 with a maturity of up to one year was 51 million and 23 million respectively this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances the companys calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in the companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods in addition the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse which may not be the case any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures there may be currency exchangerate gains or losses in the future 

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments used by the company involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines counterparty diversification monitoring of counterparty financial condition and masternetting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december 31 2007 reduced by the effects of masternetting agreements additionally at december 31 2007 all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of aa or better by national rating agencies the company does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to nonperformance as of december 31 2007 the company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in april 2000 

concentrations of credit risk 

in the normal course of business edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses in 2007 the company had no customers that represent greater than 10 of its total net sales or accounts receivable net 

investment risk 

edwards lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies these investments are classified in  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  on the consolidated balance sheets 

as of december 31 2007 edwards lifesciences had approximately 343 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of 75 million on these investments in  accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary 

the company has recorded in  shortterm investments  cash held in the bank of america columbia strategic cash fund a private placement money market mutual fund which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in december 2007 resulting in the companys inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash the fair value of the companys investment in this fund as of december 31 2007 was estimated to be 494 million based on the net asset value of the fund as of december 31 2007 the company recognized a loss of 07 million included in  other income expense net  related to the estimated realizable value of this fund the company expects to receive cash redemptions for its remaining investment during 2008

although some of edwards lifesciences patents are due to expire within the next five years edwards lifesciences patent strategy is to file improvement patent applications and in some cases additional patent applications covering new aspects or modifications of the affected products or line 

extensions of these products as a result the duration of some of the patents covering edwards lifesciences products can extend up to 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in issued patents there can also be no assurance that pending improvement applications or additional patent applications covering new aspects or modifications of the affected products or line extensions of these products will result in issued patents edwards lifesciences management does not believe that the expiration of any one or more of its patents that are due to expire in the next five years will cause a material adverse effect on the sales of edwards lifesciences products 

edwards lifesciences is a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which it has obtained for varying terms the exclusive or nonexclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross licensing rights or royalty payments edwards lifesciences has also granted various rights in its own patents to others under license agreements competitors may challenge the validity and enforceability of or circumvent patents issued to or licensed by edwards lifesciences such patents may also be found to be insufficiently broad to provide edwards lifesciences with a competitive advantage 

edwards lifesciences actively monitors the products of its competitors for possible infringement of edwards lifesciences owned andor licensed patents litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by edwards lifesciences and the company plans to continue to defend and prosecute its rights with respect to such patents however the companys efforts in this regard may not be successful in addition patent litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort edwards lifesciences also relies upon trade secrets for protection of its confidential and proprietary information others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques and third parties may otherwise gain access to edwards lifesciences trade secrets 

the following table identifies some of the primary trademarks of edwards lifesciences that are registered in the united states patent and trademark office 

 other key trademarks owned by edwards lifesciences include 

 many of these trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and edwards lifesciences has determined it is commercially advantageous to do so 

government regulation and other matters 

regulatory approvals in the united states the food and drug administration fda has responsibility for regulating the introduction of new medical devices the fda regulates laboratory and manufacturing practices labeling and recordkeeping for medical devices and review of required 

manufacturers reports of adverse experience to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices many of the devices that edwards lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the fda has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket approval requirements the process of obtaining fda approval to market a product can be resourceintensive lengthy and costly fda review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of edwards lifesciences products any delay or acceleration experienced by edwards lifesciences in obtaining regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials or in obtaining required market clearances especially with respect to significant products in the regulatory process that have been discussed in public announcements may affect edwards lifesciences operations or the markets expectations for the timing of such events and consequently the market price for edwards lifesciences common stock the fda has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices or order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices the fda also may require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may enjoin and restrain certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations moreover the fda administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the united states and the importation of devices into the united states 

medical device laws are also in effect in countries outside of the united states where edwards lifesciences does business these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of edwards lifesciences medical device products to requests for product data or certifications the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 

edwards lifesciences is also governed by federal state local and foreign laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety in addition edwards lifesciences is subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations including those governing the adverse impact of material on the environment 

health care initiatives government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing are continuing in many countries where edwards lifesciences does business including the united states and japan as a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies although edwards lifesciences believes it is well positioned to respond to changes resulting from this worldwide trend toward cost containment proposed legislation andor changes in the marketplace could have an adverse impact on future operating results 

diagnosticrelated groups reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the united states government through the health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by medicare in response to rising medicare and medicaid costs several legislative proposals in the united states have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for these programs while edwards lifesciences has been unaware of significant domestic price resistance directly as a result of the reimbursement policies of diagnosticrelated groups changes in these reimbursement levels and processes could have an adverse effect on edwards lifesciences domestic pricing flexibility 

in keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power the medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts than in the past the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may 

also increase the pressure on product pricing although management is unable to estimate the potential impact at this time 

employees 

as of december 31 2004 edwards lifesciences had approximately 5200 employees worldwide the majority of whom were located at the companys headquarters in irvine california and at its manufacturing facilities in puerto rico and the dominican republic other major concentrations of employees are located in europe japan and brazil edwards lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation benefits equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel none of edwards lifesciences north american employees are represented by a labor union in various countries outside of north america the company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees 

risk factors 

  an investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in edwards lifesciences filings with the securities and exchange commission if any of the events described below occurs edwards lifesciences business financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the value of edwards lifesciences securities could decline and an investor may lose part or all of his or her investment 

if edwards lifesciences does not introduce new products in a timely manner its products may become obsolete and its operating results may suffer 

the cardiovascular products industry is characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements edwards lifesciences products will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer even if edwards lifesciences is able to develop new technologies these technologies may not be accepted quickly because of industry specific factors such as the need for regulatory clearance unanticipated restrictions imposed on approved indications entrenched patterns of clinical practice and uncertainty over third party reimbursement 

moreover significant technical innovations generally will require a substantial investment before edwards lifesciences can determine the commercial viability of these innovations edwards lifesciences may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these technical innovations in addition even if edwards lifesciences is able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of its products these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by edwards lifesciences competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 

edwards lifesciences may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect its operating results 

edwards lifesciences business exposes it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices edwards lifesciences products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition some of the medical devices manufactured and sold by edwards lifesciences are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time edwards lifesciences could be the subject of product liability suits alleging that component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients product liability lawsuits and claims safety alerts or product recalls in the future regardless of 

their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers 

edwards lifesciences may experience supply interruptions that could harm its ability to manufacture products 

edwards lifesciences uses a diverse and broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of its products edwards lifesciences nonimplantable products are manufactured from manmade raw materials including resins chemicals electronics and metals edwards lifesciences heart valve therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and manmade materials edwards lifesciences purchases certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of its products from external suppliers in addition edwards lifesciences purchases certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance costeffectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements edwards lifesciences works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability alternative supplier options are generally considered and identified although edwards lifesciences does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with this regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by edwards lifesciences in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of its products or incorporate unique technology management does not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract would have a material adverse effect on the company 

in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure in the past certain suppliers have announced that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices in some cases edwards lifesciences has been required to indemnify suppliers for product liability expenses in order to continue to receive materials or parts there can be no assurance that an indemnity from edwards lifesciences will be satisfactory to these suppliers in the future if edwards lifesciences is unable to obtain these raw materials or there is a significant increase in the price of materials or components its business could be harmed 

edwards lifesciences may be required to recognize additional charges in connection with the writedown of some of its investments the disposition of some of its businesses the termination of its interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons 

edwards lifesciences has made investments in the equity instruments of other companies and may make further such investments in the future to the extent that the value of any such investment declines edwards lifesciences may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment see asset impairments under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein 

in the case of some of the companies in which edwards lifesciences has invested the value of its equity securities has declined since the time of its original investment as a result edwards lifesciences may be required to recognize additional charges which could be substantial to write down its investments at december 31 2004 edwards lifesciences had approximately 206 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized losses of 45 million on these investments on its balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax 

as part of the ongoing evaluation of its various businesses and products edwards lifesciences from time to time identifies businesses or products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of its business edwards lifesciences may from time to time seek to dispose of these under performing businesses or product lines and may also seek to dispose of businesses or product lines from time to time for strategic or other business reasons if edwards lifesciences is unable to dispose of a business or product line on terms it considers acceptable edwards lifesciences may voluntarily terminate that business or cease providing that product any of these events may result in charges which could be substantial and which could adversely affect its results of operations 

edwards lifesciences has entered into interest rate swap agreements in connection with some of its indebtedness and expects that it will continue to do so from time to time in the future in the event that edwards lifesciences elects to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity it may be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination which could adversely affect its results of operations 

edwards lifesciences may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures require significant management resources and require significant charges or writedowns 

as part of edwards lifesciences growth strategy edwards lifesciences regularly reviews potential acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies services or products as well as potential strategic alliances edwards lifesciences may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances even if edwards lifesciences identifies appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates it may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms if at all in addition the process of integrating an acquired business technology service or product into edwards lifesciences existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of edwards lifesciences business moreover edwards lifesciences may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results in addition edwards lifesciences may be required to take charges or write downs in connection with acquisitions it has made or may make in the future in particular acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to inprocess research and development charges which could be significant for example approximately 81 million was charged to inprocess research and development in connection with the companys 2004 acquisition of percutaneous valve technologies inc edwards lifesciences has taken inprocess research and development charges in connection with other acquisitions and may take similar charges in connection with acquisitions the company makes in the future which charges could adversely affect its results of operations future acquisitions could also require issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets any of which could harm edwards lifesciences business 

edwards lifesciences business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

because edwards lifesciences sells its products in a number of foreign countries its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally edwards lifesciences net sales originating outside of the united states as a percentage of total net sales were 553 in 2004 edwards lifesciences anticipates that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales in addition many of edwards lifesciences manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the united states management expects to increase edwards lifesciences international sales which could expose it to greater risks associated with international sales and operations accordingly edwards lifesciences future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs • unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements • changes in foreign currency exchange rates 12 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging regions • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws • difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations • changes in the international political situation • differing labor regulations and • differing protection of intellectual property edwards lifesciences is subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

edwards lifesciences generated 553 of net sales in 2004 outside of the united states substantially all of edwards lifesciences sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies measured in local currency a substantial portion of edwards lifesciences foreign generated sales was generated in europe and primarily denominated in the euro and in japan the united states dollar value of edwards lifesciences foreign generated sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations significant decreases in the value of the united states dollar to the euro or the japanese yen have had the effect of increasing edwards lifesciences earnings even when the volume of foreign sales has remained constant significant increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen as well as other currencies could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences results of operations edwards lifesciences has a hedging program that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and cost however this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

increased interest rates could increase our borrowing costs and make it more difficult for us to access the capital markets 

from time to time edwards lifesciences may issue securities to finance acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other general corporate purposes an increase in interest rates in the general economy could result in an increase in edwards lifesciences borrowing costs for these financings as well as under any existing debt that bears interest at a floating rate and for which interest rate swaps are not in place and could otherwise restrict the ability of edwards lifesciences to access the capital markets 

fluctuations in edwards lifesciences quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to decline 

edwards lifesciences sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter a high proportion of edwards lifesciences costs are fixed due in part to significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of edwards lifesciences common stock may fall other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include 

• demand for and clinical acceptance of products • the timing and execution of customer contracts particularly large contracts that would materially affect edwards lifesciences operating results in a given quarter • the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products • changes in foreign currency exchange rates 13 

• unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products • competitors announcements of new products services or technological innovations • changes in edwards lifesciences pricing policies or the pricing policies of its competitors • increased expenses whether related to sales and marketing raw materials or supplies product development or administration • adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states and other major regions in which edwards lifesciences does business • costs related to possible acquisitions of technologies or businesses • edwards lifesciences ability to expand its operations and • the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of edwards lifesciences operations edwards lifesciences inability to protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its business 

edwards lifesciences success and competitive position are dependent in part upon its proprietary intellectual property edwards lifesciences relies on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so although edwards lifesciences seeks to protect its proprietary rights through a variety of means edwards lifesciences cannot guarantee that the protective steps it has taken are adequate to protect these rights patents issued to or licensed by edwards lifesciences in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid or not infringed by third parties competitors may also challenge edwards lifesciences patents in addition certain of edwards lifesciences patents are due to expire within the next five years and the company may be unsuccessful in its efforts to extend these patents through improvement patents modifications or line extensions the failure to maintain edwards lifesciences patents could have a material adverse effect on the company 

edwards lifesciences also relies on confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements could be breached and edwards lifesciences may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to edwards lifesciences trade secrets or proprietary information edwards lifesciences spends significant resources to monitor and enforce its intellectual property rights however edwards lifesciences may not be able to detect infringement and may lose its competitive position in the industry in addition competitors may design around edwards lifesciences technology or develop competing technologies intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position 

third parties may claim edwards lifesciences is infringing their intellectual property and edwards lifesciences could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 

during recent years edwards lifesciences competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally from time to time edwards lifesciences may be forced to defend itself against other claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others because intellectual property litigation can be costly and time consuming edwards lifesciences intellectual property litigation expenses could be significant adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject edwards lifesciences to significant liabilities to third parties could require edwards lifesciences to seek licenses from third parties and could if such licenses are not available prevent the company from 

manufacturing selling or using certain of its products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

third parties could also obtain patents that may require edwards lifesciences to either redesign its products or if possible negotiate licenses to conduct its business if edwards lifesciences is unable to redesign its products or obtain a license edwards lifesciences may have to exit a particular product offering 

edwards lifesciences faces intense competition and consolidation within its industry and if edwards lifesciences does not compete effectively its business will be harmed 

the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive edwards lifesciences competes with many companies some of which have longer operating histories better brand or name recognition and greater access to financial and other resources than edwards lifesciences furthermore the industry is characterized by intensive development efforts and rapidly advancing technology edwards lifesciences present and future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances made by one or more of its current or future competitors or by alternative therapies including drug therapies see business—competition included herein edwards lifesciences future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies 

the medical device industry has been consolidating and as a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and tend to involve more longterm contracts the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase downward pressure on product pricing in addition many existing and potential domestic customers for edwards lifesciences products have combined to form group purchasing organizations or gpos gpos negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of gpos if edwards lifesciences is not one of the providers selected by a gpo it may be precluded from making sales to members of a gpo even if edwards lifesciences is one of the selected providers it may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies further edwards lifesciences may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins business financial condition and results of operations 

edwards lifesciences and its customers are subject to various governmental regulations and edwards lifesciences may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop its products to be compatible with these regulations 

the medical devices manufactured and marketed by edwards lifesciences are subject to rigorous regulation by the us food and drug administration or fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have material adverse effects on edwards lifesciences business or results of operations in addition there can be no assurance that edwards lifesciences will be or will continue to be in compliance with applicable fda and other material regulatory requirements if the fda or some other foreign governmental authority were to conclude that edwards lifesciences was not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the fda or such other foreign governmental authority as applicable could institute proceedings to detain or seize edwards lifesciences products issue a recall impose operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against edwards lifesciences its officers or its employees 

and could recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice moreover the fda or some other foreign governmental authority could proceed to ban or request recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product manufactured or distributed by edwards lifesciences furthermore both the fda and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent and edwards lifesciences may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future 

unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products and development could have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences prospects 

the development of new products by edwards lifesciences requires extensive clinical trials and procedures there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be successful or completed in a timely or cost effective manner failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the companys prospects in addition current results from the companys clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience if current results for a company product cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience the companys business could be adversely effected 

edwards lifesciences is subject to risks arising from concerns andor regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease 

certain of edwards lifesciences products including pericardial tissue valve products are manufactured using bovine tissue concerns relating to the potential transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse commonly known as mad cow disease from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of bovine products edwards lifesciences obtains its bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia in december 2003 one case of a cow infected with bse was reported in the united states in response to this situation the us department of agriculture announced new strengthened control and surveillance measures with respect to bse to date there have been no additional reported cases in the united states the bovine tissue used in edwards lifesciences pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility edwards lifesciences has not experienced any significant adverse impact on its sales as a result of concerns regarding bse but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future 

if third party payors decline to reimburse edwards lifesciences customers for its products or reduce reimbursement levels edwards lifesciences ability to profitably sell its products will be harmed 

edwards lifesciences sells its products and technologies to hospitals doctors and other health care providers all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to its patients from third party payors such as government programs both domestic and international private insurance plans and managed care programs these third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods as determined by such third party payors or was used for an unapproved indication third party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices edwards lifesciences believes that many of its existing and future products are costeffective because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time edwards lifesciences cannot be certain whether these third party payors will recognize these cost savings or will merely focus on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies if edwards lifesciences products are not considered costeffective by third party payors edwards lifesciences customers may not be reimbursed for its products 

in addition third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services there can be no 

assurance that levels of reimbursement if any will not be decreased in the future or that future legislation regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of edwards lifesciences products in japan customers are reimbursed for edwards lifesciences products under a governmentoperated insurance system under this system the japanese government annually reviews the reimbursement levels for products the japanese government is also considering other reimbursement regulation if the japanese government decides to reduce reimbursement levels for edwards lifesciences products its product pricing may be adversely affected 

edwards lifesciences is or may be subject to lawsuits related to products or services manufactured or performed by the company 

edwards lifesciences is or may be a party to or may be otherwise responsible for pending or threatened lawsuits or other claims related to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed as applicable by the company or other matters such cases and claims may raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and may be subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law upon resolution of any pending legal matters or other claims edwards lifesciences may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves while such a charge could have a material adverse impact on edwards lifesciences net income or net cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid management believes that no such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences consolidated financial position 

edwards lifesciences may incur increased costs as a result of recent changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies 

compliance with recent changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 may result in increased accounting legal and administrative costs in particular section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules of the securities and exchange commission and the public company accounting oversight board impose new requirements with respect to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal controls the cost of complying with these new requirements could be substantial 

the market price for edwards lifesciences common stock may be volatile 

the market price of edwards lifesciences common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below as well as a number of factors including the following 

• quarterly variations in operating results as discussed above under —fluctuations in edwards lifesciences quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to decline • announcements of innovations new products strategic developments or business combinations by edwards lifesciences or its competitors • changes in edwards lifesciences expected operating expense levels or income and losses • changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts • the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to edwards lifesciences and • changes in general conditions in the economy the financial markets the domestic or international political situation or the medical device industry 17 

in addition in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect edwards lifesciences stock price regardless of its operating results 

edwards lifesciences stockholder rights plan charter and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law and the change in control provisions of the 3875 convertible senior debentures issued by edwards lifesciences could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the company 

edwards lifesciences has a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire edwards lifesciences on terms not approved in advance by its board of directors in addition delaware corporate law and edwards lifesciences charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay deter or prevent a change in control of the company or its management these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for edwards lifesciences stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions without the concurrence of its management or board of directors these provisions 

• authorize edwards lifesciences board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by its board of directors without stockholder approval with rights senior to those of common stock • provide for a staggered board of directors and threeyear terms for directors so that no more than onethird of edwards lifesciences directors could be replaced at any annual meeting • provide that directors may be removed only for cause • provide that stockholder action may be taken only at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent • provide for super majority voting requirements for some provisions of edwards lifesciences charter and • establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting edwards lifesciences is also subject to antitakeover provisions under delaware law which could also delay or prevent a change of control together these provisions of edwards lifesciences charter and bylaws delaware law and its stockholder rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices of edwards lifesciences common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of its common stock 

in addition if edwards lifesciences undergoes a change in control as defined in the indenture relating to edwards lifesciences 3875 convertible senior debentures prior to may 15 2008 the holders of the 3875 convertible senior debentures have the right at their option to require edwards lifesciences to purchase all or a portion of the debentures they hold in addition certain change in control events relating to the company may constitute or otherwise result in events of default under the companys other debt instruments or its receivables facilities which could result in borrowings outstanding and other amounts due under those debt instruments and receivables facilities becoming immediately due and payable these features of edwards lifesciences 3875 convertible senior debentures and other debt instruments and receivables facilities may also discourage a person or a group from attempting to acquire edwards lifesciences 

edwards lifesciences issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of its common stock and discourage a takeover 

edwards lifesciences board of directors is authorized to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of its stockholders edwards lifesciences board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights dividend rights preferences over its common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution liquidation or winding up and other terms in the event that edwards lifesciences issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over its common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if edwards lifesciences issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of the holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected in addition the ability of edwards lifesciences board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of its stockholders may impede a takeover of edwards lifesciences and prevent a transaction favorable to the holders of its common stock 

future sales of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of edwards lifesciences common stock and its ability to raise funds in new securities offerings 

future sales of substantial amounts of the common stock of edwards lifesciences in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of the common stock of edwards lifesciences that it may issue and could impair its ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equityrelated securities as of december 31 2004 edwards lifesciences had 

• 59438236 shares of common stock outstanding • 9883077 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of options outstanding under edwards lifesciences stock option plans with a weighted average exercise price of 2390 per share • in addition to the shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options referred to in the preceding bullet point 2872872 additional shares reserved for future issuance under stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans and • 2744238 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of edwards lifesciences outstanding 3875 convertible senior debentures no prediction can be made as to the effect if any that future issuances of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock issuances of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock

as further discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company has two securitization programs whereby certain subsidiaries in the united states and japan sell without recourse on a continuous basis an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of accounts receivable the significant benefits of the securitizations are lower cost of funds and differentiated sources of liquidity the company has been able to effectively lower its overall cost of funds as a result of the interest rate spreads it pays on these advances as opposed to borrowings under the current libor based credit facility additionally the company believes that in diversifying its funding sources the companys funding availability in the capital markets is strengthened as of december 31 2004 the company had sold a total of 904 million of trade accounts receivable and received funding of 804 million the securitization program in the united states expires on december 19 2005 and the japan securitization program expires on december 3 2005

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the companys accounting policies as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain of the companys accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in evaluating the companys transactions management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates as it relates to the company estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves rebate reserves allowances for doubtful accounts reserves for excess and obsolete inventory investments in unconsolidated affiliates workers compensation liabilities employee benefit related liabilities deferred tax asset valuation allowances any impairments of assets forecasted transactions to be hedged litigation reserves and contingencies 

these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements using historical experience and all available information the company also uses outside experts where appropriate the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 

the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered and collection is reasonably assured in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory the company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers revenue related to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value of the individual elements with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 

when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable these adjustments include estimates for charge backs rebates returns and other sales allowances these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions does not properly reflect future activity the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows could be impacted the companys estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on thirdparty data as certain thirdparty information was itself in the form of estimates and reflect other limitations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customerspecific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customerspecific circumstances such as financial difficulty the allowance for doubtful accounts was 45 million and 51 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

excess and obsolete inventory 

the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration or damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was 155 million and 85 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

patent costs 

the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications the company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable the related costs are amortized over the remaining useful lives of the patents using the straightline method such deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability to the extent the company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received 

impairment of longlived assets 

as the companys operations are comprised of one reporting unit the company reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the companys fair value to the net book value of its assets if the book value of the companys assets exceeds the companys fair value the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 

additionally management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable impairment indicators include among other conditions cash flow deficits historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates 

investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as availableforsale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 115  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss gains or losses on investments sold are 

based on the specific identification method the fair values of certain investments are based on quoted market prices for other investments various methods are used to estimate fair value including external valuations and discounted cash flows when the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss 

• the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost • the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee • the reasons for the decline in market value • the investees performance against product development milestones and • the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value income taxes 

the company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates to the extent the companys estimates differ from actual payments or assessments income tax expense is adjusted additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 16 of the consolidated financial statements 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109  accounting for income taxes  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns at december 31 2004 the company had deferred tax assets of 1305 million partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of 609 million the valuation allowance of 262 million as of december 31 2004 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain investments and the net operating loss carryforwards of certain nonunited states subsidiaries the company evaluates annually the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings 

employee stock option and stock purchase plans 

the company applies the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its fixed stock option and employee stock purchase plans in accordance with this intrinsic value method no compensation expense is recognized for these plans the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123  accounting for stock based compensation  in millions except per share amounts 

 the per share weightedaverage fair value for options granted during 2004 2003 and 2002 was 1196 1093 and 1164 respectively the fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 the pro forma expense for employee stock purchase subscriptions was calculated with the following weightedaverage assumptions for grants during the following periods 

 the expected volatility assumptions for the stock option and stock purchase plans used in the blackscholes option pricing model is estimated on the date of each grant 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2004 the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf abstract issue no 048  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  the abstract addresses when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt investments should be included in diluted earnings per share this consensus is effective for reporting periods ending after december 15 2004 adoption of this consensus did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements but may have a minimal impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in the future 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151  inventory costs—an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4  this statement amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued a revision of fasb statement no 123  accounting for stockbased compensation  this statement supersedes apb opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance this statement eliminates the alternative to use opinion 25s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in statement 123 as originally issued under opinion 25 issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost this statement requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of those awards with limited exceptions this revision is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 the company is still assessing the impact that adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements however the company believes that adoption of this standard will result in a charge to reported earnings 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the companys business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets including currency exchange rates and interest rates the companys hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on managements judgment of the appropriate tradeoff between risk opportunity and costs 

edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps optionbased products and forward currency contracts the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes the total notional amounts of the companys derivative financial instruments at december 31 2004 and 2003 were 4483 million and 5676 million respectively the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements optionbased products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the companys exposure through its use of derivatives 

interest rate risk 

the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis the companys interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate at specified intervals calculated on an agreedupon notional amount 

as part of its overall riskmanagement program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates a 54 basispoint increase in interest rates approximately 10 percent of the companys weighted average interest rate affecting the companys financial instruments including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments would have an immaterial effect on the companys annual interest expense 

currency risk 

the company is primarily exposed to currency exchangerate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro business activities in various currencies 

expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies in addition the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and optionbased products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations optionbased products consist of purchased put options and at times written sold call options to create collars optionbased products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive or require the company to make payments at specified currency rate levels 

as part of its riskmanagement process the company uses a valueatrisk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level using spot and threemonth implied volatilities as stochastic variables and correlations as of the measurement date to estimate this potential loss the companys calculated var at december 31 2004 and 2003 with a maturity of up to one year is 50 million and 30 million respectively this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances the companys calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof and changes in the companys portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods in addition the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse which may not be the case any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures there may be currency exchangerate gains or losses in the future 

credit risk 

derivative financial instruments used by the company involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines counterparty diversification monitoring of counterparty financial condition and masternetting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december 31 2004 reduced by the effects of master netting agreements additionally at december 31 2004 all derivative financial instruments based on notional amounts were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of aa or better by national rating agencies the company does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to nonperformance as of december 31 2004 the company has not experienced any counterparty default during the four years ended december 31 2004 

concentrations of credit risk 

in the normal course of business edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses which when realized have been within the range of managements allowance for doubtful accounts during all periods presented 

sales to baxter acting in the capacity of the companys distributor subsequent to the taxfree spinoff of edwards lifesciences from baxter represented approximately 8 of the companys total net sales for 2002 substantially all of these agreements had been terminated as of december 31 2002 in 2004 the company had no customers that represent greater than 10 of its total net sales or accounts receivable net 

investment risk 

edwards lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies these investments are classified in investments in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 

in 2002 the company recorded a 674 million pretax charge related to the impairment of its investment in preferred stock of worldheart the investment was written down to 62 million which represented the value of the companys preferred stock investment had it been converted into common stock at october 15 2002 the decision to record the charge was based primarily on delays in worldhearts product development timelines arising from its revised strategy a further impairment of 47 million was charged in 2004 resulting from the decline in worldhearts stock price should worldheart fail to meet certain future development and financing milestones further impairment charges may be necessary 

in addition to the investment in worldheart 15 million at december 31 2004 edwards lifesciences had approximately 191 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies at december 31 2004 the company had recorded unrealized losses of 45 million on these investments in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax management considers these declines temporary in nature based upon the individual companies operating results financial condition and achievement of product development milestones should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary

a reconciliation of the shares used in the basic and diluted per share computations is as follows in millions 

 diluted earnings per share excludes 32 million and 21 million shares related to options for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively these options were excluded because the exercise price per share was greater than the average market price resulting in an antidilutive effect on diluted earnings per share the effect of approximately 27 million common shares relating to the companys 1500 million convertible debentures due 2033 has been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 because the result is antidilutive

derivatives 

edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by volatility in interest rate and currency exchange rates derivative instruments that are used as part of the companys interest and foreign exchange rate management strategy include interest rate swaps optionbased products and forward exchange contracts as of december 31 2004 all of these derivative instruments are designated as hedges of 

underlying exposures edwards lifesciences does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the company uses interest rate swaps to convert floatingrate debt to fixedrate debt the companys interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate at specified intervals calculated on an agreedupon notional amount the debt and amounts that the company hedges are determined based on prevailing market conditions and the current shape of the yield curve interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions 

the company utilizes forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to forecasted intercompany and third party foreign currency transactions these contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates these contracts are entered into to reduce the risk that the companys earnings and cash flows resulting from certain forecasted transactions will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

derivative instruments used by edwards lifesciences involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines counterparty diversification monitoring of counterparty financial condition and international swap dealers association master netting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties all derivative financial instruments are with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of aa or better with national rating agencies 

all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value on the date that the company enters into a derivative contract it designates the derivative as either a a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or b a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction eg until periodic settlements of a variable asset or liability are recorded in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness which represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction is recorded in currentperiod earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in either currentperiod earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss depending on whether the hedging relationship satisfies the criteria for a fairvalue or cash flow hedge 

the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions the company also formally assesses both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those 

derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods all components of each derivatives gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 

when it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively a derivative ceases to be highly effective when a the company determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions b it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur c the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised or d management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 

when the company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings however if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter the gains and losses that were accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized immediately in earnings in a situation in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding the company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet recognizing changes in the fair value in currentperiod earnings 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income encompasses all changes in equity other than those arising from transactions with stockholders and consists of net income currency translation adjustments pension adjustments unrealized net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and investments in unconsolidated affiliates classified or held as availableforsale
