strategy 

the company focuses on four key longterm strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

• achieve strong longterm investment performance across distinct investment capabilities with clearly articulated investment philosophies and processes aligned with client needs 

• be instrumental to our clients success by delivering our distinctive investment capabilities worldwide to meet their needs 

• harness the power of our global platform by continuously improving execution effectiveness to enhance quality and productivity and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business and 

• perpetuate a highperformance organization by driving greater transparency accountability diversity of thought factbased decision making and execution at all levels 

as an integrated global investment manager we are keenly focused on meeting clients needs and operating effectively and efficiently we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

we believe one of invescos greatest strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm 

industry trends 

trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

• the global pandemic that began in 2020 is continuing to drive fundamental changes in the ways asset managers engage with clients manage their businesses and deliver investment outcomes many of the changes that were under way in 2020 have been meaningfully accelerated by the pandemic including efforts to further digitize the client experience using data analytics to better anticipate and understand client needs as part of providing solutionsoriented outcomes and leveraging technology to better connect with our clients and among our employees firms within and outside the industry have also had to evolve their cultures to serve and accommodate a workforce that is primarily remote 

• distribution partners are becoming more selective and continuing to maintain fewer relationships and partners reducing the number of trusted investment managers with whom they work invesco provides a robust set of capabilities and creates investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives 

• clients and distribution partners are also demanding more from investment managers while investment performance remains paramount competitive pricing client engagement and valueadded services including portfolio analytics and consultative solutions increasingly differentiate managers clients and distribution partners are also increasingly discerning and focused on greater value for their money invesco delivers competitive pricing investor education thought leadership digital platforms and other valueadded services that enhance the client experience the firm is also working to enhance the client user experience through digital marketing web mobile social and improved service 

• investors continue to demand alternative passive and smart beta strategies as a consequence the industry is seeing client demand for certain active core equities portfolios decline as a share of global flows invesco is the 3 provider of smart beta aum in the us invesco sponsors 89 etfs with greater than 500 million in assets invesco also has a strong lineup of alternative and multiasset strategies supported by ongoing product development 

• environmental social and governance esg investing has received increased attention in the asset management industry with the belief that incorporating esg into investing is essential to creating sustainable value and effectively mitigating risk invescos intention is to fully integrate esg factors over time into the investment process 

• the asset management industry is experiencing pressure on net revenue yield arising from increased use of low fee passive products and further concentration within channel distribution partners which increases their ability to negotiate pricing 

• regulatory activity remains at increased levels and is influencing competitive dynamics increased regulatory scrutiny of asset managers has focused on many areas including transparencyunbundling of fees inducements conflicts of interest capital liquidity solvency leverage operational risk management controls and compensation invesco continues to work proactively with regulators around the world to better understand and help shape the evolving 

  

  

  

regulatory landscape efforts to further modernize and strengthen our global platform will enhance our ability to compete effectively across markets while complying with the variety of applicable regulatory regimes this is a key differentiator for large scaled firms such as invesco 

• although the developed markets in the us and europe are the two largest markets for financial assets by a wide margin other key emerging markets in the world such as greater china and india are growing faster and are positioned for greater future growth over the long term in particular the chinese mutual fund management industry has grown from zero to more than 4 trillion and it is expected to become the secondlargest fund management market in the world in 2025 with more than 6 trillion in assets additionally population age differences between emerging and developed markets will result in differing investment needs and horizons among countries asset allocation and retirement savings schemes also differ substantially among countries we believe firms such as invesco with experience across a variety of key markets and diversified investment capabilities and product types are best positioned to meet clients needs in this global competitive landscape 

• technology advances are impacting core elements of the investment management industry which lags other industries in its use of technology clients increasingly seek to interact digitally with their investment portfolios this is leading to established managers investing in andor acquiring technology platforms as the investment management business becomes more complex automation will become increasingly important to serve clients effectively and efficiently invesco is leveraging technology across its business and exploring opportunities to work with thirdparty technology firms to enhance our clients investment experience in addition over the past few years invesco has made investments in its digital wealth business intelliflo 

these dynamics are driving fundamental changes within the industry and we believe will drive increasing consolidation we believe the steps we have taken over the past decade strengthened our ability to understand anticipate and meet client needs and will help ensure invesco is wellpositioned to compete within our industry over the long term 

investment management capabilities 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management approaches provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives we offer custom solutions across all asset classes and increasingly incorporate esg considerations into our investment decisions and products 

the following sets forth our major managed investment objectives by asset class

corporate responsibility and human capital 

invesco’s longterm success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talent invesco invests significantly in talent development health and welfare programs technology and other resources that support our employees in developing their full potential both personally and professionally we believe that an employee community that is diverse and inclusive engaged in community involvement and invested in employee wellbeing will drive positive outcomes for our clients and shareholders during 2021 the covid19 pandemic continued to be a worldwide public health and business phenomenon our top priority since the beginning of the pandemic has been the health and wellbeing of our worldwide employees in addition to other actions taken we continue to assess the general wellbeing of our employees and their ability to stay healthy productive and connected we regularly conduct confidential surveys of our employees to gauge their sentiment across a variety of engagement categories including questions related to compensation benefits worklife balance career development inclusion teamwork and leadership 

we believe that diversity and inclusion are both moral and business imperatives we are committed to improving diversity at all levels and in all functions across our global business as evidenced by our ceo and senior managing directors including a diversity and inclusion goal in their performance goals increasing representation of women and other underrepresented employees remains a focus for invesco as does building an inclusive environment at the end of 2021 our global workforce was 39 female and 61 male 2020 39 female and 61 male with 35 of senior managers worldwide being women 2020 33 all employees are required to take unconscious bias training our employees are also encouraged to participate in any of our eleven business resource groups where employees with diverse backgrounds experiences and perspectives can connect our business resource groups are sponsored by senior leaders and are designed by employees for employees 

as of december 31 2021 the company had 8513 employees with an ontheground presence in over 20 countries december 31 2020 8512 none of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 

the company is committed to reducing our impact on the environment we believe asset managers have a crucial role to play in supporting investment aligned with global efforts to reduce the impact of climate change on our planet we recently signed the net zero asset managers initiative joining other asset managers to support the global goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner 

  

  

  

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance fees range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and increasingly firms outside the traditional financial industry such as technology providers many of these competitors have greater financial resources and higher brand recognition than the company we believe our experience as a trusted partner to clients the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution and our commitment to innovation enable us to compete effectively in the global investment management business there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice and institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with investment managers or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and evolving our risk management approach and activities to ensure they keep pace with business change and client expectations we believe a key factor in our ability to manage through challenging market conditions and significant business change is our integrated and global approach to risk management we seek to embed risk management in our daytoday decisionmaking as well as our strategic planning process while our global risk management framework seeks to enable consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company 

our framework leverages two governance structures i our global performance and risk committee oversees the management of core investment risks and ii our corporate risk management committee oversees the management of all other business and strategyrelated risks a network of regional business unit and riskspecific management committees with oversight by the corporate risk management committee provides ongoing identification assessment management and monitoring of risks that ensures both broad as well as indepth multilayered coverage of existing and emerging risks across all domains of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to market dynamics and volatility 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy could negatively affect our revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

• in the event of extreme circumstances including economic political or business crises such as a widespread systemic failure or disruptions in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties on financial instruments we may suffer significant declines in aum and severe liquidity or valuation issues in managed investment products in which client and company assets are invested all of which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition liquidity credit ratings ability to access capital markets and ability to retain and attract key employees additionally these factors could impact our ability to realize the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets 

• illiquidity andor volatility of the global fixed income andor equity markets could negatively affect our ability to manage client inflows and outflows or to timely meet client redemption requests 

• uncertainties regarding geopolitical developments such as nation state sovereignty border disputes diplomatic developments social instability or changes in governmental policies can produce volatility in global financial markets this may impact the levels and composition of our aum and also negatively impact investor sentiment which could result in reduced or negative flows 

• changes to united states tax tariff and importexport regulations and economic sanctions may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business any changes with respect to trade policies treaties taxes government regulations and tariffs or the perception that any of these changes could occur may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global trade and in particular trade between other nations and the united states given our strong position in asia pacific and emea we could be more adversely affected than others by such market uncertainties 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios our aum as of january 31 2022 were 15509 billion we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact the market value of our aum revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among client portfolios these could be caused by investors reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which we focus investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance relative or absolute of the client portfolios we manage and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other competing products tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues which may have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain passively managed products our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

  

  

  

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields these redemptions would reduce aum thereby reducing our revenues if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav which may have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates the federal reserve has taken actions that have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time market interest rates may increase in the future and the increase may materially and negatively affect the value of the assets that we manage declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

certain changes in the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our client portfolios libor will be eliminated as a benchmark reference rate as a result of regulatory reform markets are developing replacement reference rates in response to this change the implementation of new reference rates development of liquidity in instruments adopting these new reference rates and management of any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain significant areas of focus for us and others in the marketplace it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from libor the value or profitability of liborbased instruments held in our client portfolios or products we manage that use libor as a reference rate may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new instruments and products are commercially accepted and operationally mature 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including equities fixed income products commodities derivatives other similar financial instruments real estate and other alternative investments investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments which may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 8567 million in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or japanese yen among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

risks related to investment performance and competition 

poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our aum or affect our sales and negatively impact our revenues and income 

our investment performance is critical to the success of our business strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our products poor investment performance as compared to thirdparty benchmarks or competitive products has in the past led and could in the future lead to a decrease in sales of our products and stimulate redemptions from existing products generally lowering the overall level of aum and reducing our management fees there is no assurance that past or present investment performance in our products will be indicative of future performance if we fail or appear to fail to address successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any poor investment performance we may be unsuccessful in reversing such under performance and our future business prospects would likely be negatively affected 

  

  

  

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in many products including low fee passively managed products which compete with our actively managed products 

our competitors include a large number of investment management firms and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants around the world have also resulted in increased competition industry consolidation has increased in recent years both in the area of distributors and asset managers further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future 

our competitors can increase their market share to our detriment by reducing fees the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future 

in addition technology is subject to rapid advancements and changes and our competitors may from time to time implement newer technologies or more advanced platforms for their services and products including digital advisers and other advanced electronic systems which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive 

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements new products often must be in the marketplace for three or more years in order to generate the track records required to attract significant aum inflows increasingly clients and intermediaries are looking to investment managers to be able to deliver investment outcomes tailored to particular circumstances and needs and to augment traditional investment management products and services with additional valueadded services a failure to continue to innovate and introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products irrespective of the performance of our products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

  

risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

as a result of the global market reactions to the covid19 pandemic our assets under management aum and revenues have at times been negatively impacted and we have in the past and may in the future face various potential operational challenges due to the pandemic 

as a result of the global market reactions to the covid19 pandemic our aum and revenues declined significantly during the early phases of the pandemic as governments enacted social containment measures and central banks and governments sought to enact economic relief measures while many global markets and our aum and revenues have improved materially since the early stages of the pandemic further negative market reactions may occur as a result of failures to limit infections or deaths due to the covid19 virus delays in developing andor delivering effective treatments for the virus increased infections due to new variants or vaccine hesitancy and reduced support or positive impact of central banks and government economic relief measures additional negative market reactions could further negatively impact our aum and revenues the volatility in the global markets has also adversely affected the liquidity of certain managed investment products in which client and company assets are invested 

our efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic have required and will continue to require a significant investment of time and resources across our business going forward the vast majority of employees will be working in their assigned office location at least part of the time but we expect a significant degree of remote work to continue for the foreseeable future while our teams have been successful in working remotely operational challenges may arise in the future many of the key service providers we rely on have also transitioned to working at least partially remotely if we or they were to experience material disruptions in the ability for our or their employees to work remotely eg disruption in internetbased communications systems or networks or the availability of essential goods and services our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course could be materially adversely disrupted to date our own employees and we believe the employees of our key service providers have not experienced any material degree of illness due to the covid19 virus if our or their workforces or key components thereof were to experience significant illness levels our ability to operate our business could be materially adversely disrupted further if our cyber security diligence and efforts to offset the increased risks associated with greater reliance on mobile collaborative and remote technologies during the covid19 pandemic as well as the increased frequency and sophistication of external threat actors are not effective or successful we may be at increased risk for data privacy or other cyber security incidents any such material adverse disruptions to our business operations or loss of information could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

the extent to which our business results of operations aum and financial results are further affected by the covid‐19 pandemic will largely depend on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the length of time it will take for the economy to recover along with potentially more permanent impacts on how we operate and serve our clients in addition many of the risk factors described herein may be heightened by the effects of the covid‐19 pandemic and related economic conditions 

risks related to operating our business 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled investment management and other inhigh demand personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients the market for skilled investment management professionals is highly competitive our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

  

  

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries no single intermediary is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary investment products which could limit the distribution of our products investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor one of our competitors as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future similarly particularly in the united states certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers if a material portion of our distributors were to substantially narrow their product offerings it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability more broadly in both retail and institutional channels intermediaries distribution firms and consultants are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms they do business with while this offers opportunities to the company to have broader and deeper relationships with firms that continue to do business with us it also poses risks of additional lost business if a particular firm chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with the company any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these intermediaries and the consultant community due to any of the abovedescribed factors would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in costs of correction damage awards or regulatory fines and penalties against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements such as adherence to investment restrictions or limits that we are required to observe in the provision of our services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain investment products a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements which could lead to fines and penalties against the company any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to seek to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us registered funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other funds generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason openend registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

the quantitative models we use and our index tracking investment solutions may contain errors which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

we use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and investment processes including those related to portfolio management portfolio risk analysis and client investment guidance any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation in addition we offer index tracking investment solutions for our passive products and any errors or disruptions in our ability to accurately track a subject index could materially adversely affect our business or reputation 

  

  

  

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients other market participants and regulators and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including portfolio management errors or cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of other clients or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us or the client portfolios we manage 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the client portfolios that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets such nonperformance could produce a financial loss for the company or the client portfolios we manage 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions protect the privacy of clients employees and business partners data and provide reports and provide other services to our clients 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of confidential data litigation and regulatory enforcement actions and reputational harm cyber security incidents and cyberattacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyber threats although we seek to take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and seek to continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer malware or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure data storage and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business further thirdparty service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us regarding cyber incidents 

  

  

  

a breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions including fines and penalties which could be material and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

our ability to manage and grow our business successfully can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations 

our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business depends on our ability to integrate our varied accounting financial information and operational systems on a global basis moreover adapting or developing the existing technology systems we use to meet our internal needs as well as client needs industry demands and new regulatory requirements is also critical for our business the introduction of new technologies presents new challenges to us on an ongoing basis we need to upgrade and improve our technology including our data processing financial accounting shareholder servicing and trading systems implementing any such upgrades updates or other changes or replacements for our systems may be expensive and timeconsuming could divert management’s focus away from core business activities and may adversely affect our business if additional or unanticipated time or resources are necessary to complete any such changes to our systems if such changed systems do not operate as anticipated or if other unforeseen issues arise in connection with any such changes to our systems further we also must be proactive and prepared to implement new technology when growth opportunities present themselves whether as a result of a business acquisition or rapidly increasing business activities in particular markets or regions these needs could present operational issues or require significant capital spending and may require us to reevaluate the current value andor expected useful lives of the technology we use which could negatively impact our results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size multiple office locations and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations further as we maintain certain business processes in lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster a disaster that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

  

  

  

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate clients or distributors and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers and their related technology systems and platforms certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions due to a failure of a thirdparty service provider or other key vendor could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

risks related to accounting capital management and liquidity 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing goodwill and intangible assets totaled 88825 million and 72280 million respectively at december 31 2021 we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant could result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

we issued perpetual preferred stock having a value of approximately 4 billion which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and may limit our ability to fund other priorities 

invesco issued approximately 4 billion of 59 fixed rate perpetual preferred stock this issuance may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of common shares in certain circumstances may increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions and will require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to make required dividend payments to preferred shareholders 

  

  

  

failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause our aum liquidity and earnings to decline as well as harm our prospects for growth 

our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including our creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force us to revise existing strategic and business initiatives our access to equity and debt markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in our long or shortterm credit ratings or changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds andor financing may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline curtail our operations and limit or impede our prospects for growth 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’ earnings and business or regulatory considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements and we maintain capital within this european subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences as of december 31 2021 our minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7249 million complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd 

risks related to strategic transactions 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime engage in strategic transactions some of which may be material strategic transactions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of a strategic transaction we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

risks related to our significant shareholders 

we have two significant shareholders of our common stock if these shareholders decide to sell these common shares in the future it could adversely impact our trading price 

we issued approximately 819 million common shares in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds most of which are held by massachusetts mutual life insurance company massmutual which currently owns approximately 16 of our outstanding common stock massmutual may in the future sell these common shares in the open market or through secondary offerings trian partners also holds a large position in our common stock owning approximately 99 of our outstanding common shares as of december 31 2021 if either massmutual or trian were to sell its equity stake in invesco or express an intention to sell the stake that action could have a significant impact on our common share trading price 

  

  

  

massmutual has the ability to significantly influence our business and massmutual’s interest in our business may be different from that of other shareholders 

massmutual is entitled to designate an individual to serve on our board so long as it beneficially owns at least i 10 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock or ii x 5 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and y 20 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our series a preferred shares additionally we are not permitted to take certain actions without the prior written approval of massmutual including making certain changes in our capital structure or our organizational documents adopting a shareholder rights plan or effectuating certain business combination transactions massmutual’s level of ownership and influence may make some transactions such as those involving mergers material share issuances or changes in control more difficult or impossible without the support of massmutual which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock the interests of massmutual may conflict with the interests of other shareholders 

risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in most countries and any enforcement action or significant changes in the laws or regulations governing our business or any firm specific regulatory or enforcement actions could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost every country in which we conduct business the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and we have seen a significant increase in regulatory changes actions and scrutiny in recent years without limiting the generality of the foregoing regulators in the united states and other jurisdictions have taken and can be expected to continue to take a more aggressive posture on bringing enforcement proceedings laws and regulations generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities’ broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to require registration or licenses limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements or actions which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business delay or deny approval for new products or service offerings cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or services impair the investment performance of other products or services impact product mix increase compliance costs andor impose additional capital requirements our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees further regulators across borders could coordinate actions against us as issues arise resulting in impacts on our business in multiple jurisdictions judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our aum results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodity future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa the department of labor dol and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom and the securities and futures commission of hong kong sfc subsidiaries operating in the european union eu are subject to various eu directives which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the uk and the eu in particular have promulgated or are considering various new or revised regulatory measures pertaining to financial services including investment managers such measures are progressing at various stages such measures in the eu generally have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states 

regulatory developments and changes specific to our business will or may include without limitation 

• regulations pertaining to the privacy and use security transfer and management of personal data with respect to clients employees and business partners the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe strengthens privacy rules for individuals in europe granting individuals more rights and control over the use of their personal information by organizations doing business with them and greatly increased penalties for noncompliance across the globe there is ongoing change to update and strengthen privacy regulations at a state level in the us and in various other jurisdictions we operate in addition new or updated rules and requirements were introduced in 2021 on international transfers of personal data such the updated eu standard contractual clauses scc’s and china’s 

  

  

  

personal information protection law pipl that create additional complexity for global organizations managing personal data within these legal frameworks 

• an increased focus on liquidity in funds including fixed income funds an example of which is the sec’s rules with respect to liquidity and liquidity risk management applicable to certain types of registered us funds or the recent studies of global and eu regulators on the resilience of investment funds during the covid19 related market turmoil 

• an increased focus on the use of leverage by funds in particular leverage attained through derivatives an example of which is the sec’s new rules with respect to the use of derivatives and derivatives risk management programs applicable to certain types of registered us funds new regulations in this area could negatively impact our existing products that employ leverage or derivatives and could impede our ability to bring new products to market 

• eu and uk regulations pertaining to integrating environmental social and governance esg topics have materially impacted the asset management industry in eu member states and in the uk for example the eu’s recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate esg into the financial system including such areas as mifid ii ucits and aifmd regulations through the integration of esg risks and new esg disclosure obligations we expect the sec and other regulators in the us to pursue similar initiatives 

• requirements pertaining to the trading of securities and other financial instruments such as swaps and other derivatives including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and european market infrastructure regulation these include significant reporting requirements designated trading venues mandated central clearing arrangements restrictions on proprietary trading by certain financial institutions other conduct requirements and potentially new taxes or similar fees 

• limitations on holdings of certain physical commodity futures contracts and other physical commodity related derivatives positions under regulations of the cftc which could result in capacity constraints for our products that employ physical commodities as part of their investment strategy 

• regulations impacting the standard of care that financial intermediaries providing investment recommendations owe to retail investors under the sec’s regulation best interest and retirement plans and accountholders under the dol’s erisa fiduciary investment advice rules 

• increased requirements to provide regulators and investors more granular detail regarding our products and services including the sec’s reporting modernization rule applicable to certain types of registered us funds required reporting to the sec cftc and nfa regarding certain of our products on forms pf and cpopqr respectively and mifid ii trade and transaction reporting in the uk and the eu 

• enhanced licensing and qualification requirements for key personnel including the united kingdom senior managers and certification regime and the hong kong sfcs managerincharge regime 

• strengthening standards regarding various ethical matters including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and antimoneylaundering laws and regulations 

• regulations promulgated to address risks of fraud malfeasance or other adverse consequences stemming from cyberattacks and ensure the digital operational resilience of firms 

• regulations promulgated to address perceptions that the asset management industry or certain of its entities or activities pose systematic risks to the financial system 

• the application of antitrust and similar competition laws to the asset management industry including proposed amendments to the us hartscottrodino act that could require investment managers to make numerous premerger notification filings with the us federal trade commission and department of justice and the potential for antitrust regulators to limit common ownership of competitive companies by a single fund or affiliated funds these developments in the application of antitrust and competition laws to our business could impede our ability to provide certain products or limit the aum of certain investment strategies that we provide 

• guidelines regarding the structure and components of fund manager compensation and other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements certain provisions impose additional disclosure burdens on public companies certain proposals could impose requirements for more widespread disclosures of compensation to highlypaid individuals depending upon the scope of any such requirements invesco could be disadvantaged in retaining key employees visàvis private companies including hedge fund sponsors 

• other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over invesco 

  

  

  

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or possible enforcement proceedings on our business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20  commitments and contingencies for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are involved in much of the coordinated activity including the publication of detailed proposals for global antibase erosion globe rules intended to ensure large multinational enterprise groups pay a 15 minimum level of tax on a jurisdictional basis 

we continually assess the impact of various us federal state and foreign legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties which could result in a material increase in our us federal state or foreign taxes we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if unfavorable legislation were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing the cost of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future financial condition and liquidity 

in addition changes in individual and corporate income tax rates including the capital gains and dividend tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products less favorably and reduce investor demand for products and services we offer which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to bo th income and nonincome based taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which are subject to current and potentially future tax audits the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities periodically due to changes in interpretations of tax laws status of tax authority examinations and new regulatory or judicial guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

  

  

  

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director’s duties to that company the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our third amended and restated byelaws byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

  

  

  

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

• we are prohibited from engaging under certain circumstances in a business combination as defined in our byelaws with any interested shareholder as defined in our byelaws for three years following the date that the shareholder became an interested shareholder 

• our board of directors without further shareholder action is permitted by our byelaws to issue preference shares in one or more series and determine by resolution any designations preferences qualifications privileges limitations restrictions or special or relative rights of an additional series the rights of preferred shareholders may supersede the rights of common shareholders 

• shareholders may only remove directors for “cause” defined in our byelaws to mean willful misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious to the company fraud or embezzlement or a conviction of or a plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to a felony 

• our board of directors is authorized to expand its size and fill vacancies and 

• shareholders cannot act by written consent unless the consent is unanimous 

general risk factors 

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3stable bbbstable and astable from moodys investor services moodys standard  poors ratings service sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to access additional financing management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

  

  

  

insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from loss or liability 

we face the inherent risk of loss or liability related to claims from clients thirdparty vendors or others actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with operations failures which could include cyber incidents to help protect against these risks we purchase insurance in amounts and against potential losses and liabilities that we consider appropriate where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable there can be no assurance however that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or if covered will not exceed coverage limits or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured and may increase significantly over relatively short periods in addition certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or coinsurance liability

the company’s financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the us dollar as discussed in the “results of operations” section below 

invesco benefits from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of aum one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographic diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

update on significant events and transactions 

we remain highly focused on our capital management and believe we are making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility our credit facility balance was zero as of december 31 2021 consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile we fully settled our remaining forward contracts liability of 309 million in the first half of 2021 we renegotiated our 15 billion credit facility extending the maturity date to april 26 2026 under favorable terms and conditions as a result of our progress the board approved a 10 increase in our dividend to 017 per share in the second quarter of 2021 we remain committed to a sustainable dividend policy and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases on january 25 2022 the company announced its intention to repurchase up to 200 million in common stock in the first quarter of 2022 subject to market conditions 

  

  

  

as previously disclosed by the company in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company identified an accounting matter related to certain oppenheimerfunds funds’ financial statements and in 2020 recorded an estimated liability related to the matter in 2021 the company reduced the estimated liability to 2543 million which resulted in a benefit of 1311 million recorded in transaction integration and restructuring expense during the fourth quarter of 2021 invesco paid 2543 million in fund shareholder reimbursements to complete remediation of this matter also in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company received an insurance recovery of 1000 million related to the matter which is reflected as a benefit to transaction integration and restructuring expense see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20 commitments and contingencies for additional details regarding the accounting matter 

as previously disclosed we have undertaken a strategic evaluation of our business focusing on four key areas of our expense base our organizational model our real estate footprint management of third party spend and technology and operations efficiency through this evaluation we have invested and will continue to invest in key areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan including etfs fixed income china solutions alternatives and global equities which has had a positive impact on the results for the year this helped us achieve six straight quarters of net longterm inflows across a variety of products 

while investing in key areas of growth we plan to create permanent annual net operating expense improvements of 200 million a significant element of the savings will be generated from realigning our workforce to support key areas of growth as well as repositioning some of our workforce to lower cost locations we have exceeded our cumulative 2021 targeted savings of 150 million in 2021 we realized 137 million in annualized savings which when combined with the 30 million in annualized savings realized in 2020 results in 167 million or 84 of our 200 million net savings expectation the remainder of our net savings is expected to be realized by the end of 2022 remaining restructuring costs related to the strategic evaluation are estimated to be in a range of 30 million to 55 million through the end of 2022 with nearly 220 million incurred since we began the strategic evaluation 

in april 2021 we announced plans to transition to state street’s alpha platform an asset servicing platform that will integrate front middle and back office investment services the migration to alpha is expected to simplify invesco’s investment infrastructure to improve scale reduce risk and improve operating efficiency allowing invesco to create a global operating model that will standardize and streamline its investment operations the integration began in the second quarter of 2021 with completion scheduled in 2024

other external factors impacting invesco 

invesco similar to the broader industry is transitioning its corporate and investment exposure away from libor to alternative riskfree rates according to regulator and working group defined timelines and guidance invesco continues to actively monitor its portfolios holding libor based instruments and strategies utilizing libor as a benchmark andor performance target and remediate as necessary 

regarding operational readiness invesco has implemented a number of process and system enhancements to support the remediation of legacy libor instruments as well as trading of new alternative reference ratelinked instruments invesco continues to engage external service providers and technology vendors to validate whether they can support transition activities and requirements including processing of fallback language following the applicable libor cessation dates invesco continues to monitor overall industry transition progress and completes ongoing analysis of the suitability of alternative riskfree rates in executing invesco’s libor transition plan despite invesco’s preparations the discontinuance of libor may adversely affect the amount of interest or other amounts payable or receivable on certain portfolio investments these changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of consolidated investment products 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various retail mutual funds and similar entities private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products the company is required to consolidate certain of these managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1 accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10k report as consolidated investments products cip the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures among other adjustments see schedule of nongaap information for additional information regarding these adjustments the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

• results of operations year ended december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 

• schedule of nongaap information 

• balance sheet discussion and 

• liquidity and capital resources 

to assess the impact of cip on the companys results of operations and balance sheet discussion refer to part ii item 8 financial statements note 21 consolidated investment products the impact on the companys results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 was a reduction of 424 million this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products

investment capabilities performance overview 

invescos first strategic objective is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients  the table below presents the one three five and tenyear performance of our actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and aum in the top half of peer group 1  



 

1 excludes passive products closedend funds private equity limited partnerships nondiscretionary funds unit investment trusts fund of funds with component funds managed by invesco stable value building block funds and cdos certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data had these been available results may have been different these results are preliminary and subject to revision 

aum measured in the one three five and ten year quartile rankings represents 48 47 46 and 42 of total invesco aum respectively and aum measured versus benchmark on a one three five and ten year basis represents 59 57 55 and 50 of total invesco aum as of december 31 2021 peer group rankings are sourced from a widelyused third party ranking agency in each fund’s market eg morningstar ia lipper evestment mercer galaxy sitca value research and assetweighted in usd rankings are as of prior quarterend for most institutional products and prior monthend for australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties rankings are calculated against all funds in each peer group rankings for the primary share class of the most representative fund in each composite are applied to all products within each composite performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor’s experience 

2 numbers in parenthesis reflect aum for each investment product see note 1 above for exclusions as a percentage of the total aum for the 5 year peer group 7433 billion 

assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum include indexbased etfs unit investment trusts uits nonmanagement fee earning aum and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

nonmanagement fee earning aum includes nonmanagement fee earning etfs uit and product leverage the net flows in nonmanagement fee earning aum can be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

  

  

  

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to certain aum as longterm longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity we present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

changes in aum were as follows 



 

1 the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds business on may 24 2019 added 2244 billion in aum at that date 

2 gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum excluding invesco great wall aum the average aum for invesco great wall was 840 billion in 2021 2020 500 billion 2019 356 billion it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of invesco great wall for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum because the revenues resulting from these aum are not presented in our operating revenues under us gaap our share of the net income of invesco great wall fund management company “invesco great wall” is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure additionally the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from cip however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company’s effective fee rate from aum 

3 net revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average aum see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues 

  

  

  

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

average aum during the year ended december 31 2021 were 14999 billion comp ared to 11949 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 

market returns 

market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period the table in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis summarizes returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

foreign exchange rates 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we experienced decreases in aum of 63 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates december 31 2020 aum increased by 103 billion 

revenue yield 

changes in our aum mix significantly impact our net revenue yield passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes and changes in the mix of products therefore have an impact on our net revenue yield at the industry level investors continue to shift towards passive products and away from active and invesco is wellpositioned to respond to this trend due to the breadth strength and diversified nature of our business in addition as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the us changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of us dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields 

i n the year ended december 31 2021 the net revenue yield was 351 basis points compared to 377 basis points in the year ended december 31 2020 a decrease of 26 basis points 

during 2021 net revenue yield continued to decline as a result of client demanddriven shifts in the aum mix towards passive lowerfee products which generally have lower fees than active products in the year ended december 31 2021 the net revenue yield on passive aum was 123 basis points compared to 448 basis points on active aum 

at december 31 2021 passive aum were 5284 billion representing 328 of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2020 passive aum were 3706 billion representing 275 of our total aum at that date 

passive aum includes our qqq etf for which we do not receive a management fee but which delivers significant marketing and brand value and increases invesco’s footprint leadership and relevance in the etf market at december 31 2021 the qqq fund represented 2149 billion or 407 of passive aum and 133 of total aum at december 31 2020 the qqq fund represented 1525 billion or 411 of passive aum and 113 of total aum 

despite the growth in our qqq etf the net revenue yield on passive aum increased from 120 basis points for the year ended december 31 2020 to 123 basis points for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 03 basis points we saw a greater proportion of inflows into relatively higher fee passive products 

at december 31 2021 active aum were 10825 billion representing 672 of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2020 active aum were 9793 billion representing 725 of our total aum at that date we also saw a greater proportion of inflows into fixed income and relatively lower fee active products these changes have decreased the net revenue yield on active aum from 464 basis points for the year ended december 31 2020 to 448 basis points for the year ended december 31 2021 

  

  

  

also contributing to the decline in net revenue yield were the higher discretionary money market fee waivers as mentioned in note 1 accounting policies which negatively impacts net revenue yield on active aum the changes described above have adversely impacted our revenue and resulting revenue yields and we expect they will continue to pressure revenues and yields in the near term 

changes in our aum by channel asset class and client domicile and average aum by asset class are presented below

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



 

1 total revenue adjustments include investment management service and distribution and other revenues that are passed through and equal the same amount as the third party distribution service and advisory expenses 

2 net revenues are operating revenues less revenue adjustments plus net revenues from invesco great wall plus management and performance fees earned from cip see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating revenues by 876 million equivalent to 13 of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to the year ended december 31 2020 132 million increase in 2020 or 02 of 2020 total operating revenues 

additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period 

investment management fees 

investment management fees increased by 5449 million 122 in the year ended december 31 2021 to 49959 million year ended december 31 2020 44510 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by 758 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 after allowing for foreign exchange movements investment management fees increased by 4691 million 105 as a result of a 255 increase in average aum partially offset by lower revenue yields when compared to the 2020 period net revenue yield has declined as a result of shifts in the aum mix towards passive lowerfee products additionally higher discretionary money market fee waivers adversely impacted the net revenue yield on active aum 

see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the impact of changes in aum on management fee yields 

  

  

  

service and distribution fees 

in the year ended december 31 2021 service and distribution fees increased by 1774 million 125 to 15964 million year ended december 31 2020 14190 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased service and distribution fees by 113 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 after allowing for foreign exchange movements service and distribution fees increased by 1661 million the total increase is driven by higher distribution fees of 877 million transfer agency fees of 436 million and administrative fees of 327 million the increase is primarily driven by higher aum to which these fees apply 

performance fees 

of our 16109 billion in aum at december 31 2021 approximately 622 billion or 39 could potentially earn performance fees including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts of our 13499 billion in aum at december 31 2020 approximately 591 billion or 44 could potentially earn performance fees including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts 

in the year ended december 31 2021 performance fees decreased by 95 million 145 to 561 million year ended december 31 2020 656 million performance fees in 2021 were primarily generated from real estate institutional products and various institutional mandates in japan performance fees in 2020 were primarily generated from real estate fixed income uk closed end funds and institutional products 

other revenues 

in the year ended december 31 2021 other revenues increased by 361 million 172 to 2461 million year ended december 31 2020 2100 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased other revenues by 05 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in other revenues was primarily driven by increases in front end fees of 293 million and real estate transaction fees of 42 million 

invesco great wall 

the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture management believes that the revenues from invesco great wall should be added to total operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that invesco great wall is making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

management reflects 100 of invesco great wall in its net revenues and adjusted operating expenses the company’s nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the 51 noncontrolling interest 

net revenues from invesco great wall were 4735 million and average aum was 840 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 net revenues were 2632 million and average aum was 500 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact of foreign exchange rate movements for the year ended december 31 2021 increased net revenues from invesco great wall by 296 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 after allowing for foreign exchange movements net revenues from invesco great wall were 4439 million the increase in revenue is a result of higher aum and improved net revenue yield on invesco great wall 

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

  

  

  

management and performance fees earned from cip increased by 26 million to 424 million in the year ended december 31 2021 year ended december 31 2020 398 million the increase is due to increased management fees earned from newly launched retail funds and clos 

operating expenses 

the main categories of operating expenses and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows 



the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense 



 

1 in prior periods amortization of intangible assets was included in the transaction integration and restructuring line item beginning in 2021 amortization of intangible assets is presented on a separate line item there is no impact on operating expenses operating income or net income 

during the year ended december 31 2021 operating expenses decreased by 1189 million 23 to 51063 million year ended december 31 2020 52252 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating expenses by 795 million or 16 of total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

  

  

  

thirdparty distribution service and advisory 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include periodic “renewal” commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for the continuing oversight of their clients assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value and apply to much of the companys nonus retail operations as discussed above the revenues from the company’s us retail operations include 12b1 distribution fees which are largely passed through to brokers who sell the funds as thirdparty distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying aum of the brokers clients thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the upfront distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client common share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting these costs are reimbursed by the related funds 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased by 2017 million 104 in the year ended december 31 2021 to 21493 million year ended december 31 2020 19476 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased thirdparty costs by 241 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in costs was 1776 million included are increases of 994 million in service fees primarily 12b1 and transfer agent fees 299 million in unitary and fund expenses 246 million in transaction fees 113 million in asset and sales based fees 108 million in front end load commissions and 56 million in renewal commissions partially offset by a decrease in sales commissions of 60 million the increase is primarily driven by higher average aum partially offset by changes in aum mix as discussed above see schedule of nongaap information for additional disclosures

other income and expenses 

the main categories of other income and expenses and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows 



equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by 796 million 1095 to 1523 million in the year ended december 31 2021 year ended december 31 2020 727 million the increase is primarily driven by increases of 503 million in our joint venture investment in invesco great wall due to increased revenues as discussed above 172 million in private equity investments and 90 million in real estate investments 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 346 million 268 to 947 million in the year ended december 31 2021 year ended december 31 2020 1293 million the decrease is primarily driven by the settlement of the forward contracts in the second quarter of 2021

included in other gainslosses of cip net are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip in the year ended december 31 2021 other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of 3900 million as compared to a net gain of 321 million in the year ended december 31 2020 the net gain during 2021 was attributable to marketdriven gains of investments held by consolidated funds 

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2021 resulted in no net change in net income attributable to invesco ltd year ended december 31 2020 94 million net increase 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of nonclo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per common share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders similarly any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos offsetting in other gainslosses of cip and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per common share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate aum 

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes incomelosses of cip however the companys operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under us gaap as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation therefore foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 geographic information in which cip has been eliminated may not correlate 

total us income before taxes increased 12437 million during the year ended december 31 2021 to 20895 million from 8458 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and includes us income of cip of 2830 million december 31 2020 401 million us income from cip increased 2429 million 6057 from 2020 primarily due to the impact of gains on consolidated partnerships excluding cip us income before taxes in 2021 increased 10008 million 1242 from december 31 2020 due to a larger increase in us operating revenues than operating expenses 

total foreign income before taxes increased 1877 million during the year ended december 31 2021 to 4110 million from 2233 million during the year ended december 31 2020 and includes foreign income of cip of 566 million december 31 2020 foreign income of cip of 152 million foreign income from cip increased 414 million 2724 from 2020 primarily due to greater net gains on consolidated retail products excluding cip foreign income increased by 1463 million 703 from 2020 due to a larger increase in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses

schedule of nongaap information 

we utilize the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and adjusted diluted earnings per common share eps the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors these measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income operating margin net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to a nongaap basis of net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation adjusted diluted eps these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any us gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates notes to the reconciliations follow the tables 

reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues 



reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income 



  

  

  

reconciliation of net income attributable to invesco ltd to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd 



 

 operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues 

 adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues 

 adjusted diluted eps is equal to adju sted net income attributable to invesco ltd divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding there is no difference between the calculated earnings per common share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per common share amounts under the two class method 

1 invesco great wall 

management reflects 100 of invesco great wall in its net revenues and adjusted operating expenses the company’s nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

2 revenue adjustments 

management believes that adjustments to investment management fees service and distribution fees and other revenues from operating revenues appropriately reflect these revenues as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these adjustments vary by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

investment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fundrelated costs other is primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties while the terms used for these types of adjustments vary by geography they are all costs that are driven by the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these revenues and expenses gross under us gaap on the consolidated statements of income 

  

  

  

3 cip 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 21 “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

during the year ended december 31 2021 management fees earned from cip that were eliminated upon consolidation were 424 million 2020 398 million 2019 335 million there were no performance fees earned from cip that were eliminated upon consolidation during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 2019 

  

4 transaction integration and restructuring related adjustments 

the transaction integration and restructuring charges reflect legal regulatory advisory valuation and other professional services or consulting fees and travel costs related to a business combination transaction or restructuring initiatives related to changes in the scope of the business or manner in which the business is conducted also included in these charges are severancerelated expenses and any contract termination costs associated with these efforts additionally these charges reflect the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction or initiative including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings following a business combination or restructuring initiative 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and restructuring related charges see results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020  transaction integration and restructuring for additional details 

5 amortization of intangible assets 

in prior periods amortization of intangible assets was included in the transaction integration and restructuring line item beginning in 2021 amortization of intangible assets is presented on a separate line item there is no impact on operating expenses operating income or net income 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements to remove amortization expense related to acquired assets and to reflect the tax benefit realized on the tax amortization of goodwill finitelived intangibles and indefinitelived intangible assets in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisitionrelated charges 

  

  

  

6 market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities 

certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically managed by the company invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through total return swap financial instruments us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation depreciation are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares or swaps will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

see below for a reconciliation of deferred compensation related items 



  

  

  

7 other reconciling items 

each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 



 

a the company recorded a charge of 1053 million in the second quarter of 2020 due to a previously disclosed sp 500 equal weight funds rebalancing correction due to the unique character and magnitude of this item it has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures  

b included within other gains and losses net for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 is the marktomarket of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterlingus dollar the pound sterling contracts provided coverage through june 30 2020 the adjustment from us gaap to nongaap earnings removes the impact of market volatility therefore the companys nongaap results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period 

c adjustment represents the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities for the acquired investment management contracts from deutsche bank and the companys digital wealth acquisitions made in 2019 

d the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a tax b enefit of 90 million resulting from the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations this benefit has been removed from the company’s nongaap results to be consistent with the exclusion of the original provision in a prior period

liquidity and capital resources 

our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements

other items 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements and we maintain capital within this european subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2021 the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7249 million december 31 2020 7636 million the decrease was driven by a reduction in net capital requirements in the uk as a result of lower expenses and aum levels as well as the weakening of the pound sterling against the us dollar the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 10883 million at december 31 2021 december 31 2020 10348 million

the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments common share repurchases capital expenditures and ongoing operating expenses is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include in no particular order of priority reinvestment in the business maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our investors through share repurchases and moderate growth of dividends 

the following table represents a reconciliation of the cash flow information presented on a us gaap basis to the cash flow information excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated investment products for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table 



 

1 these tables include nongaap presentations cash held by cip is not available for use by invesco additionally there is no recourse to invesco for cip debt the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions policyholder assets and liabilities are equal and offsetting and have no impact on invesco’s shareholder’s equity the impact of cash inflowsoutflows from policyholder assets and liabilities are reflected within cash flows from operating activities as changes in receivables andor payables as applicable 

2 restricted cash of 1292 million as of december 31 2020 is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets there was no restricted cash as of december 31 2021 or 2019 

operating activities 

operating cash flows include the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities although some receipts and payments are seasonal particularly bonus payments which are paid out during the first quarter in general after allowing for the change in cash held by cip and investment activities our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income

the carrying value of our debt at december 31 2021 was 20851 million december 31 2020 20826 million and was comprised of the following 



 

1 on april 26 2021 invesco ltd and its indirect subsidiary invesco finance plc amended and restated the 15 billion floating rate credit facility extending the expiration date from august 11 2022 to april 26 2026 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the companys weighted average cost of debt was 395 year ended december 31 2020 377 

financial covenants under the credit facility agreement include i the quarterly maintenance of an adjusted debtebitda leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility agreement of not greater than 325100 ii an interest coverage ratio ebitda as defined in the credit facility agreementinterest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination of not less than 400100  as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with our financial covenants  at december 31 2021 our leverage ratio w as 079100 december 31 2020 137100 and our interest coverage ratio was 2521100 december 31 2020 1183100 

  

  

  

the december 31 2021 and 2020 coverage ratio calculations are as follows 



 

1 adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments as defined in our credit facility may also include noncash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures 

2 unusual or otherwise nonrecurring gains and losses as defined in our credit facility are adjusted for in the determination of ebitda the benefit to expense related to the change in the oppenheimerfunds acquisition related liability and the related insurance recovery are considered unusual and have been deducted in the determination of ebitda 

3 ebitda and adjusted debt are nongaap financial measures that are used by management in connection with certain debt covenant calculations under our credit facility agreement the calculation of ebitda above a reconciliation from net income attributable to invesco ltd is defined by our credit facility agreement and therefore net income attributable to invesco ltd is the most appropriate gaap measure from which to reconcile to ebitda the calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals debt of 20851 million plus 30 million in letters of credit less 200 million of excess unrestricted cash cash and cash equivalents less the minimum regulatory capital requirement not to exceed 200 million 

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

  

  

  

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions as of december 31 2021 our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is 18964 million see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 3 fair value of assets and liabilities for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 20851 million in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 “commitments and contingencies” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future the discussion below provides information on the significant judgments and assumptions applied in each area and should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies footnote previously referenced 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2021 and 2020 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeded its carrying value during our annual impairment test in 2021 and 2020 management performed the optional qualitative approach which indicated that a quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary due to the decline in our assets under management resulting from covid19 management also performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of 2020 which indicated no impairment the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 88825 million and 89163 million at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related effective fee rates 

  

  

  

when management utilizes the option to first assess goodwill impairment on a qualitative basis the sum of certain events and circumstances is assessed to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance of the company and or significant changes in share price if the qualitative assessment indicates that an impairment may be likely or management elected to not perform the qualitative assessment management performs a quantitative test to determine the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates projected effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates 

the quantitative test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains or losses and net longterm flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the aum growth rate fee rates operating expense and the discount rate to determine present value the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis similar to goodwill management has the option to first assess indefinitelived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset in addition managements judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 629 million 625 million and 527 million for the years end ed december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if a quantitative assessment is required the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if required fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix projected effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most sensitive of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate fee rates operating expense and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions during 2021 and 2020 our annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required due to the decline in our aum resulting from covid19 management also performed a quantitative impairment test on certain indefinitelived intangible assets in the first quarter of 2020 which indicated no impairment 

income taxes 

the company files us federal state and numerous foreign income tax returns the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities significant judgment is required in the determination of our annual income tax provision which includes the assessment of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions as well as the interpretation and application of existing and newly enacted tax laws regulation changes and new judicial rulings therefore it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to changes in the interpretation of applicable guidance or as a result of examinations by taxing authorities 

  

  

  

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers all available evidence which includes the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability and the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

in the assessment of uncertain tax positions significant judgment is required to estimate the range of possible outcomes and determine the probability on a more likely than not basis of favorable or unfavorable outcomes upon ultimate settlement of an issue changes in estimate of uncertain tax positions occur periodically due to changes in interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations by tax authorities and new regulatory or judicial guidance that could impact the relative merits and risk of tax positions these changes when they occur impact tax expense and can materially impact results of operations the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors assessed as part of the analysis include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity a vie in the context of the company and its managed funds is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the funds economic performance and the obligation to absorb lossesright to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund then the company is deemed to be the funds primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund assessing if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the fund’s economic results may involve significant judgment 

as of december 31 2021 the company consolidated cip that held investments of 90425 million december 31 2020  79100 million 

recent accounting standards 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies  accounting pronouncements recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

• causing the value of aum to decrease 

• causing the returns realized on aum to decrease impacting performance fees 

• causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the company does not serve 

• causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that the company manages into investments that the company does not manage 

• causing clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher revenues into products that earn lower revenues 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

  

  

  

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values of these financial instruments 



 

a if such a 10 increase or decrease in fair values were to occur the change attributable to 3379 million of these equity investments would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our pretax earnings at december 31 2021 2266 million of these equity investments are held to hedge economically certain deferred compensation plans in which the company participates in addition to holding equity investments in 2017 the company purchased a total return swap to economically hedge certain deferred compensation plans the notional value of the total return swap at december 31 2021 was 3431 million the company recognizes as compensation expense the appreciation or depreciation of the compensation liability over the awards vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award the company immediately recognizes the appreciation or depreciation of these investments which is included in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income which will reverse and will offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multiyear vesting period 

b these represent invesco’s direct investments in investment products that are consolidated upon consolidation these direct investments are eliminated and the assets and liabilities of the cip are consolidated in the consolidated balance sheets together with a noncontrolling interest balance representing the portion of the cip owned by third parties if a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values of invesco’s direct investments in cip were to occur it would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our net income attributable to invesco ltd 

cash balances invested in money market funds of 12700 million have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 18936 million have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

  

  

  

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2021 the interest rates on 1000 of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 59 years and the company had a balance of zero on its floating rate credit facility 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31 was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 9 “debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the sensitivity of our financial assets to interest rate risk is immaterial 

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting curr ency the company’s put option contract to hedge its poundsterlingbased operating income expired on june 30 2020 item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 geographic information c ontains disclosure of revenue by geography revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation losses were 11 million in 2021 2020 45 million of losses and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation and have put in place net investment hedge structures discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements note 11other comprehensive incomeloss

strategy 

the company focuses on four key longterm strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

• achieve strong longterm investment performance across distinct investment capabilities with clearly articulated investment philosophies and processes aligned with client needs 

  

  

  

• be instrumental to our clients success by delivering our distinctive investment capabilities worldwide to meet their needs 

• harness the power of our global platform by continuously improving execution effectiveness to enhance quality and productivity and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business and 

• perpetuate a highperformance organization by driving greater transparency accountability diversity of thought factbased decision making and execution at all levels 

as an integrated global investment manager we are keenly focused on meeting clients needs and operating effectively and efficiently we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

we believe one of invescos greatest strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm 

industry trends 

trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

• distribution partners are becoming more selective and are moving towards developing fewer relationships and partners reducing the number of investment managers with whom they work invesco provides a robust set of capabilities and creates investment solutions that delivers key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives invesco delivers competitive pricing investor education thought leadership digital platforms and other valueadded services that enhance the client experience 

• clients are also demanding more from investment managers while investment performance remains paramount competitive pricing client engagement and valueadded services including portfolio analytics and providing consultative solutions increasingly differentiate managers invesco is working to enhance the clients user experience through digital marketing web mobile social and improved service 

• investors continue to demand alternative passive and smart beta strategies as a consequence the industry is seeing client demand for core equities portfolios decline as a share of global flows invesco is the 3 provider of smart beta aum in the us and has 76 etfs with greater than 500 million in assets invesco also has a strong lineup of alternative and multiasset strategies supported by ongoing product development 

• we are seeing increased pressure on net revenue yield within the asset management industry arising from increased use of low fee passive products and further concentration within our channel distribution partners which increases their ability to negotiate pricing 

• regulatory activity remains at increased levels and is influencing competitive dynamics increased regulatory scrutiny of managers has focused on many areas including transparencyunbundling of fees inducements conflicts of interest capital liquidity solvency leverage operational risk management controls and compensation invesco continues to work proactively with regulators around the world efforts to further modernize and strengthen our global platform will enhance our ability to compete effectively across markets while complying with the variety of applicable regulatory regimes this is a key differentiator for large scaled firms such as invesco and smaller firms may struggle to make the necessary investment to stay current and comply with the increased regulation we are seeing globally 

• although the developed markets in the us and europe are currently the two largest markets for financial assets by a wide margin other key emerging markets in the world such as china and india are growing faster and positioned for greater future growth over the long term as these populationheavy markets mature we believe investment managers that are truly global will be in the best position to capture this growth additionally population age differences between emerging and developed markets will result in differing investment needs and horizons among countries asset allocation and retirement savings schemes also differ substantially among countries we believe firms such as invesco with experience in key markets and diversified investment capabilities and product types are best positioned to meet clients needs in this global competitive landscape invesco has a meaningful market presence in many of the worlds most attractive regions including north america emea and asiapacific we believe our strong and growing presence in established and emerging markets provides significant longterm growth potential for our business 

  

  

  

• technology advances are impacting core elements of the investment management industry which lags other industries in its use of technology clients increasingly seek to interact digitally with their investment portfolios this is leading to established managers investing in andor acquiring technology platforms as the investment management business becomes more complex automation will become increasingly important to serve clients effectively and efficiently invesco is leveraging technology across its business and exploring opportunities to work with thirdparty technology firms to enhance our clients investment experience over the past few years we have made strategic acquisitions to strengthen our digital wealth platform these acquisitions and others have strengthened our ability to offer competitive digital wealth capabilities and position us ahead of the evolving client needs 

as a result of the trends discussed above clients are seeking to work with a smaller number of asset managers who can deliver a comprehensive set of products and valueadded services they want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives they also want greater value for their money which means competitive pricing investor education thought leadership digital platforms and other valueadded services that enhance the client experience these dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry and we believe will drive increasing consolidation we believe the steps we have taken over the past decade and throughout 2020 strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure invesco is wellpositioned to compete and win within our industry over the long term 

investment management capabilities 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives 

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class

human capital 

invesco’s longterm success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talent invesco invests significantly in talent development health and welfare programs technology and other resources that support our employees in developing their full potential both personally and professionally we believe that an employee community that is diverse and inclusive engaged in community involvement and invested in employee wellbeing will drive positive outcomes for our clients and shareholders 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic created an unprecedented worldwide public health and business phenomenon our top priority in 2020 was the health and wellbeing of our worldwide employees in addition to other actions taken we continue to assess the general wellbeing of our employees their ability to stay well stay productive and stay connected 

in addition we regularly survey our employees in a confidential survey to gauge their sentiment across a variety of engagement categories including questions related to compensation benefits worklife balance career development inclusion teamwork and leadership and more recently our focus on social justice 

we believe that diversity and inclusion are both moral and business imperatives we are committed to improving diversity at all levels and in all functions across our global business as evidenced by our ceo and senior managing directors all including diversity and inclusion goals as part of their annual performance goals increasing representation of women and other underrepresented employees remains a focus for invesco as does building an inclusive environment at the end of 2020 our global workforce was 39 female and 61 male with 33 of senior managers worldwide being women unconscious bias training is required of all managers and is being expanded to the entire employee population our employees are also encouraged to participate in any of our nine business resource groups where employees with diverse backgrounds experiences and perspectives can connect these business resource groups are sponsored by senior leaders and are designed by employees for employees 

as of december 31 2020 the company had 8512 employees with an ontheground presence in over 20 countries december 31 2019 8821 none of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the level of fees the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the global investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients typically may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and evolving our risk management activities to ensure they keep pace with business change and client expectations we believe a key factor in our ability to manage through challenging market conditions and significant business change is our integrated and global approach to risk management risk management is embedded in our daytoday decisionmaking as well as our strategic planning process while our global risk management framework enables consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company 

  

  

  

our framework leverages two governance structures i our global performance and risk committee oversees the management of core investment risks and ii our corporate risk management committee oversees the management of all other business and strategy related risks a network of regional business unit and specific risk management committees with oversight of the corporate risk management committee provides ongoing identification assessment management and monitoring of risk that ensures both broad as well as indepth multilayered coverage of the risks existing and emerging in the various domains of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to the coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

as a result of the global market reactions to the covid19 pandemic our assets under management aum and revenues have been negatively impacted and we face various potential operational challenges due to the pandemic 

as a result of the global market reactions to the covid19 pandemic our assets under management aum and revenues declined significantly during the early phases of the pandemic as governments enacted social containment measures and central banks and governments sought to enact economic relief measures while many global markets have improved materially since the early stages of the pandemic further negative market reactions may occur as a result of failures to limit infections or deaths to the covid19 virus delays in developing andor delivering effective treatments for the virus and reduced support or positive impact of central banks and government economic relief measures additional negative market reactions could further negatively impact our aum and revenues the volatility in the global markets has also adversely affected the liquidity of certain managed investment products in which client and company assets are invested 

our efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic have required and will continue to require a significant investment of time and resources across our business in response to mandated precautions where applicable and to ensure the safety of our employees the significant majority of our employees are working remotely at this time while our teams have been successful in working remotely operational challenges may arise in the future many of the key service providers we rely on have also transitioned to working remotely if we or they were to experience material disruptions in the ability for our or their employees to work remotely eg disruption in internetbased communications systems or networks or the availability of essential goods and services our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course could be materially adversely disrupted to date our own employees and we believe the employees of our key service providers have not experienced any material degree of illness due to the covid19 virus if our or their workforces or key components thereof were to experience significant illness levels our ability to operate our business could be materially adversely disrupted further if our cyber security diligence and efforts to offset the increased risks associated with greater reliance on mobile collaborative and remote technologies during the covid19 pandemic as well as the increased frequency and sophistication of external threat actors are not effective or successful we may be at increased risk for data privacy or other cyber security incidents any such material adverse disruptions to our business operations or loss of information could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation or financial condition 

the extent to which our business results of operations aum and financial results are further affected by the covid‐19 pandemic will largely depend on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain including the duration and severity of the pandemic length of time it will take for the financial markets and economy to recover and for our employees to safely return to the workplace along with potentially more permanent impacts on how we operate and serve our clients in addition many of the risk factors described below may be heightened by the effects of the covid‐19 pandemic and related economic conditions 

risks related to market dynamics and volatility 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

• in the event of extreme circumstances including economic political or business crises such as a widespread systemic failure or disruptions in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties on financial instruments we may suffer significant declines in aum and severe liquidity or valuation issues in managed investment products in which client and company assets are invested all of which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition liquidity credit ratings ability to access capital markets and ability to retain and attract key employees additionally these factors could impact our ability to realize the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets 

• illiquidity andor volatility of the global fixed income andor equity markets could negatively affect our ability to manage client inflows and outflows or to timely meet client redemption requests 

• uncertainties regarding geopolitical developments such as brexit can produce volatility in global financial markets this may impact the levels and composition of our aum and also negatively impact investor sentiment which could result in reduced or negative flows the longer term relationship between the uk and the eu is still uncertain following the departure of the uk from the eu because the uk pound sterling is the functional currency 

  

  

  

for certain of our subsidiaries any weakening of the uk pound sterling relative to the us dollar could negatively impact our reported financial results 

• changes to united states tax tariff and importexport regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business any changes with respect to trade policies treaties taxes government regulations and tariffs or the perception that any of these changes could occur may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global trade and in particular trade between other nations and the united states given our strong position in asia pacific and emea we could be more adversely affected than others by such market uncertainties 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios our aum as of january 31 2021 were 13671 billion we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact the market value of our aum our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among client portfolios these could be caused by investors reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance relative or absolute of the client portfolios managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other competing products tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues which may have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain passively managed products our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products which may have an adverse effect on our revenues from certain fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav which may have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

certain changes in the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our client portfolios libor will be eliminated as a benchmark reference rate as a result of regulatory reform markets are developing replacement reference rates in response to this change questions around liquidity in these new rates and how to appropriately adjust relevant instruments and 

  

  

  

products to eliminate any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain a significant concern for us and others in the marketplace it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from libor the value or profitability of liborbased instruments held in our client portfolios or products we manage that use libor as a reference rate may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new instruments and products are commercially accepted and operationally mature 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments which may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2020 the company had approximately 8105 million in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or japanese yen among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

risks related to investment performance and competition 

poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our aum or affect our sales and negatively impact our revenues and income 

our investment performance is critical to the success of our business strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our products poor investment performance as compared to thirdparty benchmarks or competitive products has in the past led and could in the future lead to a decrease in sales of our products and stimulate redemptions from existing products generally lowering the overall level of aum and reducing our management fees there is no assurance that past or present investment performance in our products will be indicative of future performance if we fail or appear to fail to address successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any poor investment performance we may be unsuccessful in reversing such under performance and our future business prospects would likely be negatively affected 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in many products investors remain attracted to lower fee passive products which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products 

our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants around the world have also resulted in increased competition industry consolidation has increased in recent years both in the area of distributors and asset managers further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future 

our competitors can increase their market share to our detriment by reducing fees the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future 

  

  

  

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on the companys ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements new products often must be in the marketplace for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows increasingly clients and intermediaries are looking to investment mangers to be able to deliver investment outcomes tailored to particular circumstances and needs and to augment traditional investment management products and services with additional valueadded services a failure to continue to innovate and introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products irrespective of the performance of our products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us or the client portfolios we manage 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the client portfolios that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutions many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets such nonperformance could produce a financial loss for the company or the client portfolios we manage 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory agreements performance fees represented 656 million or 11 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing our earnings to be more volatile 

risks related to operating our business 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled investment management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients the market for skilled investment management professionals is highly competitive our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

  

  

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single intermediary is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary investment products which could limit the distribution of our products investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future similarly particularly in the united states certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers if a material portion of our distributors were to substantially narrow their product offerings it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability more broadly in both retail and institutional channels intermediaries distribution firms and consultants are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms they do business with while this offers opportunities to the company to have broader and deeper relationships with firms that continue to do business with us it also poses risks of additional lost business if a particular firm chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with the company any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these intermediaries and the consultant community due to any of the abovedescribed factors would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in costs of correction damage awards or regulatory fines and penalties against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements such as adherence to investment restrictions or limits that we are required to observe in the provision of our services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios such as registered funds a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements which could lead to fines and penalties against the company any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to seek to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us registered funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other funds generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason openend registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients other market participants and regulators and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including portfolio management errors or cyber breaches 

  

  

  

employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of other clients or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions protect the privacy of clients employees and business partners data and provide reports and provide other services to our clients 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of confidential data litigation and regulatory enforcement actions and reputational harm cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats although we seek to take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and seek to continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer malware or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business further thirdparty service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us regarding cyberincidents 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions including fines and penalties which could be material and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

  

  

  

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size multiple office locations and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations further as we maintain certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate clients or distributors and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs if our third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us it could lead to operational and regulatory problems including with respect to certain of our products which could result in losses enforcement actions or reputational harm and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 89163 million and 73056 million respectively at december 31 2020 we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

  

  

  

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’ earnings and business or regulatory considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital 

such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and we maintain capital within this european subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences as of december 31 2020 the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7636 million 

complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

risks related to strategic transactions 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

  

  

  

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

we have incurred and will continue to incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not offset these costs 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of oppenheimerfunds there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the business will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time as part of the integration activities for the oppenheimerfunds business the company has identified a matter that involves a possible loss contingency related to the operations of the acquired business see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 commitments and contingencies for additional information 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds we issued perpetual preferred stock having a value of approximately 4 billion which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and may limit our ability to fund other priorities 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds invesco issued approximately 4 billion of 59 fixed rate perpetual preferred stock to certain of oppenheimerfunds former shareholders this issuance may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of common shares in certain circumstances may increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions and will require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to make required dividend payments to preferred shareholders 

risks related to our significant shareholder 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds we issued approximately 819 million common shares which could adversely impact our trading price upon resale of those common shares 

we issued approximately 819 million common shares in connection with the acquisition most of which are held by massachusetts mutual life insurance company massmutual the common shares held by massmutual are subject to an agreement not to sell those common shares prior to may 24 2021 subject to early termination in certain circumstances as well as to certain limitations on resales massmutual may in the future sell these common shares in the open market or through secondary offerings if massmutual were to sell its equity stake in invesco or express an intention to sell the stake that action could have a significant impact on our common share trading price 

massmutual has the ability to significantly influence our business and massmutual’s interest in our business may be different from that of other shareholders 

massmutual is entitled to designate an individual to serve on our board so long as it beneficially owns at least i 10 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock or ii x 5 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and y 20 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our series a preferred shares additionally we are not permitted to take certain actions without the prior written approval of massmutual including making certain changes in our capital structure or our organizational documents adopting a shareholder rights plan or effectuating certain business combination transactions massmutual’s level of ownership and influence may make some transactions such as those involving mergers material share issuances or changes in control more difficult or impossible without the support of massmutual which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock the interests of massmutual may conflict with the interests of other shareholders 

  

  

  

risks related to regulatory and legal matters 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in most countries and any enforcement action or significant changes in the laws or regulations governing our business or any firm specific regulatory or enforcement actions could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and we have seen a significant increase in regulatory changes actions and scrutiny in recent years in part due to a concern that the asset management industry or certain of its entities or activities pose systemic risks to the financial system without limiting the generality of the foregoing regulators in the united states and the united kingdom have taken and can be expected to continue to take a more aggressive posture on bringing enforcement proceedings laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to require registration or licenses limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements or actions which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business delay or deny approval for new products or service offerings cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or services impair the investment performance of other products or services impact product mix increase compliance costs andor impose additional capital requirements our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees further regulators across borders could coordinate actions against us as issues arise resulting in impacts on our business in multiple jurisdictions judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our aum results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom subsidiaries operating in the european union eu are subject to various eu directives which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the uk and the eu in particular have promulgated or are considering various new or revised regulatory measures pertaining to financial services including investment managers such measures are progressing at various stages such measures in the eu generally have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states ongoing changes in the uk’s and eu’s regulatory framework applicable to our business as related to brexit and any other changes may add further complexity to our global risks and operations 

regulatory developments and changes specific to our business will or may include without limitation 

• regulations pertaining to the privacy use and retention of data with respect to clients employees and business partners the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe has strengthened privacy rules for individuals in europe granting individuals more rights and control over the use of their personal information by organizations doing business with them and greatly increased penalties for noncompliance the gdpr has also influenced the subsequent direction and strengthening of privacy regulations globally at a state level in the us such as ccpa cpra and wpa and in various other jurisdictions we operate in globally such as canada india china and hong kong the 2020 ruling by the european court of justice on eu to us personal data transfers “schrems ii” and subsequent response by the european commission has created uncertainty on future legal frameworks to facilitate international transfers of european personal data 

• an increased focus on liquidity in funds including fixed income funds an example of which is the sec’s rules with respect to liquidity and liquidity risk management applicable to certain types of registered us funds or the recent studies of global and eu regulators on the resilience of investment funds during the covid 19 related market turmoil 

• forthcoming eu and uk regulations pertaining to integrating environmental social and governance esg topics may materially impact the asset management industry in eu member states that adopt such legislation and in the uk for example the eu’s recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate esg into the financial system including such areas as mifid ii ucits and aifmd regulations through the integration of esg 

  

  

  

risks and new esg disclosure obligations we expect the sec and other regulators in the us to pursue similar initiatives the sec also may promulgate additional disclosure obligations that would apply to the company with respect to matters such as environmental impact of our business operations our employee and board diversity and other esgrelated matters 

• requirements pertaining to the trading of securities and other financial instruments such as swaps and other derivatives including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and european market infrastructure regulation these include significant reporting requirements designated trading venues mandated central clearing arrangements restrictions on proprietary trading by certain financial institutions other conduct requirements and potentially new taxes or similar fees 

• changes to the investment trading and distribution models across emea as a result of ongoing changes to the relationship between the united kingdom uk and the eu after the departure of the uk from the eu despite the trade deal announced in december 2020 the impact on the financial services industry remains unclear 

• limitations on holdings of certain physical commodity futures contracts and other physical commodity related derivatives positions under regulations of the cftc which could result in capacity constraints for our products that employ physical commodities as part of their investment strategy 

• potential limitations on the ability of our us registered funds to enter into derivatives transactions under regulations of the sec 

• regulations impacting the standard of care a financial adviser owes to its clients including the sec’s best interests standard and similar standards promulgated by the us department of labor 

• increased requirements to provide regulators and investors more granular detail regarding our products and services including the sec’s reporting modernization rule applicable to certain types of registered us funds and mifid ii trade and transaction reporting in the uk and the eu 

• enhanced licensing and qualification requirements for key personnel including the united kingdom senior managers and certification regime 

• strengthening standards regarding various ethical matters including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and antimoneylaundering laws and regulations 

• regulations promulgated to address risks of fraud malfeasance or other adverse consequences stemming from cyber attacks and ensure the digital operational resilience of firms 

• regulations promulgated to address perceptions that the asset management industry or certain of its entities or activities pose systematic risks to the financial system 

• the application of antitrust and similar competition laws to the asset management industry including aggregation of filing obligations across managed portfolios under the us hartscottrodino act and the implications of common ownership of issuers within the industry 

• guidelines regarding the structure and components of fund manager compensation and other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements certain provisions impose additional disclosure burdens on public companies certain proposals could impose requirements for more widespread disclosures of compensation to highlypaid individuals depending upon the scope of any such requirements invesco could be disadvantaged in retaining key employees visàvis private companies including hedge fund sponsors 

• other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over invesco 

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or possible enforcement proceedings on our business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations 

  

  

  

and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20  commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union eu are involved in much of the coordinated activity including 

• in 2018 the eu introduced mandatory disclosure rules dac6 requiring disclosure to tax authorities of crossborder arrangements entered into by taxpayers that fall within certain broadly defined hallmarks beginning in july 1 2020  

• the oecd has undertaken beps 20 focused on “addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy” this project may impact all multinational businesses by allocating a greater share of taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the current physical presence of a business and by implementing a global minimum tax 

• the oecd has also launched an analytical database on individual multinationals and affiliates “adima” a database containing public information on the physical and digital locations of corporations including revenue profit income tax and number of employees 

• bermuda has adopted economic substance regulations to comply with the eu code of conduct for business taxation and tax policies which requires invesco ltd to file annual declarations 

we continually assess the impact of various u  s  federal state and foreign legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries which could result in a material increase in our us federal state or foreign taxes we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if unfavorable legislation were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company  including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity  

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to both income and nonincome based taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which are subject to current and potentially future tax audits the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

the european commission continues to investigate certain tax rulings and beneficial regimes provided by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken including retroactive application 10year period conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties while the company does not believe it has received state aid and is currently not a party to any investigation due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company 

  

  

  

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director’s duties to that company the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our third amended and restated byelaws byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based 

  

  

  

on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

• we are prohibited from engaging under certain circumstances in a business combination as defined in our byelaws with any interested shareholder as defined in our byelaws for three years following the date that the shareholder became an interested shareholder 

• our board of directors without further shareholder action is permitted by our byelaws to issue preference shares in one or more series and determine by resolution any designations preferences qualifications privileges limitations restrictions or special or relative rights of an additional series the rights of preferred shareholders may supersede the rights of common shareholders 

• shareholders may only remove directors for “cause” defined in our byelaws to mean willful misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious to the company fraud or embezzlement or a conviction of or a plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to a felony 

• our board of directors is authorized to expand its size and fill vacancies and 

• shareholders cannot act by written consent unless the consent is unanimous 

general risk factors 

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a2stable bbbstable and apositive from moodys investor services moodys standard  poors ratings service sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to access additional financing management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding total longterm debt of 20826 million excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to invesco ltd of 143618 million the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

although we seek to foster a positive workplace culture have adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks we cannot ensure that our 

  

  

  

workplace culture or such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation could lead to costly regulatory inquiries fines andor sanctions and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management has elected to apply the fast act modernization and simplification of regulation sk which provides the option to limit the discussion to the two most recent calendar years the discussion and analysis disclosed herein apply to material changes in the consolidated financial statements for 2020 and 2019 for the comparison of 2019 and 2018 see the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of the company’s 2019 annual report on form 10k filed with the securities and exchange commission on march 2 2020 the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” should be read in conjunction with the “forwardlooking statements” disclosure set forth in part i and the “risk factors” set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10‑k each of which describe our risks uncertainties and other important factors in more detail 

  

  

  

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

throughout 2020 global markets experienced record levels of volatility transitioning quickly from highs in the beginning of the year to extreme lows as global markets first reacted to the covid19 pandemic the pandemic had a severe impact on the economy increasing unemployment and decreasing consumer spending throughout the global markets however beginning in april 2020 equity markets in many major indices experienced near continual gains throughout the remainder of 2020 more than reversing losses earlier in the year the increasing equity markets were driven by the softening of social containment measures and reopening of businesses following shutdowns earlier in the year accommodative fiscal and monetary policies enacted by many central governments and the authorization of multiple covid19 vaccines despite the increase in equity markets the economy contracted in many developed and developing countries in 2020 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31 returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2020 and 2019 



the companys financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the us dollar our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields 

invesco benefits from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of aum one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographic diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

update on significant events and transactions 

over the past decade weve been highly focused on investing ahead of shifts in client demand putting us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future during 2020 we continued to invest in capabilities where we see client demand or future opportunities by hiring strong talent further upgrading our technology platform and launching new products we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm 

as previously disclosed we are undertaking a strategic evaluation of our business focusing on four key areas of our expense base our organizational model our real estate footprint management of third party spend and technology and operations efficiency we plan to invest in key areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan including etfs fixed income china solutions alternatives and global equities while creating permanent annual net operating expense improvements of 200 million a significant element of the savings will be generated from realigning our workforce to support key areas of growth as well as repositioning some of our workforce to lower cost locations we expect 150 million of the savings to be achieved by 

  

  

  

the end of 2021 with the remainder by the end of 2022 remaining restructuring costs related to the strategic evaluation are estimated to be in a range of 150 to 175 million over the next two years with 1190 million incurred in 2020 

in 2019 invesco completed the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds ofi and the integration of our two firms building on the combination with ofi in 2020 we further deepened our relationships with clients in the us expanded the capabilities we offered globally and further scaled our business for the benefit of clients and shareholders the firm is also highly focused on delivering the additional capabilities achieved through the combination to institutional and nonus markets 

managing our business and meeting client needs through covid19 

invesco is committed to helping our employees our clients and our communities navigate the challenges presented by the impacts of covid19 the primary focus of our efforts is to ensure the health and safety of our employees while preserving our ability to serve clients and manage assets in a highly dynamic market environment as always we are committed to helping our clients achieve their investment objectives through disciplined longterm investing to this end we continue to proactively engage with our clients virtually to help them better navigate market volatility by providing thought leadership and other valueadded services we believe our client centric approach will enable our clients to emerge from this crisis stronger 

to ensure we continue to meet client needs in a primarily remoteworking environment small select teams are working at alternate sites or operating in split shifts to mitigate the risks associated with the virus some of our offices in locations across the globe have begun staged reopenings we will continue to be responsive to the evolving threat of the virus and may reclose if necessary decisions regarding openings and closings of our offices are supported by information from local government and health officials as well as our own internal research regarding the needs of our employees and clients 

our portfolio managers research analysts and traders are successfully working remotely or in secure locations with access to all systems necessary to do their jobs and an ability to connect with their teams in managing client assets additionally our operational control and support teams are primarily working in a remote environment in light of the remote working environment we continue to assess and enhance our business continuity plans as well as our internal controls with appropriate adjustments made to address the environment this thoughtful coordinated approach helps ensure our ability to continue to meet client needs and to run our business 

other external factors impacting invesco 

invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of our peers as one of the leading investment managers in the uk and europe we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding brexit additionally our strong position in asiapacific meant that invesco was more affected than others by market uncertainties over the trade issues between china and the us 

on december 24 2020 the uk and the eu european union announced a trade deal after months of negotiations the deal came into force effective december 31 2020 while the deal announced largely covers goods details related to the financial services industry are not specifically outlined within the agreement the uk and the eu aim to agree by march 2021 to a memorandum of understanding establishing a framework for regulatory cooperation on financial services the brexit outcome at the end of 2020 was largely anticipated by the market 

invesco is a global business and has been committed for many years to meeting clients’ needs across europe in both eu and noneu countries invesco has local teams of experts focused on servicing local clients and fund ranges in different countries to meet a variety of local country and regional client needs we currently have a presence in 12 countries across europe our staff will be able to continue to reside and work across the relevant regions the change in the uks status from an eu to a noneu country will not change invesco’s focus or commitment to serve its clients across europe we are fully prepared to continue to operate and deliver for our clients with minimal disruption 

investment exposure to the london interbank offered rate libor based interest rates could impact our client portfolios the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor has made it clear that the publication of libor is not guaranteed beyond 2021 the ice benchmark administration iba which administers libor recently consulted on the extension of five of the seven total settings overnight and one three six and twelve month usdlibor with a possible cessation extension date to june 30 2023 as a result firms must transition away from libor to alternative riskfree rates working groups and regulators across various jurisdictions have put forth libor transition plan guidance including recommendations related to the potential cessation extension date of five of seven settings of us dollar usd libor invesco continues to actively monitor and adjust the libor transition strategy and timeline as necessary such as choosing to adhere to the recent international swaps  derivatives association isda protocol that provides a clear fallback rate for legacy libor 

  

  

  

linked derivative contracts upon libor cessation the discontinuance of libor may adversely affect the amount of interest or other amounts payable or receivable on certain portfolio investments these changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments invesco finalized its global assessment of exposure in relation to funds holding libor based instruments and funds utilizing libor as a benchmark andor performance target invesco is prioritizing the mitigation of risks associated with financial instruments held and benchmarksperformance targets used that reference existing libor rates as well as any impact on invesco portfolios and investment strategies invesco continues to monitor overall industry transition progress and completes ongoing analysis of the suitability of alternative riskfree rates 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of consolidated investment products 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various retail mutual funds and similar entities private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products the company is required to consolidate certain of these managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1 accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10k report as consolidated investments products cip the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

• results of operations year ended december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 

• schedule of nongaap information 

• balance sheet discussion and 

• liquidity and capital resources 

to assess the impact of cip on the companys results of operations and balance sheet discussion refer to part ii item 8 financial statements note 21 consolidated investment products the impact on the companys results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 was a reduction of 398 million this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products 

wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and other income and expenses nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented

assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum include indexbased etfs unit investment trusts uits nonmanagement fee earning aum and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

nonmanagement fee earning aum includes nonmanagement fee earning etfs uit and product leverage the net flows in nonmanagement fee earning aum can be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to certain aum as longterm longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity we present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

changes in aum were as follows  



1 the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds business on may 24 2019 added 2244 billion in aum at that date the acquisition of guggenheim investments etf business on april 6 2018 added 381 billion in aum at that date as of july 1 2018 we began including 100 of invesco great wall which added 95 billion in aum during the third quarter of 2018 

2 gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum excluding invesco great wall aum prior to the third quarter 2018 management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments given the companys influence on invesco great wall a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle to obtain majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter of 2018 a verage aum in 2020 for our jvs in china was 500 billion 2019 356 billion 2018 162 billion it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of our jvs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum because the revenues resulting from 

  

  

  

these aum are not presented in our operating revenues under us gaap our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income additionally the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from cip and our jvs in china however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the companys true effective fee rate from aum 

3 net revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average aum see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues 

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

market returns 

market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis during 2020 global equity markets saw significant volatility due to the covid19 pandemic beginning in march 2020 and continuing through 2020 the resulting decline in aum adversely impacted our revenues during the first half of the year but market recovery increased our average aum and revenues during the second half of the year however market dynamics have also changed the aum product mix which has an effect on our revenue yield as discussed further below 

foreign exchange rates 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced increases in aum of 103 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates december 31 2019 aum increased by 25 billion  

acquisitions 

there were no acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds on may 24 2019 which added 2244 billion in aum during the year 

revenue yield 

as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the us changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of us dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields changes in our aum mix also significantly impact our net revenue yield passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes and changes in the mix of products therefore have an impact on our net revenue yield at the industry level investors continue to shift towards passive products and away from active and invesco is able to participate in this trend due to the breadth strength and diversified nature of our business 

i n the year ended december 31 2020 the net revenue yield was 377 basis points compared to 403 basis points in the year ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 26 basis points 

in 2019 yields improved after the second quarter acquisition of oppenheimerfunds which contributed aum of 2244 billion comprised of 2199 billion of active and 45 billion of passive aum increasing the proportion of active aum and positively impacting net revenue yield however aum mix in 2020 was impacted by flows into lower fee products from the market impact of the covid19 pandemic and from the growth in our qqq fund all of which increased the proportion of lowerfee aum which has lowered net revenue yield in 2020 as passive products generally have lower fees than active products the aum shift towards passive has contributed to the declining net revenue yield passive aum includes our qqq etf for which we do not receive a management fee but which delivers significant marketing and brand value and increases invesco’s footprint leadership and relevance in the etf market at december 31 2020 passive aum were 3706 billion representing 275 of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2019 passive aum were 2970 billion representing 242 of our total aum at that date 

  

  

  

also contributing to the overall decline the net revenue yield specific to passive aum has declined particularly from the impact of the growth of the qqq fund at december 31 2020 the qqq fund represented 1525 billion or 411 of passive aum at december 31 2019 the qqq fund represented 869 billion or 293 of passive aum in the year ended december 31 2020 the net revenue yield on passive aum was 120 basis points compared to 146 basis points in the year ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 26 basis points 

market volatility in 2020 also contributed to investors moving into lower risk assets such as money market and stable 

value funds which are active funds with lower fees we saw outflows from equity products and alternatives and inflows into fixed income and other relatively lower fee products these changes have decreased the net revenue yield on active aum at december 31 2020 active aum were 9793 billion representing 725 of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2019 active aum were 9292 billion representing 758 of our total aum at that date in the year ended december 31 2020 the net revenue yield on active aum was 464 basis points compared to 486 basis points in the year ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 22 basis points 

the changes described above have adversely impacted our revenue and resulting revenue yields and we expect they will continue to pressure revenues and yields in the near term

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



 

1 total revenue adjustments includes passed through investment management service and distribution and other revenues and equal the same amount as the third party distribution service and advisory expenses 

2 net revenues are operating revenues less revenue adjustments plus net revenues from invesco great wall plus management and performance fees earned from cip see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating revenues by 132 million equivalent to 02 of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2020 when compared to the year ended december 31 2019 639 million decrease in 2019 or 10 of 2019 total operating revenues 

additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period as discussed in the “executive overview” section above equity markets showed extreme volatility as global markets reacted to the covid19 pandemic in the year ended december 31 2020 with all time highs at the beginning of the period followed by an extreme downturn and a subsequent recovery resulting in record highs in equity values by the end of the period the 2020 results were also impacted by shifts in the mix of aum resulting both from flows and from the market impact of the covid19 pandemic which has adversely impacted our revenue and resulting revenue yields in 2020 

  

  

  

investment management fees 

investment management fees decreased by 553 million 12 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 44510 million year ended december 31 2019 45063 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by 111 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 after allowing for foreign exchange movements investment management fees decreased by 664 million 15 average aum increased 92 when compared to the 2019 period primarily driven by the acquired oppenheimerfunds business acquired may 24 2019 however shifts in the mix of aum resulting both from flows and from the market impact of the covid19 pandemic resulted in a lower revenue yield on aum in 2020 which resulted in lower revenues 

see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the impact of changes in aum on management fee yields

invesco great wall 

the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture management believes that the net revenues from invesco great wall should be added to total operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that invesco great wall is making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the company began reporting 100 of invesco great wall in its net revenues and adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter of 2018 as a result the company’s nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

  

  

  

net revenues from invesco great wall were 2632 million and average aum was 500 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 net rev enues were 1572 million and average aum was 356 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements for the year ended december 31 2020 increased net revenues from invesco great wall by 30 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  after allowing for foreign exchange movements net revenues from invesco great wall were 2602 million the increase in revenue is driven by a 585 increase in management fees reflective of a 404 increase in average aum in the year ended december 31 2020 when compared to the prior period as well as increased performance fees of 344 million compared to 62 million in 2019 

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

management and performance fees earned from cip increased by 63 million to 398 million in the year ended december 31 2020 year ended december 31 2019 335 million the increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from newly launched clos

headcount at december 31 2020 was 8512 december 31 2019 8821 with the decrease primarily due to the strategic evaluation initiative impacts in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as realized synergies occurring after the oppenheimerfunds acquisition

other income and expenses 

the main categories of other income and expenses and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows 



equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by 163 million 289 to 727 million in the year ended december 31 2020 year ended december 31 2019 564 million the increase in is primarily driven by our joint venture investments in china real estate and other investments 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 64 million 47 to 1293 million in the year ended december 31 2020 year ended december 31 2019 1357 million driven by the lower average balance on the credit facility during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019

in the year ended december 31 2020 interest and dividend income of cip decreased by 431 million 125 to 3023 million year ended december 31 2019 3454 million interest expense of cip decreased by 340 million 149 to 1945 million year ended december 31 2019 2285 million the decrease in interest income and interest expense of cip is primarily due to less net interest income for clos in 2020 

  

  

  

included in other gainslosses of cip net are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip in the year ended december 31 2020 other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of 321 million compared to a net gain of 329 million in the year ended december 31 2019 the net gain during 2020 was attributable to marketdriven gains of investments held by consolidated funds 

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the 

companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2020 resulted in a net increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd of 94 million year ended december 31 2019 16 million net decrease 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of nonclo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per common share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders similarly any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos offsetting in other gainslosses of cip and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per common share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate aum 

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes incomelosses of cip however the companys operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under us gaap as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation therefore foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 geographic information in which cip has been eliminated may not correlate 

total us income before taxes increased 3347 million during the year ended december 31 2020 to 8458 million from 5111 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and includes us income of cip of 401 million december 31 2019 242 million us income from cip increased 159 million 657 from 2019 primarily due to the impact of gains on consolidated retail products excluding cip us income before taxes in 2020 increased 3188 million 655 from december 31 2019 due to a larger increase in us operating revenues than operating expenses 

total foreign income before taxes decreased 2385 million during the year ended december 31 2020 to 2233 million from 4618 million during the year ended december 31 2019 and includes foreign income of cip of 152 million december 31 2019 foreign income of cip of 237 million foreign income from cip decreased 85 million 356 from 2019 primarily due to lower net gains on consolidated retail products excluding cip foreign income decreased by 2300 million 525 from 2019 due to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate increased to 245 for the year ended december 31 2020 from 242 for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the increase in income generated in higher taxing jurisdictions relative to total income and an increase in the unfavorable adjustment for common sharebased compensation for additional income tax information refer to note 17 taxation in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

  

  

schedule of nongaap information 

we utilize the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and adjusted diluted earnings per common share eps the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors these measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income operating margin net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to a nongaap basis of net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation adjusted diluted eps these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any us gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates notes to the reconciliations follow the tables 

reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues 



reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income 



  

  

  

reconciliation of net income attributable to invesco ltd to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd 



 

 operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues 

 adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues 

 adjusted diluted eps is equal to adju sted net income attributable to invesco ltd divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding there is no difference between the calculated earnings per common share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per common share amounts under the two class method 

1 invesco great wall 

prior to the third quarter of 2018 management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments given the companys influence on invesco great wall a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle in the third quarter of 2018 to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall also beginning in the third quarter of 2018 the companys nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

2 revenue adjustments 

management believes that adjustments to investment management fees service and distribution fees and other revenues from operating revenues appropriately reflect these revenues as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these adjustments vary by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

investment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fundrelated costs other is primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties while the terms used for these types of adjustments vary by geography they are all costs that are driven by the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these revenues and expenses gross under us gaap on the consolidated statements of income 

  

  

  

3 cip 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 21 “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

  

cip revenue 



4 transaction integration and restructuring related adjustments 

the transaction integration and restructuring charges reflect legal regulatory advisory valuation and other professional services or consulting fees and travel costs related to a business combination transaction or restructuring initiatives related to changes in the scope of the business or manner in which the business is conducted also included in these charges are severancerelated expenses and any contract termination costs associated with these efforts additionally these charges reflect the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction or initiative and the costs of amortizing acquired intangible assets and integrating an acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings following a business combination or restructuring initiative 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and restructuring related charges see results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019  transaction integration and restructuring for additional details 

5 market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities 

certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically managed by the company invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through total return swap financial instruments us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation depreciation are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

  

  

  

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares or swaps will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

see below for a reconciliation of deferred compensation related items 



  

  

  

6 other reconciling items 

each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 



 

a the company recorded a charge of 1053 million in the second quarter of 2020 due to a previously disclosed sp 500 equal weight funds rebalancing correction due to the unique character and magnitude of this item it has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures  

b as a result of an increase in our recoverable vat from applying additional regulatory guidance a credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 the portion of the cumulative adjustment representing 2015 through 2017 has been removed for nongaap purposes 

c operating expenses for 2017 reflect the cost of multiple senior executive retirements the costs incurred in one quarter were unprecedented and the company deemed it appropriate to adjust these costs from the us gaap total compensation in an effort to isolate and evaluate our level of compensation going forward the result of this adjustment was 197 million related to accelerated vesting of deferred compensation and other separation costs 

d included within other gains and losses net is the marktomarket of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterlingus dollar and the eurous dollar foreign exchange rates the pound sterling contracts provided coverage through june 30 2020 and the euro contracts provided coverage through december 27 2017 the adjustment from us gaap to non

j 2020 included both a noncash income tax benefit of 43 million arising from the revaluation of certain intangible deferred tax liabilities due to tax rate changes partially offset by a noncash income tax expense of 36 million arising from the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities due to the increase in the uk corporate tax rate 2017 included a 1307 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the impacts of the 2017 tax cut and jobs act enacted in the united states

liquidity and capital resources 

our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements material changes in the companys capital structure over the last two years include

capital management 

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

• reinvestment in the business 

• maintain strong balance sheet 

• moderate growth of dividends as further discussed in the dividends section below and 

• share repurchases 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings as of the filing of the report invesco held credit ratings of bbbstable a3stable and astable from standard  poor’s ratings service “sp” moody’s investor services “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” respectively our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on several factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy including the impact of covid19 investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and we maintain capital within this european subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2020 the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7636 million december 31 2019 7536 million the increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of the pound sterling against the us dollar partially offset by lower aum in the uk 

  

  

  

the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 10348 million at december 31 2020 december 31 2019 8470 million 

the consolidation of 83872 million and 67141 million of total assets and longterm debt of cip as of december 31 2020 respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the majority of cip balances related to consolidated clos the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 21 “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

cash flow discussion 

the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments common share repurchases capital expenditures and ongoing operating expenses is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our common shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

the following table represents a reconciliation of the cash flow information presented on a us gaap basis to the cash flow information excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated investment products for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the table 



 

1 these tables include nongaap presentations cash held by cip is not available for use by invesco additionally there is no recourse to invesco for cip debt the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions policyholder assets and liabilities are equal and offsetting and have no impact on invesco’s shareholder’s equity the impact of cash inflowsoutflows from policyholder assets and liabilities are reflected within cash flows from operating activities as changes in receivables andor payables as applicable

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

  

  

  

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions as of december 31 2020 our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is 14084 million see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 22 “related parties” for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 20826 million in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2020

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future the discussion below provides information on the significant judgments and assumptions applied in each area and should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies footnote previously referenced 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2020 and 2019 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeded its carrying value during our annual impairment test in 2020 and 2019 management performed the optional qualitative approach which indicated that a quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary due to the decline in our assets under management resulting from covid19 management also performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test which indicated no impairment the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 89163 million and 85094 million at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related effective fee rates 

when management utilizes the option to first assess goodwill impairment on a qualitative basis the totality of certain events and circumstances are assessed to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance of the company and or significant changes in share price if the qualitative assessment indicates that an impairment may be likely or management elected to not perform the qualitative assessment management performs a quantitative test to determine the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates projected effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates 

the quantitative test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains or losses and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the aum growth rate fee rates operating expense and the discount rate to determine present value the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis similar to goodwill management has the option to first assess indefinitelived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset in addition managements judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 625 million 527 million and 297 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if a quantitative assessment is required the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if required fair value 

  

  

  

is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix projected effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most sensitive of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate fee rates operating expense and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions during 2020 and 2019 our annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required due to the decline in our assets under management resulting from covid19 management also performed a quantitative impairment test on certain indefinitelived intangible assets in the first quarter of 2020 which indicated no impairment 

income taxes 

we operate in numerous countries states and other taxing jurisdictions the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities significant judgment is required in the determination of our annual income tax provision s  which includes the assessment of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions as well as the interpretation and application of existing and newly enacted tax laws regulation changes and new judicial rulings therefore it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to changes in the interpretation of applicable guidance or as a result of examinations by taxing authorities 

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers all available evidence which includes the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

in the assessment of uncertain tax positions significant judgment is required to estimate the range of possible outcomes and determine the probability on a more likely than not basis of favorable or unfavorable outcomes upon ultimate settlement of an issue unrecognized tax benefits as well as the related interest and penalties are regularly evaluated and adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense

as of december 31 2020 the company consolidated cip that held investments of 79100 million december 31 2019 78080 million 

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as 

  

  

  

appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business 

as described in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20 “commitments and contingencies” the company has accrued an estimated liability of 3878 million related to a restatement of certain historical fund financial statements the liability represents the expected reimbursement to fund shareholders and excludes any amounts that may be recovered through indemnification and insurance recoveries as well as other remediation costs related to the matter such as legal and consulting costs or the costs of communicating with fund shareholders uncertainties remain as of the date of this report regarding the nature scope and amounts of such costs as well as the degree to which the company will ultimately be financially responsible for bearing such costs 

regarding the estimated liability the primary source of uncertainty is the activity of the underlying fund shareholders in omnibus accounts the majority of which data the company has not yet received the determination of the liability due to each fund shareholder will be based on a number of factors including 

• the timing of fund shareholder transactions 

• the frequency and magnitude of fund shareholder transactions 

• the dates on which each fund shareholder opened and closed his or her account and 

• the difference between the historical net asset value of the funds and the corrected price on the dates when a fund shareholder engaged in transaction activity and the funds made distributions 

the calculation of the liability depends on these variables in the aggregate therefore it is not possible to evaluate the impact of possible trends in each variable on the overall calculation additionally given the unique nature of each outstanding thirdparty data set we are not able to determine a range of reasonably possible outcomes at this time

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

• causing the value of aum to decrease 

• causing the returns realized on aum to decrease impacting performance fees 

• causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the company does not serve 

• causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that the company manages into investments that the company does not manage 

• causing clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher revenues into products that earn lower revenues 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged  a 10 decline i n the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

  

  

  

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values of these financial instruments 



 

a if such a 10 increase or decrease in fair values were to occur the change attributable to 3603 million of these equity investments would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our pretax earnings at december 31 2020 2027 million of these equity investments are held to hedge economically certain deferred compensation plans in which the company participates in addition to holding equity investments in 2017 the company purchased a total return swap to economically hedge certain deferred compensation plans the notional value of the total return swap at december 31 2020 was 2793 million the company recognizes as compensation expense the appreciation or depreciation of the compensation liability over the awards vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award the company immediately recognizes the appreciation or depreciation of these investments which is included in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income which will reverse and will offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multiyear vesting period 

b these represent invesco’s direct investments in investment products that are consolidated upon consolidation these direct investments are eliminated and the assets and liabilities of the cip are consolidated in the consolidated balance sheets together with a noncontrolling interest balance representing the portion of the cip owned by third parties if a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values of invesco’s direct investments in cip were to occur it would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our net income attributable to invesco ltd 

c during 2015 the company acquired investment management contracts from deutsche bank this liability represents the purchase price which was comprised solely of contingent consideration payable in future periods and is linked to future revenues generated from the contracts in connection with the oppenheimerfunds acquisition see note 2 “business combinations” invesco acquired a contingent consideration liability related to historical oppenheimerfunds transactions additionally the company made other digital wealth acquisitions during 2019 which resulted in a contingent consideration liability linked to sales targets during 2020 2021 and 2022 the contingent consideration liabilities referenced above were recorded at fair value at each respective acquisition date and subsequent changes in the fair value are recorded in other gains and losses net in the consolidated statements of income if a 10 increase or decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability were to occur it would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our net income attributable to invesco ltd 

cash balances invested in money market funds of 9473 million have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 75821 million have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

  

  

  

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2020 the interest rates on 1000 of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 69 years and the company had a balance of zero on its floating rate credit facility 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31 was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 9 “debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the sensitivity of our financial assets to interest rate risk is immaterial 

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency the company’s put option contract to hedge its poundsterlingbased operating income expired on june 30 2020 item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 geographic information contains disclosure of revenue by geography revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation losses were 45 million in 2020 2019 136 million of losses and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation and have put in place net investment hedge structures discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements note 11other comprehensive incomeloss

strategy 

the company focuses on four key longterm strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

  

  

  

 

as an integrated global investment manager we are keenly focused on meeting clients needs and operating effectively and efficiently we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

we believe one of invescos greatest strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm 

environmental social and governance “esg” responsibility 

esg investment stewardship 

invesco’s differentiated approach to esg investment stewardship is guided by our purpose  to deliver an investment experience that helps people get more out of life we define esg investment stewardship as the inclusion of esg issues in investment analysis and decisions as well as the use of our rights and positions of ownership to seek to influence the activities or behaviors of companies we invest in on behalf of our clients 

invesco has been implementing esg investment strategies for over 30 years and today we deliver these strategies through certain equities fixed income multiasset alternatives real estate etfs and bespoke investment solutions mandates we aim for such mandates to continuously develop and deliver esg investment solutions which take into consideration esg research analysis and risk assessments we believe that material esg risks inherent in or taken by a company in which we invest or seek to invest on behalf of our clients may adversely impact the fundamentals of that company and negatively impact achieving the investment objective of such mandates 

our commitment to esg investment stewardship is also evidenced in part by 

 

in addition invesco believes the voting of proxies of companies in which we invest should be managed with the same care as all other elements of the investment process our proxy voting process is driven by investment professionals and focuses on maximizing longterm value for our clients which in part is driven by appropriate esg practices our esg practices seek where appropriate to promote sustainable social and environmental targets in line with investor organizations like pri the stewardship codes discussed above and initiatives like the task force on climate related disclosure 

for more information regarding invescos esg investment stewardship please see our most recent investment stewardship and proxy voting report on the companys website 

corporate stewardship 

at invesco corporate stewardship efforts are motivated by the belief that doing what is right for the environment our people and the communities in which we have a presence helps us deliver positive outcomes for our shareholders we actively partner with nonprofits startups and other organizations to improve financial education protect the environment promote environmental sustainability champion diversity and inclusion in our industry and our company and support and collaborate with our local civic and community organizations to improve life in our cities 

operating environmentally responsibly is fundamental to our corporate stewardship invesco seeks to help protect our natural environment by implementing and maintaining environmental management processes  for example at invesco offices we aim to reduce utility consumption and carbon emissions promote energy efficiency and utilize appropriate waste management practices some of our recent achievements include 

  

  

  

 

2019 developments 

throughout 2019 global markets were strong despite periods of volatility throughout the year uncertainty in the economic environment and weaker industry production metrics at times in the year led the us fed and many other central banks to aggressively lower interest rates to support global growth despite this uncertainty the global economy grew at a modest pace 

the most significant undertaking for invesco in 2019 was the completion of our acquisition of oppenheimerfunds and the integration of our two firms we view the combination as a multiyear growth story that deepened our relationships with clients in the us expanded the capabilities we can offer globally and further scaled our business for the benefit of clients and shareholders the firm is highly focused on delivering the additional capabilities achieved through the combination to the institutional and exus markets which we expect will help move our net flows in a positive direction as a result of the acquisition we are also better positioned to deliver strong outcomes for clients since overall performance rankings for us mutual funds are consistently stronger for the combined firm than for either firm independently 

during 2019 we further expanded and enhanced our ability to help certain of our intermediary distributors engage with their clients and improve their investment experience through the expansion of our digital wealth platform we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that we believe will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term 

we continued to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by making key acquisitions hiring worldclass talent further upgrading our technology platform launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and we will continue to bring the best of invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients some highlights of 2019 are as follows 



  

  

  

 participate in this technology 

   

taken together this work further expanded the broad range of capabilities invesco uses to create solutions that deliver the outcomes clients are seeking all wrapped in a robust valueadded client experience these initiatives also further strengthened the firm’s effectiveness and efficiency providing greater economies of scale that we believe will enable us to provide a higher level of value to clients and further improve our competitive position 

industry trends 

trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 



  

  

  

as a result of the trends discussed above clients are seeking to work with a smaller number of asset managers who can meet a comprehensive set of needs they want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives they also want greater value for their money which means competitive pricing investor education thought leadership digital platforms and other value added services that create an enhanced client experience these dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry and that we believe will drive increasing consolidation we believe the steps we have taken over the past decade and throughout 2019 strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure invesco is wellpositioned to compete and win within our industry 

other external factors impacting invesco 

invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of our peers as one of the leading investment managers in the uk and europe we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding brexit additionally our strong position in asia pacific meant that invesco was more affected than others by market uncertainties over the trade issues between china and the us 

although negotiations between the uk and eu resulted in the uk leaving the eu under the terms of the withdrawal agreement on january 31 2020 the longer term relationship between the uk and the eu is still uncertain this may affect the levels and composition of our aum and also negatively influence investor sentiment which could result in reduced or negative flows in addition because the uk pound sterling is the functional currency for certain of our subsidiaries any weakening of the uk pound sterling relative to the us dollar could negatively impact our reported financial results 

invesco is a global business and has been committed for many years to meeting clients’ needs across europe in both eu and noneu countries invesco has local teams of experts focused on servicing local clients and fund ranges in different countries to meet a variety of local country and regional client needs we currently have a presence in 12 member states across the eu excluding the uk employing over 440 staff our staff will be able to continue to reside and work across the relevant regions the change in the uks status from an eu to a noneu country will not change invesco’s focus or commitment to serve its clients across europe we have plans in place which will enable us to respond to a variety of different potential scenarios and we believe we are fully prepared to continue to operate and deliver for our clients with minimal disruption 

the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our client portfolios in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor benchmark after 2021 this announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 and it appears likely that libor will be phased out or the methodology for determining libor will be modified by 2021 changes in the method pursuant to which libor is determined or the discontinuance of libor may adversely affect the amount of interest payable or interest receivable on certain portfolio investments these changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments invesco is finalizing its global assessment of exposure in relation to funds utilizing libor based instruments and benchmarks and is prioritizing the mitigation of risks associated with the forecast changes to financial instruments and performance benchmarks referencing existing libor rates and concurrently any impact on invesco portfolios and investment strategies 

the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus may also impact invesco our operations and our employees the virus has spread internationally and global stock markets have reacted negatively and with increased volatility the market reaction may deepen further if the virus continues to spread but if and when the coronavirus is successfully contained the situation should normalize and financial markets will likely stabilize should the coronavirus spread without containment however the overall impact on the stock market may become more pronounced and may result in investors withdrawing from or delaying further investments in equity markets invescos significant presence in asia pacific may make invesco more vulnerable to the uncertainties surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the corresponding economic disruption in this region 

investment management capabilities 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives 

  

  

  

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from entities such as individual corporate clients insurance companies endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

the company operates as an integrated global investment manager presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world dedicated sales forces deliver our investment strategies through a variety of vehicles that meet the needs of retail and institutional clients note that not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are in retail vehicles and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are in institutional vehicles as described in the table below this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate 

  

  

  

the following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel 



retail 

retail aum were 8782 billion at december 31 2019  we offer retail products within all of the major asset classes our retail products are primarily distributed through thirdparty financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia 

the americas uk and emea exuk retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2019  invesco holds a leading position amongst retail fund providers in the uk invescos us retail business including our etf franchise is a top 10 asset manager in the us by longterm assets and invesco in emea exuk was among the largest nonproprietary investment managers in the retail channel invesco great wall was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with total aum of approximately 413 billion as of december 31 2019  we provide our retail clients with one of the industrys most robust and comprehensive product lines

aum diversification 

one of invescos greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class our distribution network has attracted assets of 72 retail and 28 institutional as of december 31 2019  by client domicile 28 of client aum are outside the us and we serve clients in more than 120 countries the following tables present a breakdown of aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class as of december 31 2019  additionally the fourth table below illustrates the split of our aum as passive and active passive aum include indexbased etfs unit investment trusts uits nonmanagement fee earning aum and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum years ended december 31 2019 in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  assets under management” section for additional information regarding the changes in aum 

  

  

  









  

  

  

employees 

as of december 31 2019  the company had 8821 employees across the globe  december 31 2018  7459  increases in 2019 relate primarily to the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds none of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the level of fees the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients typically may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach and process we believe a key factor in our ability to manage through all market cycles is our integrated approach to risk management risk management is embedded in our daily operating activities our daytoday decision making as well as our strategic planning process our risk management framework provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company broadly our approach includes two governance structures i our global performance and risk committee assesses core investment risks and ii our corporate risk management committee assesses strategic operational and all other business risks a network of business unit geographic and specific risk management committees under the auspices of the corporate risk management committee maintains an ongoing risk assessment management and monitoring process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risks existing and emerging in the various domains of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated our aum as of january 31 2020 were 12187 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or 

  

  

  

sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among client portfolios these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance relative or absolute of the client portfolios managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our client portfolios to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our aum or affect our sales and negatively impact our revenues and income 

our investment performance along with achieving and maintaining appropriate levels of distribution and client service is critical to the success of our business strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our products poor investment performance as compared to thirdparty benchmarks or competitive products has in the past led and could in the future lead to a decrease in sales of our products and stimulate redemptions from existing products generally lowering the overall level of aum and reducing the management fees we earn there is no assurance that past or present investment performance in our products will be indicative of future performance if we fail or appear to fail to address successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any poor investment performance we may be unsuccessful in reversing such under performance and our future business prospects would likely be negatively affected 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in many products investors remain attracted to lower fee passive products which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future 

  

  

  

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant declines in our revenues 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace or our aum and revenues our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from certain fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our client portfolios for example libor as well as other interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be benchmarks are the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented the us federal reserve based on the recommendations of the new york federal reserves alternative reference rate committee consisting of major derivative market participants and their regulators has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate sofr which is intended to replace us dollar libor and sofrbased investment products have been issued in the us proposals for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced or have already begun publication markets are slowly developing in response to these new rates and questions around liquidity in these rates and how to appropriately adjust these rates to eliminate any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain a significant concern for us and others in the marketplace it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from libor on certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold and any other assets or liabilities as well as contractual rights and obligations whose value is tied to libor the value or profitability of these products and instruments and our costs of operations may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products instruments and contracts are commercially accepted 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

  

  

  

we have incurred and will continue to incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not offset these costs 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of oppenheimerfunds there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the business will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time as part of the integration activities for the oppenheimerfunds business the company has identified a matter that involves a possible loss contingency related to the operations of the acquired business see part ii see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19 commitments and contingencies for additional information 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds we issued perpetual preferred stock having a value of approximately 4 billion which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and may limit our ability to fund other priorities 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds invesco issued approximately 4 billion of 59 fixed rate perpetual preferred stock to certain of oppenheimerfunds former shareholders this issuance may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of common shares in certain circumstances may increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions and will require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to make required dividend payments to preferred shareholders 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds we issued approximately 819 million common shares which could adversely impact our trading price upon resale of those common shares 

we issued approximately 819 million common shares in connection with the acquisition most of which are held by massachusetts mutual life insurance company massmutual the common shares held by massmutual are subject to an agreement not to sell those common shares for a period of two years following completion of the acquisition subject to early termination as well as to certain limitations on resales however massmutual may in the future sell these common shares in the open market or through secondary offerings if massmutual were to sell its equity stake in invesco or express an intention to sell the stake that action could have a significant impact on our common share trading price 

massmutual has the ability to significantly influence our business and massmutual’s interest in our business may be different from that of other shareholders 

massmutual is entitled to designate an individual to serve on our board so long as it beneficially owns at least i 10 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock or ii x 5 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and y 20 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our series a preferred shares additionally we are not permitted to take certain actions without the prior written approval of massmutual including making certain changes in our capital structure or our organizational documents adopting a shareholder rights plan or effectuating certain business combination transactions massmutual’s level of ownership and influence may make some transactions such as those involving mergers material share issuances or changes in control more difficult or impossible without the support of massmutual which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock the interests of massmutual may conflict with the interests of other shareholders 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions protect the privacy of clients employees and business partners data and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage any inaccuracies delays systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations subject us to client employee or business 

  

  

  

partner dissatisfaction and losses subject us to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions andor subject us to reputational harm 

our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems and facilities including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control further thirdparty service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us regarding cyberincidents 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of confidential data litigation and regulatory enforcement actions and reputational harm cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats although we seek to take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and seek to continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems which could materially harm our operations and reputation the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions including fines and penalties which could be material and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled investment management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients the market for skilled investment management professionals is highly competitive the market for investment professionals and other key personnel is at times characterized by the movement of these professionals among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits including equity and other forms of deferred compensation that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing 

  

  

  

advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future similarly particularly in the united states certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers if a material portion of our distributors were to substantially narrow their product offerings it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability more broadly in both retail and institutional channels intermediaries distribution firms and consultants are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms they do business with while this offers opportunities to the company to have broader and deeper relationships with firms that continue to do business with us it also poses risks of additional lost business if a particular entity chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with the company any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community do to any of the abovedescribed factors would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on the companys ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements new products often must be in the market place for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows increasingly clients and intermediaries are looking to investment mangers to be able to deliver investment outcomes tailored to particular circumstances and needs and to augment traditional investment management products and services with additional valueadded services the company has sought to make investment designed to enable it to meet these evolving expectation which the company believes it will need to meet in in order to maintain and grow its business a failure to continue to innovate to introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2019  the company had approximately 10744 million in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in costs or correction damage awards or regulatory fines and penalties against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements such as adherence to investment restrictions or limits that we are required to observe in the provision of our services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios such as registered funds a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements which could lead to fines and penalties against the company any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to seek to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a 

  

  

  

payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us registered funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason openend registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of other clients or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products irrespective of the performance of our products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us or the client portfolios we manage 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the client portfolios that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutions many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets such nonperformance could produce a financial loss for the company or the client portfolios we manage 

  

  

  

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a2stable bbbstable and apositive from moodys investor services moodys standard  poors ratings service sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to access additional financing management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding total debt of 20803 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to invesco ltd of 138625 million  the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory agreements performance fees represented 1022 million  or 17  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing our earnings to be more volatile 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’ earnings and business considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors 

  

  

  

including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this european subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences as of december 31 2019  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7536 million  complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or japanese yen among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism increased geopolitical unrest natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism acts of civil or international unrest or hostility natural disasters pandemic disease and manmade disasters within the united states and abroad as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets and reduced economic activity for example the spread of a new strain of coronavirus at the end of 2019 may impact global markets in asia the market reaction may deepen further if the virus spreads any of these events that adversely affect the global economy capital markets or specific international regional or domestic markets may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline and may have a materially negative impact on our financial results 

  

  

  

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

although we seek to foster a positive workplace culture have adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks we cannot ensure that our workplace culture or such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation could lead to costly regulatory inquiries fines andor sanctions and may cause our aum revenue and earning to decline 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate clients or distributors and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs if our 

  

  

  

third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us it could lead to operational and regulatory problems including with respect to certain of our products which could result in losses enforcement actions or reputational harm and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 85094 million and 73583 million  respectively at december 31 2019  we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to require registration or licenses limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business increase compliance costs andor impose additional capital requirements our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees further regulators across borders could coordinate actions against us as issues arise resulting in impacts on our business in multiple jurisdictions judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom subsidiaries operating in the european union eu are subject to various eu directives which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise implemented in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on our business while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector some will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies including investment managers while invesco does not believe that the these postcrisis developments have or will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so more broadly we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale or increases the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix our 

  

  

  

aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity 

the eu has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and generally have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states ongoing changes in the eu’s regulatory framework applicable to our business including changes related to brexit and any other changes in the composition of the eu’s member states may add further complexity to our global risks and operations 

developments under regulatory changes will or may include without limitation 



  

  

  

clearing arrangements restrictions on proprietary trading by certain financial institutions other conduct requirements and potentially new taxes or similar fees 

 

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on our business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or services impair the investment performance of our products or services or impact our product mix our aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19   commitments and contingencies ” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

  

insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability 

we face the inherent risk of liability related to claims from clients thirdparty vendors or others actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with operations failures which could include cyber incidents to help protect against these risks we purchase insurance in amounts and against potential liabilities that we consider appropriate where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable there can be no assurance however that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or if covered will not exceed coverage limits or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured and may increase significantly over relatively short periods in addition certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or coinsurance liability 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions  there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation  

the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the antitax avoidance directive atad from the european union eu are involved in much of the coordinated activity including 

 as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items  some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes  thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation  although the timing and methods of implementation vary  several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with  and in some cases exceeds the scope of  the oecds recommendations  this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as 

  

  

  

increase the potential for double taxation 

we continually assess the impact of various u  s  federal state and foreign legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries which could result in a material increase in our us federal state or foreign taxes we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company  including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity  

on june 21 2018 in south dakota v  wayfair inc wayfair the us supreme court overruled prior court decisions that had precluded states from imposing a sales and use tax collection obligation on sellers unless they had a physical presence in the state  the wayfair decision as expected has led to increased state nexus expansion as more states turn to economic nexus threshold laws and away from physical presence nexus tests  

the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act enacted on december 22 2017 significantly reformed the taxation of business entities and included changes to us federal tax rates significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and migrating from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system  regulations and guidance implementing the changes continue to be issued and therefore the ultimate impact of the 2017 tax act on our business and financial condition remains to be determined  

on october 21  2016  the united states treasury and the irs published final and temporary regulations under section 385 of the internal revenue code 385 regulations that target the inbound financing of a foreignparented multinational groups us  subsidiaries there continues to be no immediate impacts to the companys financial position as a result of the application of the 385 regulations however in the future they could limit our ability to efficiently finance or otherwise choose between debt and equity transactions with our us subsidiaries 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to both income and nonincome based taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which are subject to current and potentially future tax audits in these jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

the european commission continues to investigate certain tax rulings and beneficial regimes provided by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid the investigation was triggered by the oecd  beps action plan as well as the eus own agenda to tackle aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance  there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken including retroactive application 10 year period conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties while the company does not believe it has received state aid and is not a party to any investigation due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda 

  

  

  

company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director’s duties to that company the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our third amended and restated byelaws byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

  

  

  

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management has elected to apply the fast act modernization and simplification of regulation sk which provides the option to limit the discussion to the two most recent calendar years the discussion and analysis disclosed herein apply to material changes in the consolidated financial statements for 2019 and 2018 for the comparison of 2018 and 2017 see the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of the company’s 2018 annual report on form 10k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 22 2019 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

  

  

global financial markets in 2019 were strong despite periods of volatility throughout the year the year saw global policy uncertainty and rising trade barriers uncertainty in the economic environment and weaker industry production metrics at times in the year led the us fed and many other central banks to lower interest rates to support global growth despite this uncertainty the global economy grew at a modest pace the us economy grew in 2019 while the european economy slowed during the year japan’s economy expanded slightly while china’s economy grew at slightly lower levels than the prior year global inflation fell slightly in the year 

2019 was almost entirely positive for us equities despite the uncertainty throughout the year over future fed policy and concerns about trade tensions between the us and china the central bank cut rates three times in 2019 to counter concerns about inflation growth the sp 500 posted multiple alltime high closing price levels and finished the year up 289  

european markets were volatile in 2019 reacting to signs of weakening growth and tense trade talks but were similarly assisted by continued accommodative monetary policies from central banks the brexit debate continued within the uk weighing on uk equities the uk election in december brought political clarity also boosted by eased monetary policy the ftse 100 ended the year up 121  

japanese equities advanced in the year despite overall sentiment of a weakening economy and a difficult global trade environment the bank of japan maintained its accommodative monetary policy the nikkei 225 finished the period up 182  

emerging market stocks also gained during the period overcoming uncertainties over the uschina trade negotiations general easing of growth in china and a strong us dollar 

investors sought the relative safety of bonds amidst global growth concerns and geopolitical uncertainties the us aggregate bond index was higher by 87 for the year 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31 returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2019 and 2018  



the companys financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the us dollar as discussed in the foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations section and the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018  section below 

our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields 

invesco benefits from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of aum one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographic diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

on may 24 2019 the company completed the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds an investment management subsidiary of massmutual for 56 billion the strategic acquisition brings invesco’s total assets under management to approximately 12 

  

  

  

trillion further enhancing the company’s ability to meet client needs through its comprehensive range of highconviction active passive and alternative capabilities 

the highly complementary investment and distribution capabilities of invesco and oppenheimerfunds strengthen the combined organization’s ability to provide more relevant investment outcomes to an expanded number of institutional and retail clients in the us and around the globe both invesco’s and oppenheimerfunds’ clients benefit from the acquisition which incorporates oppenheimerfunds’ highperforming investment capabilities and its powerful us thirdparty distribution platform with invesco’s strong and diversified product lineup global presence and solutionsdriven client outreach we view this as a multiyear growth story that expands the capabilities we can offer globally while further scaling our business for the benefit of clients 

invesco has made significant progress toward the integration of the two firms through the combination of middle and back office location strategy and leveraging the scale of the global operating platform to date invesco has achieved 501 million in annualized net expense synergies related to integration of the oppenheimerfunds business which is in excess of our 475 million target and ahead of schedule transaction integration and restructuring costs related to the acquisition are expected to increase from the original projection as a result of expenses related to fund mergers that were not contemplated at close as well as incremental severance costs related to achieving increased net expense synergies the company also will continue to incur incremental noncash transaction integration and restructuring charges related to accelerated vesting of common sharebased awards for terminated employees and acceleration of depreciation for software and leasehold improvement assets as well as 120 million related to compensation payments to certain oppenheimerfunds employees which were funded by massmutual under the terms of the acquisition 

during the year the company purchased 6698 million of its common shares this amount reflects 500 million  258 common shares through forward contracts 1108 million of common shares repurchased in the market at cost  56 million common shares and 590 million  33 million common shares relating to purchases of common shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements at the time of common share vesting at december 31 2019  a balance of 7322 million remains available under the common share repurchase authorization approved by the board on july 22 2016 since announcing the 12 billion stock repurchase plan in october 2018 the company has repurchased 973 million of its common shares to date and is on target to repurchase the remaining 227 million by the first quarter of 2021 

invesco continues to demonstrate its commitment to supporting financial advisors with industry leading tools and resources such as jemstep our advisorpowered digital advice capability and intelliflo our advisorfocused digital platform the range of investment capabilities available through jemstep are broad across the firms active alternative and etf offerings additionally jemstep offers open architecture to help advisors provide customized solutions for clients as a marketleading provider of digital solutions jemstep continues to expand its capabilities and market presence and is an integral part of invescos growth strategy 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of consolidated investment products 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various retail mutual funds and similar entities private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products the company is required to consolidate certain of these managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1   accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10k report as consolidated investments products cip the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

  

  

  

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

 

to assess the impact of cip on the companys results of operations and balance sheet discussion refer to part ii item 8 financial statements note 20   consolidated investment products  the impact on the companys results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 was a reduction of 335 million  this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products 

wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and other income and expenses nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented

foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations 

a significant portion of our business is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling euro and japanese yen will impact our assets liabilities aum and reported revenues and expenses from period to period the assets liabilities and aum of foreign subsidiaries are translated at period end spot foreign currency exchange rates the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates for the relevant period 

the table below sets forth the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation of nonus dollar denominated asset liabilities and aum into us dollars 



the table below sets forth the average foreign exchange rates used for translation of nonus dollar denominated income including revenues and expenses into us dollars 



a comparison of period end spot rates between december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 shows a strengthening of the pound sterling and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar while the euro weakened which is reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased japanese yenbased and eurobased assets liabilities and aum into us dollars respectively 

a comparison of the average foreign exchange rates used for the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the year ended december 31 2018 shows a weakening of the pound sterling and the euro relative to the us dollar while the japanese yen strengthened which is reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased eurobased and japanese yen based revenue and expenses into us dollars respectively 

assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum include indexbased etfs unit investment trusts uits nonmanagement fee earning aum and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

nonmanagement fee earning aum includes nonmanagement fee earning etfs uit and product leverage the net flows in nonmanagement fee earning aum can be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to certain aum as longterm longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity we present net flows into money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

  

  

  

in the second quarter of 2019 the company changed the presentation of its aum the new presentation reflects the combination of the us and canada to form americas and continental europe to now be emea ex uk as part of the change in the presentation of aum the company made certain reclassifications between geographies asset classes and active and passive classifications to better reflect the underlying aum in the aum tables below all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation and reclassifications 

changes in aum were as follows  



1 the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds business on may 24 2019 added 2244 billion in aum at that date the acquisition of guggenheim investments etf business on april 6 2018 added 381 billion in aum at that date as of july 1 2018 we began including 100 of invesco great wall which added 95 billion in aum during the third quarter of 2018 the acquisition of the european etf business added 260 billion in aum in 2017 

2 gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum excluding invesco great wall aum prior to the third quarter 2018 management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments given the companys influence on invesco great wall a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle to obtain majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter of 2018 our share of the average aum in 2019 for our jvs in china was 356 billion  2018  162 billion  2017  85 billion  it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of our jvs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum because the revenues resulting from these aum are not presented in our operating revenues under us gaap our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income additionally the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from cip and our jvs in china however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the companys true effective fee rate from aum 



  

  

  

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows

revenue yield 

changes in our aum mix significantly impact our net revenue yield passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes and changes in the mix of products therefore have an impact on our net revenue yield additionally as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the us changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of us dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations section for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates 

i n the year ended december 31 2019 the net revenue yield was 403 basis points compared to 398 basis points in the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 05 basis points as a result of the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds aum increased 2244 billion during the second quarter of 2019 which was comprised of 2199 billion of active and 45 billion of passive aum increasing the proportion of active aum and positively impacting net revenue yield

additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period as discussed in the executive overview financial global markets were strong and returns from capital markets were up in the year ended december 31 2019

see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the impact of changes in aum on management fee yields

performance fees 

of our 12262 billion in aum at december 31 2019  approximately 485 billion or 40  could potentially earn performance fees including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts of our 8882 billion in aum at december 31 2018 approximately 460 billion or 52  could potentially earn performance fees including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts

invesco great wall 

the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture management believes that the net revenues from invesco great wall should be added to total operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that invesco great wall is making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

prior to the third quarter 2018 management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from invesco great wall given the company’s influence on the invesco great wall joint venture a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching agreement in principle to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter 2018 as a result of this change the company’s nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

  

  

  

net revenues from invesco great wall were 1572 million and average aum was 356 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  reflecting 100 of the flows and aum for the year the aum increases are a result of significant growth in the china money market funds and therefore resulted in higher revenues 

net revenues from invesco great wall were 836 million and average aum was 162 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  reflecting 100 of the flows and aum for the six months ended december 31 2018 and 49 of the flows and aum for the six months ended june 30 2018 

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip increased by 49 million to 335 million in the year ended december 31 2019 year ended december 31 2018  286 million  the increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from clos

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the 

companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2019 resulted in a net decrease to net income attributable to invesco ltd of 16 million year ended december 31 2018  88 million net increase 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of nonclo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per common share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders similarly any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos offsetting in other gainslosses of cip and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per common share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate aum 

income before taxes

schedule of nongaap information 

we utilize the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and adjusted diluted earnings per common share eps the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors these measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income operating margin net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below

 prior to the third quarter 2018 management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments given the companys influence on invesco great wall a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle in the third quarter of 2018 to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall also beginning in the third quarter of 2018 the companys nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

  

  

  

 the company has changed its presentation of the reconciliation between operating revenues and net revenues all periods have been conformed to the new presentation neither operating revenues nor net revenues have changed for any historic periods 

management believes that adjustments to investment management fees service and distribution fees and other revenues from operating revenues appropriately reflect these revenues as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these adjustments vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

investment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fundrelated costs other is primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties while the terms used for these types of adjustments vary by geography they are all costs that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these revenues and expenses gross under us gaap on the consolidated statements of income 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20  “ consolidated investment products ” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

  

cip revenue 



 the transaction integration and restructuring charges reflect legal regulatory advisory valuation and other professional services or consulting fees and travel costs related to a business combination transaction or restructuring initiatives related to changes in business strategy also included in these charges are severancerelated expenses and any contract termination costs associated with these efforts additionally these charges reflect the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction or initiative and the postclosing costs of amortizing acquired intangible assets and integrating an acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings following a business combination or restructuring initiative 

  

  

  

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and restructuring related charges see results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018  transaction integration and restructuring for additional details 

5 market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities 

certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically managed by the company invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through total return swap financial instruments us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation depreciation are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares or swaps will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

see below for a reconciliation of deferred compensation related items 



  

  

  

6 other reconciling items 

each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 

 



  

  

  

dollar foreign exchange rates the pound sterling contracts provide coverage through june 30 2020 and the euro contracts provided coverage through december 27 2017 the adjustment from us gaap to nongaap earnings removes the impact of market volatility therefore the companys nongaap results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating as of the filing of this report invesco held credit ratings of a2stable bbbstable and apositive from moodys sp and fitch ratings respectively our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu and uk subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable eu and uk requirements including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this european subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2019  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7536 million  december 31 2018  7202 million  the increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of the pound sterling against the us dollar the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 8470 million at december 31 2019  december 31 2018  9967 million

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions as of december 31 2019  our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is 10490 million  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  no te 21  “ related parties ” for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds 

  

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

  

  

  

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 20803 million in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2019  



 

 

 

included in the table above is an additional operating lease the company entered into during the third quarter of 2019 but has not yet commenced the expected lease obligations are approximately 2325 million which will be paid over an expected lease term of 15 years  this operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2022 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 14  “operating leases” for sublease information 

   

  

  

  

during the year ended december 31 2019  the company entered into three forward contracts to repurchase 5000 million of shares as part of its announced 12 billion common stock buyback program at december 31 2019 the payable was  4965 million and is included in other liabilities see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 10  “ share capital ” for additional details 

 

 

 

7 in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above and pursuant to an agreement entered into at the consummation of the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds massmutual as the holder of seed capital investments in certain funds and accounts included in the acquisition has the right to redeem its seed capital investments in accordance with an agreed upon schedule in the event massmutual exercises its redemption rights and the applicable fund or account is unable to meet such redemption for example due to illiquid investments or the need to maintain a level of investment in the fund the company would be required to fund such redemption to massmutual and seek reimbursement from the applicable fund or account at a later time when the fund or account is able to fulfill a redemption request at december 31 2019 the total amount of seed capital subject to this agreement is approximately 625 million since december 31 2019 massmutual exercised its redemption rights and redeemed a portion of the seed capital per the agreed upon schedule as of the date of this report the company was not required to fund these redemptions nor does the company anticipate having to fund any of the seed capital subject to this agreement 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2019 and 2018 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeded its carrying value during 2019  the optional qualitative approach indicated that a quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary whereas during 2018 management elected to proceed directly to a quantitative goodwill impairment test the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 85094 million and 71571 million at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related effective fee rates 

  

  

  

when management utilizes the option to first assess goodwill impairment on a qualitative basis the totality of certain events and circumstances are assessed to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance of the company and or significant changes in share price if the qualitative assessment indicates that an impairment may be likely or management elected to not perform the qualitative assessment management performs a quantitative test to determine the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates projected effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates 

the quantitative test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains or losses and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis similar to goodwill management has the option to first assess indefinitelived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset in addition managements judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 527 million  297 million and 174 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if a quantitative assessment is required the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess if required fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix projected effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions during 2019 and 2018  our annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

in may 2019 the company acquired massmutuals asset management affiliate oppenheimerfunds for total consideration of approximately 56 billion comprised of cash and stock the resulting synergy further enhances the company’s ability to meet client needs through its comprehensive range of highconviction active passive and alternative capabilities 

management applied a significant amount of judgment when developing the fair value measurement of the management fee contracts intangible assets fair value was determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows were discounted to arrive at present value amounts see note 1  “ accounting policies ” and note 2  “ business combination ” to the consolidated financial statements for further information surrounding the estimates of identified assets acquired liabilities assumed and consideration transferred also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the company’s acquisition policy 

the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including but not limited to i the future aum growth rates for different product categories and their related net flows and market appreciation ii projected effective fee rates iii pretax profit margins iv the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets and v discount rate

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity a vie in the context of the company and its managed funds is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the funds economic performance and the obligation to absorb lossesright to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund then the company is deemed to be the funds primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2019  the company consolidated cip that held investments of 78080 million  december 31 2018  62135 million  

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business 

recent accounting standards 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies  accounting pronouncements recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 



  

  

  

 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values or the market inputs contributing to the fair value of these financial instruments 



 



  

  

  

losses net in the consolidated statements of income if a 10 increase or decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability were to occur it would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our net income attributable to invesco ltd 

cash balances invested in money market funds of 6209 million have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 108356 million have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2019  the interest rates on 1000 of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 79 years and the company had a balance of zero on its floating rate credit facility 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31 was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 9  “longterm debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the companys fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2019  include foreign time deposit investments of 320 million  2018  281 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 046  2018  046  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 02 years  2018  02 years 

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18  geographic information contains disclosure of revenue from external customers by geography the disclosure of revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling 

given this exposure the company continued to hedge this risk through outofthe money put option contracts to hedge economically the foreign currency risk on the translation of its pound sterlingdenominated earnings into us dollars through june 30 2020  these programs may serve to reduce but not fully eliminate the impact of pound sterling foreign currency risk and the impact on our consolidated income statements the pound sterlingus dollar contracts have a strike price set at 125 based on the average daily foreign exchange rates for the applicable time period other than the fair value of the put 

  

  

  

option contracts there is no additional loss exposure to the company only the potential for a gain should the average exchange rates fall below the strike levels during the hedged periods at december 31 2019  a 10 decline in the annual average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would result in a positive cash flow from the pound sterlingus dollar contracts of 43 million 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation losses were 136 million in 2019  2018  42 million of gains and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation and have put in place net investment hedge structures discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements note 11 other comprehensive incomeloss

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on may 24 2019 the company acquired massmutual’s asset management affiliate oppenheimerfunds consistent with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting related to certain oppenheimerfunds revenue processes due to the ongoing transition of middle and backoffice transaction processing systems accordingly a portion of the acquired revenue was excluded from evaluation which represented approximately 17 of the companys total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 the company will complete integration of oppenheimerfunds into its internal control over financial reporting during 2020

strategy 

the company focuses on four key longterm strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 



  

  

  

 

as an integrated global investment manager we are keenly focused on meeting clients needs and operating effectively and efficiently as an integrated global organization we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

we believe one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm 

2018 developments 

throughout 2018 we made solid progress in several areas that will help us better meet client needs further strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term at the same time 2018 was a challenging year for the asset management industry and for invesco we saw volatile markets throughout the year and particularly during the fourth quarter these market headwinds combined with underperformance in certain investment capabilities and challenges in the global markets in which we operate  such as the uncertainties surrounding brexit and the trade war between the us and china  led to negative net flows for the firm in 2018 after nine consecutive years of positive net flows 

during 2018 we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term we continued to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by making or agreeing to make certain acquisitions hiring worldclass talent upgrading our technology platform launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary we believe the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and we will continue to bring the best of invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients some highlights of 2018 are as follows 



  

  

  

   

taken together this work further expanded the broad range of capabilities invesco uses to create solutions that deliver the outcomes clients are seeking all wrapped in a robust valueadded client experience these initiatives also further strengthen the firm’s effectiveness and efficiency providing greater economies of scale that will enable us to provide a higher level of value to clients and further improve our competitive position

industry trends 

 trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 



  

  

  

 

as a result of the trends discussed above clients are seeking to work with a smaller number of asset managers who can meet a comprehensive set of needs they want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives they also want greater value for their money which means competitive pricing investor education thought leadership digital platforms and other value added services that create an enhanced client experience these dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry and that we believe will drive increasing consolidation we believe the steps we have taken over the past decade and throughout 2018 strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure invesco is wellpositioned to compete and win within our industry

other external factors impacting invesco 

invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of our peers as one of the leading investment managers in the uk and europe we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding brexit additionally our strong position in asia pacific meant that invesco was more affected than others by market uncertainties over the trade issues between china and the us 

in 2016 the uk electorate voted to leave the european union withdrawal is schedule to occur on march 29 2019 at this time the terms of the withdrawal and the uks future relationship with the eu are not agreed if the withdrawal treaty is agreed in time invesco would be able to operate on a businessasusual basis during a transitional period while the full details of the uks future relationship with the eu become defined however if the uk leaves the eu on mach 29 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place there would be considerable uncertainty including uncertainty about continuing trade between the uk and the eu on january 30 2019 eu27 national regulators reached agreement with the uk’s financial conduct authority to ensure the continued practice of “delegation” in the event of a brexit without a withdrawal agreement in place delegation allows funds to continue to be managed in the uk while being domiciled in another eu country this agreement will prevent disruption for fund groups and help in brexit contingency planning which will help maintain market stability in the eu and ensure investor protection there may be some disruption for nonfund accounts 

the uk economy has been in a period of uncertainty with volatility expected in financial markets until the terms of withdrawal are agreed upon we believe uncertainty in the markets was a factor in the decline in aum within our uk operations where aum from clients domiciled in the uk were 851  billion at december 31 2018 december 31 2017 1109  billion at december 31 2018 approximately 6 of our aum are uk entities providing investment services to eubased fund management subsidiaries and eubased clients most of this activity is anticipated to be able to continue even if a formal uk exit agreement is not reached 

invesco is a global business and has been committed for many years to meeting clients’ needs across europe in both eu and noneu countries invesco has local teams of experts focused on servicing local clients and fund ranges in different countries to meet a variety of local country and regional client needs we currently have a presence in 11 member states across the eu excluding the uk employing over 370 staff our staff will be able to continue to reside and work across the relevant regions the change in the uks status from an eu to a noneu country will not change invesco’s focus or commitment to serve its clients across europe we have plans in place which will enable us to respond to a variety of different potential scenarios and we believe we are fully prepared to continue to operate and deliver for our clients with minimal disruption 

investment management capabilities 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent 

  

  

  

investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives 

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from entities such as individual corporate clients insurance companies endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

the company operates as an integrated global investment manager presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world this is supported with the crossselling of investment capabilities globally and integrated internal sales forces as a result the companys retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types therefore not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are retail products and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are institutional products this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the level of fees the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach we believe a key factor in invescos ability to manage through all market cycles is our integrated approach to risk management invesco’s enterprise risk management approach is embedded its management decisionmaking processes across the organization and provides a consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business and operational risks with coordination between the two 

 

further a network of functional geographic and specific risk management committees under the guidance and standards of the corporate risk management committee maintain ongoing risk assessment management and monitoring processes that provide a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated approximately 43  of our total aum were invested in the equity asset class and approximately 57  were invested in the fixed income asset 

  

  

  

class and other asset classes at december 31 2018  our aum as of january 31 2019  were 9306 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among client portfolios these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance relative or absolute of the client portfolios managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our client portfolios to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries or could limit or reduce sales of our products all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in many products investors remain attracted to lower fee passive products which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

  

  

  

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from certain fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

the manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our client portfolios for example libor as well as other interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be benchmarks are the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated changes in the method pursuant to which libor is determined or the discontinuance of libor may adversely affect the amount of interest payable or interest receivable on certain portfolio investments these changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

combining oppenheimerfunds may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized 

in october 2018 invesco entered into a definitive agreement to acquire oppenheimerfunds from massmutual invesco and oppenheimerfunds have operated and until the completion of the acquisition will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients distributors employees and others or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition if we experience difficulties with the integration process and attendant systems conversions including due to the failure of critical thirdparty service providers we may adversely impact client or distribution relationships this could result in the loss of assets under management or prevent or delay our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition integration efforts between the two companies will also divert significant management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on either company during this transition period and on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the acquisition 

invesco and oppenheimerfunds will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the acquisition is pending 

uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on invesco and oppenheimerfunds these uncertainties may impair the ability of both of us to attract retain and motivate key personnel 

  

  

  

until the acquisition is completed and could cause clients and others that deal with invesco or oppenheimerfunds to seek to change existing business relationships 

the oppenheimerfunds business may lose clients as a result of the acquisition 

 under the investment company act of 1940 each of the investment advisory agreements for oppenheimerfundsadvised us mutual funds that are registered as “investment companies” under the investment company act will automatically terminate as a result of the acquisition and the investment advisory agreements of other oppenheimerfunds clients may also terminate if the parties fail to obtain the approval of such other clients for the continuation of such agreements following the acquisition under the merger agreement the parties agreed to seek the consent of other clients to the continuation of their advisory agreements following the acquisition it is a condition to completing the acquisition that the parties obtain other client approvals reflecting as of shortly prior to closing annualized revenues of at least 75 of the amounts calculated before the signing of the merger agreement with all revenue calculations adjusted to eliminate the impact of market and currency movements and the purchase price is subject to adjustment if the shortfall exceeds a certain threshold no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the necessary approvals and consents and the decrease in revenue that could result from a failure to obtain such approvals even if the closing condition is satisfied and the purchase price impact taken into account could have an adverse effect on our business and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the acquisition may not be completed 

the merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the acquisition those conditions include among others 1 certain regulatory approvals 2 absence of injunctions prohibiting the completion of the acquisition 3 approval from the new york stock exchange for the listing of our common shares to be issued as part of the acquisition consideration 4 adoption by us of a certificate of designation for the preferred shares to be issued as part of the acquisition consideration 5 subject to certain materiality thresholds the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the other party 6 material compliance by such other party with its respective obligations under the merger agreement and 7 the revenue runrate as of shortly prior to the closing of the acquisition being at least equal to 75 of the revenue runrate as of shortly prior to the signing of the merger agreement additionally massmutual’s obligation to complete the transaction is subject to the receipt of a favorable opinion from its counsel regarding certain tax matters these conditions to the closing of the acquisition may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the acquisition may not be completed in addition the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time and each of us may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances 

we will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds 

we expect to incur significant nonrecurring costs in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds in addition we will incur integration costs following the completion of the acquisition as we integrate the oppenheimerfunds business and systems with our own businesses and systems there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the business will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time see the risk factor entitled “combining oppenheimerfunds may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized”   above we will also incur significant legal accounting and other advisor fees including in connection with our efforts to seek the approval of the oppenheimerfunds clients to the transaction some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the acquisition is completed 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds we will issue perpetual preferred stock having a value of approximately 4 billion which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and may limit our ability to fund other priorities 

in connection with the acquisition invesco will issue approximately 4 billion of 59 fixed rate perpetual preferred stock to the current shareholders of oppenheimerfunds this issuance may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of common shares in certain circumstances may increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions and will require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to make distributions 

in connection with the acquisition of oppenheimerfunds we will issue approximately 819 million common shares which could adversely impact our trading price upon resale of those shares 

  we will issue approximately 819 million common shares in connection with the acquisition most of which will be held by massmutual the shares held by massmutual will be subject to an agreement not to sell those shares for a period 

  

  

  

of two years following completion of the acquisition subject to early termination as well as to certain limitations on resales however massmutual may in the future sell these shares in the open market or through secondary offerings if massmutual were to sell its future equity stake in invesco or express an intention to sell the stake that action could have a significant impact on our common share trading price 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions protect the privacy of clients employees and business partners data and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage any inaccuracies delays systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations subject us to client employee or business partner dissatisfaction and losses andor subject us to reputational harm 

our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems and facilities including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control further thirdparty service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us regarding cyberincidents 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of confidential data and reputational harm cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats although we take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems which could materially harm our operations and reputation the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions including fines and penalties which could be material and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has become more so in periods of growth of the investment management industry the market for investment professionals and other key personnel is at times 

  

  

  

characterized by the movement of these professionals among different firms   our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits including equity and other forms of deferred compensation that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future similarly particularly in the united states certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers if a material portion of our distributors were to substantially narrow their product offerings it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on the companys ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements new products often must be in the market place for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows a failure to continue to innovate to introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2018  the company had approximately 9831 million  in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements that we are required to observe in the provision of our services laws and 

  

  

  

regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios such as registered funds a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us registered funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason openend registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us continuously to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of other clients or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

  

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the client portfolios that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutions many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets 

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a2stable bbbstable and apositive  from moodys investor services moodys standard  poors ratings service sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to access additional financing management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding total debt of 24088 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to invesco ltd of 85788 million  the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 569 million  or 11  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not 

  

  

  

earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing our earnings to be more volatile 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’  earnings and business considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences  as of december 31 2018  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7202 million  complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility both within the united states and abroad as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets loss of life property damage disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy capital markets or specific international regional or domestic markets may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

  

  

  

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

we have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business however we cannot be assured that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate clients or distributors and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs if our third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us it could lead to operational and regulatory problems including with respect to certain of our products which could result in losses enforcement actions or reputational harm and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 71571 million  and 21761 million  respectively at december 31 2018  we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

  

  

  

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business increase compliance costs andor impose additional capital requirements our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom subsidiaries operating in the european union eu are subject to various eu directives which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise implemented in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on our business while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector some will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies including investment managers while invesco does not believe that the these postcrisis developments have or will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so more broadly we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale or increases the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity 

  

  

  

the eu has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and generally have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states ongoing changes in the eu’s regulatory framework applicable to our business including changes related to brexit and any other changes in the composition of the eu’s member states may add further complexity to our global risks and operations 

developments under regulatory changes will or may include without limitation 



  

  

  

 

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on our business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products impair the investment performance of our products or impact our product mix our aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18   commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the antitax avoidance directive atad from the european union eu are involved in much of the coordinated activity as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecds recommendations this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as increase the potential for double taxation 

  

  

  

in 2018 the eu introduced mandatory disclosure rules dac6 requiring disclosure to tax authorities of crossborder arrangements entered into by taxpayers that fall within certain broadly defined hallmarks there also are separate transitional rules that require separate reporting for any disclosable transactions occurring after the june 25 2018 effective date on july 1 2018 the oecd enacted the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the multilateral instrument or mli the mli implements several beps initiatives action 2  hybrid mismatch arrangements action 6  treaty abuse action 7  definition of permanent establishment and action 14  mutual agreement procedures map as well as arbitration additionally a few eu countries have enacted or proposed a tax on digital services in response to an inability to agree on an eu wide proposal 

we continually assess the impact of various us federal state and foreign legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries which could result in a material increase in our us federal state or foreign taxes we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

on june 21 2018 in south dakota v wayfair inc wayfair the us supreme court overruled prior court decisions that had precluded states from imposing a sales and use tax collection obligation on sellers unless they had a physical presence in the state the wayfair   decision is expected to increase state nexus expansion as more states turn to economic nexus threshold laws and away from physical presence nexus tests 

the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act enacted on december 22 2017 significantly reformed the taxation of business entities the new legislation among other things includes changes to us federal tax rates imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest allows for the expensing of capital expenditures and puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system the scope and breadth of the changes and the volume of regulations and guidance issued to date and yet to be issued means the ultimate impact of the 2017 tax act on our business and financial condition remains to be determined 

on october 21 2016 the united states treasury and the irs published final and temporary regulations under section 385 of the internal revenue code 385 regulations that target the inbound financing of a foreignparented multinational groups us subsidiaries there are no immediate impacts to the companys financial position as a result of the application of the 385 regulations however in the future they could limit our ability to efficiently finance or otherwise choose between debt and equity transactions with our us subsidiaries 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

the european commission continues to investigate certain tax rulings and beneficial regimes provided by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid the investigation was triggered by the oecd  beps action plan as well as the eus own agenda to tackle aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken including retroactive application 10 year period conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties while the company does not believe it has received state aid and is not a party to any investigation due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

  

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director’s duties to that company the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our second amended and restated byelaws byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any 

  

  

  

federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm has advised us that it identified an issue related to an independence requirement contained in the securities exchange act of 1934 regulations regarding auditor independence 

in may 2016 pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc advised the company that it had identified an issue related to its independence under rule 201c1iia of regulation sx loan rule with respect to certain of pwc’s lenders who own certain invesco registered funds managed by certain of our whollyowned investment adviser subsidiaries the company and such funds are required to have their financial statements audited by a public accounting firm that qualifies as independent under various sec rules 

the loan rule prohibits accounting firms such as pwc from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities specifically the loan rule provides in relevant part that an accounting firm is not independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a “record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client’s equity securities” for purposes of the loan rule audit clients include all of the registered investment companies advised by affiliates of the company as well as the company and its other subsidiaries collectively the invesco funds complex for which pwc also serves as independent auditor pwc informed the company it has relationships with lenders who hold as record owner more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the invesco fund complex these relationships call into question pwc’s independence under the loan rule with respect to those funds as well as all other funds in the invesco fund complex and the company and its subsidiaries 

in june 2016 the sec staff issued a “noaction” letter to another mutual fund complex see fidelity management  research company et al noaction letter  related to the audit independence issue described above in that letter the sec staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an audit client that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the loan rule in certain specified circumstances the circumstances described in the noaction letter are substantially similar to the circumstances that called into question pwc’s independence under the loan rule with respect to the invesco funds complex including the company the company therefore believes that the invesco funds complex can rely on the letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by pwc and we intend to do so in september 2017 the sec staff issued a letter extending the relief in the june 2016 noaction letter referenced above the extension makes no changes to the circumstances in the original noaction letter and does not include a new expiration date providing indefinite relief 

if in the future the independence of pwc is called into question under the loan rule by circumstances that are not addressed in the sec staff’s noaction letter the company will need to take other action and incur additional costs in order for the company’s filings with the sec containing financial statements to be deemed compliant with applicable 

  

  

  

securities laws such action may include obtaining the review and audit of the financial statements filed by the company by another independent registered public accounting firm in addition under such circumstances the company’s eligibility to issue securities under its existing registration statements on form s3 and forms s8 may be impacted and certain financial reporting covenants with our lenders may be impacted there could be other burdensome requirements or impacts on other entities including registered funds included in the invesco funds complex such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability 

we face the inherent risk of liability related to claims from clients thirdparty vendors or others actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with cyber incidents to help protect against these risks we purchase insurance in amounts and against potential liabilities that we consider appropriate where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable there can be no assurance however that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or if covered will not exceed coverage limits or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured and may increase significantly over relatively short periods in addition certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or coinsurance liability

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

global financial markets in 2018  saw a return of market volatility and significant negative returns late in the year wiped out earlier gains in all markets the year started much as the prior year had ended with strong returns fueled by optimism around us tax reform and positive macroeconomic data however increasing geopolitical uncertainty and rising global trade tensions as well as concerns about the sustainability of global growth came into sharper focus as the year progressed ultimately leading markets lower 

  

  

  

in the us strong earnings growth and employment data helped to propel the markets higher to start the year while the accelerating potential for negative trade actions between the us and china and concerns that the us may be late in an economic cycle dampened market enthusiasm as the year progressed the federal reserve’s interest rate actions throughout the year and unwind of the accommodative monetary policy created further uncertainty as they continued to raise interest rates while indicating that future pace of increases could be slowed or curtailed the sp 500 reached an alltime high in september before contracting sharply in the fourth quarter to finish the year down 70  

european markets were similarly lifted early in the year on strong economic data and an improving growth outlook the sentiment turned negative as the year progressed as rising geopolitical concerns including the upcoming uk and eu separation italian political concerns and the ongoing trade tensions between the us and china and concerns around global growth intensified driving the ftse 100 down 124  for the year 

in japan a positive economic outlook and weakening yen were offset by a slowdown in china’s growth and concerns about the impact to corporate profits led markets sharply lower late in the year the nikkei 225 finished the year down 121  

bond returns for the year were mixed as strong economic indicators and rate increases implemented in the us and uk drove yields higher for a majority of the year while the desire for lowerrisk assets in the fourth quarter pressured yields on government bonds concerns around liquidity and leverage and a weakening outlook for corporate profits negatively impacted corporate investment grade and highyield credit driving the us aggregate bond index to finish down a modest 02  for the year 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2018  2017  and 2016  



the companys financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the us dollar as discussed in the foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations section and the   results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  compared to december 31 2017  compared to december 31 2016  section below 

our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields 

invesco benefits from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of aum one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographic diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels the company has moved to a unified brand  invesco while preserving the timetested and distinctive investment perspectives processes and approaches of our different investment teams across the globe this effort will contribute to a more consistent client experience across multiple markets and strengthen our ability to market our comprehensive range of capabilities more effectively 

as announced in october 2018 invesco and massmutual have entered into a definitive agreement whereby invesco will acquire massmutual’s asset management affiliate oppenheimerfunds inc in turn massmutual and the oppenheimerfunds employee shareholders will receive a combination of common and preferred equity consideration and massmutual will become a significant shareholder of invesco with an approximate 17 stake expected at closing  the transaction is on track to close in the second 

  

  

  

quarter of 2019 pending necessary regulatory and other thirdparty approvals this strategic combination of highly complementary investment and distribution capabilities will strengthen the combined organization’s ability to provide relevant investment outcomes to an expanded number of institutional and retail clients in the us and around the globe 

under the terms of the agreement invesco will acquire oppenheimerfunds with consideration to massmutual and oppenheimerfunds employee shareholders consisting of 819 million shares of invesco common equity and 4 billion in perpetual noncumulative preferred shares with a 21year noncall period and a fixed rate of 59 based on invesco’s stock price as of december 31 2018 this represents an estimated purchase price of 54 billion the purchase and sale agreement contain customary purchase price adjustments related to net working capital and revenue run rate changes at the closing date as of the date of this report no such adjustment to the purchase price would be triggered the purchase and sale agreement does not contain an adjustment to the purchase price based upon changes in the market valuation of aum 

since announcement invesco and oppenheimerfunds have made significant progress toward achieving the postclose integration and targeted expense synergies of 475 million through a planned combination of middle and backoffice rationalization location strategy and leveraging the scale of the global operating platform as noted in october bringing the two firms together will accelerate invesco’s growth strategy and further strengthen our ability to meet client needs across the globe 

in october 2018 the company announced a common stock buyback program of 12 billion to be completed within the next two years which will be financed through the strong operating cash flows of the combined invesco and oppenheimerfunds organization for the purpose of repurchasing its shares the company entered into a forward contract during the fourth quarter of 2018 under this contract the counterparty purchased 300 million 144 million shares of the companys shares in the fourth quarter the shares are included as treasury shares in the companys balance sheet and reduced outstanding shares as of december 3 2018 the company intends to repurchase an additional 100300 million prior to the closing of the oppenheimerfunds acquisition depending on market conditions with the remainder to be purchased by the end of 2020

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability

 assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum include indexbased etfs unit investment trusts uits nonmanagement fee earning aum foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates  active aum is total aum less passive aum 

nonmanagement fee earning aum includes invesco qqq uits and product leverage the net flows in nonmanagement fee earning aum can be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as longterm longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

  

  

  

changes in aum were as follows    





  

  

  

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

average aum during the year ended december 31 2018  were 9587 billion  compared to 8750 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017   december 31 2016  7888 billion  

market returns and reinvested distributions 

market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis during 2018  global markets saw a return of market volatility and significant negative returns late in the year wipe out earlier gains in all markets see below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on aum 

foreign exchange rates 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we experienced decreases  in aum of  125 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates  december 31 2017  aum increased  by 214 billion  december 31 2016  aum decreased by 221 billion  see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2018  in the “foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations” section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates 

acquisitions and dispositions 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we completed the acquisition of guggenheim investments etf business which added 381 billion in aum at date of purchase and we began including 100 of invesco great wall fund management company which added 95 billion in aum during the year for the year ended december 31 2017  we completed the acquisition of the european etf business which added 260 billion in passive etf aum including approximately 70 billion of externally managed aum at date of purchase for the year ended december 31 2016  dispositions of 27 billion related to the deconsolidation of certain securitization trusts by invesco mortgage capital inc ivr and other aum dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of the controlling interest of invesco asset management india private limited which added 24 billion to aum 

revenue yield 

as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the us changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of us dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations section for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates 

additionally changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes the acquisitions of the european etf business in the third quarter of 2017 and the guggenheim etf acquisition in april 2018 increased the level of passive aum and have a dilutive impact on the companys overall net revenue yield the company has experienced greater outflows from active aum as compared to outflows from passive aum increasing the proportion of passive to active aum during the year ended december 31 2018  

 at december 31 2018  passive aum were 2210 billion  representing 249  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2017  passive aum were 1990 billion  representing 212  of our total aum at that date  december 31 2016  1444 billion   178  in the year ended december 31 2018  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 149  basis points compared to 163  basis points in the year ended december 31 2017  a decrease  of 14  basis points  december 31 2016  153

revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from invesco great wall 

management believes that the revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from invesco great wall should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that invesco great wall is making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

prior to the third quarter 2018 management reflected its 49  interest in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from invesco great wall given the companys influence on the invesco great wall joint venture a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall beginning in the third quarter the companys nongaap operating results now reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from invesco great wall were 836 million  and average aum was 162 billion  for the year ended   december 31 2018  reflecting 100 of the flows and aum for the six months ended december 31 2018 and 49 of the flows and aum for the six months ended june 30 2018

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased  by 38 million  to 286 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  year ended december 31 2017  324 million  the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in management fees earned from clos 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip increased by 101 million  to 324 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  year ended december 31 2016  223 million  the increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from clos

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

    the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the 

companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2018  resulted in an net increase  to net income attributable to invesco ltd of 88 million  year ended december 31 2017    23 million   net increase the consolidation of investment products during the year ended   december 31 2016   resulted in an increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd of   30 million    

  

  

  

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of nonclo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders similarly any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos offsetting in other gainslosses of cip and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate aum 

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes incomelosses of cip however the companys operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under us gaap as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation therefore total us and foreign income before taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 15  taxation which includes incomelosses from cip and us and foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information in which cip has been eliminated may not correlate the table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of cip is separately stated so that the impact of cip is evident 

total us income before taxes decreased   1467 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  to 4918 million  from 6385 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  and includes us income of cip of 189 million   december 31 2017  01 million  us income from cip increased   188 million  from 2017  due primarily to the impact of gains on consolidated private equity partnerships and certain other consolidated funds excluding cip us income before taxes in 2018   decreased   1655 million   259  from december 31 2017  due to a larger decrease in us operating revenues than operating expenses 

total foreign income before taxes decreased   1444 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  to 6463 million  from 7907 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  and includes foreign loss of cip of 98 million   december 31 2017  foreign income of cip of 359 million  foreign income from cip decreased   457 million  due primarily to losses on consolidated funds including the impact of newly consolidated funds in 2018  excluding cip foreign income decreased  by 987 million   131  from 2017  due to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses 

total us income before taxes increased   986 million  to 6385 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  from 5399 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  and includes us income of cip of 01 million   december 31 2016  24 million  us income of cip decreased   23 million   958  from 2016   due primarily to the impact of private equity partnerships excluding cip us income before taxes in 2017   increase d  1009 million   188  from december 31 2016  due to a larger increase in us operating revenues than operating expenses

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018  increased to 224  year ended december 31 2017  188  the increase primarily reflects a 1307 million tax benefit 93 in 2017 related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 tax act enacted in the united states partially offset by a 60 rate reduction in 2018 as a result of the lower federal tax rate effective january 1 2018 

the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests increased our rate periodoverperiod by 05   no  change in the effective tax rate in 2018  and 05  decrease to the effective tax rate in 2017    see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15  taxation for further details and additional discussion on the amounts recorded for the 2017 tax act

2017 tax act enacted in the united states the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests decreased our rate periodoverperiod by 02 05 decrease to the effective tax rate in 2017 and 03 decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016 the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income 

schedule of nongaap information 

we utilize the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors these measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income operating margin net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to a nongaap basis of net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation adjusted diluted eps these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any us gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates notes to the reconciliations follow the tables

 invesco great wall is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of 269 billion as of december 31 2018 the company has a 49 interest in invesco great wall  enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

prior to the third quarter 2018 management reflected its interests in invesco great wall on a proportional consolidation basis which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the aum from these investments given the companys influence on invesco great wall a change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and reaching oral agreement in principle in the third quarter of 2018 to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture the company began reporting 100 of the flows and aum for invesco great wall also beginning in the third quarter of 2018 the companys nongaap operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying aum and flows adjusted net income is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

 thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap 

management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

  

  

  

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

  

cip revenue 



 management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges see results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016  transaction integration and restructuring for additional details 

5 market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities 

certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically managed by the company invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through a total return swap financial instrument us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation depreciation are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

  

  

  

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

see below for a reconciliation of deferred compensation related items 



  

  

  

6 other reconciling items 

each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 

 



  

  

  

compensation expenses in an effort to isolate and evaluate our level of ongoing compensation expenses and to allow for more appropriate comparisons to internal metrics and with the level of compensation expenses incurred by industry peers

liquidity and capital resources 

our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements material changes in the companys capital structure over the last three years include 

2018 on october 17 2018 the company entered into a definitive agreement whereby invesco will acquire massmutual’s asset management affiliate oppenheimerfunds inc in turn massmutual and the oppenheimerfunds employee shareholders will receive a combination of common and preferred equity consideration and massmutual will become a significant shareholder in invesco with an approximate 17 stake expected at closing  under the terms of the agreement invesco will acquire oppenheimerfunds with consideration to massmutual and oppenheimerfunds employees consisting of 819 million shares of invesco common equity and 4 billion in perpetual noncumulative preferred shares with a 21year noncall period and a fixed rate of 59 the shareholder agreement specifies a lockup period of two years for the common stock and five years for the preferred stock the preferred stock will not be convertible into any other class of capital stock or debt of invesco 

the preferred stock dividend is payable quarterly on a noncumulative basis when if and as declared by the board of directors of invesco however if invesco has not declared and paid or set aside for payment full quarterly dividends on the preferred stock for a particular dividend period it may not declare or pay dividends on or redeem purchase or acquire its common stock or other junior securities in the next succeeding dividend period shares of preferred stock can not be redeemed prior to the 21st anniversary of their original issue date and are redeemable at the option of invesco thereafter the preferred stock has no put feature to accelerate redemption 

on october 18 2018 the company announced a common stock buyback program of 12 billion to be completed within the next two years which will be financed through the strong operating cash flows of the combined invesco and oppenheimerfunds organization for the purpose of repurchasing its shares the company entered into a forward contract during the fourth quarter of 2018 under this contract the counterparty purchased 300 million 144 million shares of the companys shares in the fourth quarter the shares are included as treasury shares in the companys balance sheet and reduced outstanding shares as of december 3 2018 the company intends to repurchase an additional 100300 million prior to the closing of the oppenheimerfunds acquisition depending on market conditions with the remainder to be purchased by the end of 2020 

on april 6 2018 the company completed the acquisition of guggenheim investments etf business for a purchase price of 12 billion  to fund the purchase the company borrowed approximately 835 million on its credit facility in early april 2018 in addition the company also borrowed on the credit facility to fund part of the intelliflo acquisition as of december 31 2018 the remaining balance on the credit facility was 3308 million  

2017 during 2017 the company amended and restated the existing credit facility agreement increasing the borrowing limit to 15 billion  and extending the expiration date to august 11 2022 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was signed into law the 2017 tax act among other items reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 

2016  during 2016 we repurchased 181 million  common shares in open market transactions utilizing 5350 million  in cash under the companys boardapproved open market share repurchase program 

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

 

  

  

  

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating as of the filing of this report invesco held credit ratings of a2stable bbbstable and apositive  from moodys sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences  we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2018  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7202 million   december 31 2017  7614 million  the decrease was primarily driven by the weakening of the pound sterling against the us dollar the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 9967 million  at december 31 2018   december 31 2017  15956 million  in october 2018 upon completion of redomicile of certain funds regulatory credit risk volatility has been reduced which allowed the company to return capital to the parent 

the consolidation of 69820 million  and 52260 million  of total assets and longterm debt of cip as of december 31 2018  respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the majority of cip balances related to consolidated clos the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19  “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

cash flow discussion 

the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and ongoing operating expenses is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions as of december 31 2018  our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is 11477 million  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  no te   20  “r elated parties” for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds 

  

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 24088 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue 

  

  

  

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18  “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2018  



 

 

 

   

in october 2018 the company entered into a forward contract to purchase 300 million  of its common shares and settlement of the purchase will occur by the third quarter of 2019 at december 31 2018  the payable was  2971 million  and is included in other liabilities see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 7  “other liabilities” for additional details 

 

  

  

  

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation 

we operate in several countries states and other localregional taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

the company recognized a provisional income tax benefit of 1307 million  as a component of the provision for income taxes at december 31 2017 related to the 2017 tax act in 2018 the company filed its 2017 tax return and adjusted the provisional estimate for the remeasurement of deferred taxes by 131 million  see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15  taxation for further details and additional discussion on the amounts recorded for the 2017 tax act 

  

  

  

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2018   and   2017   indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 71571 million  and 65907 million  at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

the october 1 2018  annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2017  annual impairment test fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the 2018  annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains or losses and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the discount rate remained fairly consistent for the october 1 2018  analysis compared to the october 1 2017  as there were no significant changes in these assumptions from 2017  

  the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset in addition managements judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 297 million  174 million   and   139 million   for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2018  and 2017  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

  

  

  

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity a vie in the context of the company and its managed funds is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the funds economic performance and the obligation to absorb lossesright to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund then the company is deemed to be the funds primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2018  the company consolidated cip that held investments of 62135 million   december 31 2017  56580 million  

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 



  

  

  

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values or the market inputs contributing to the fair value of these financial instruments 



 

 cash balances invested in money market funds of 3676 million  have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 113848 million  have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the 

  

  

  

investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2018  the interest rates on 863  of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 89  years and the company had a balance of 3308 million  on its floating rate credit facility 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31  was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8  “ longterm debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the companys fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2018  include foreign time deposit investments of 281 million   2017  286 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 046   2017  039  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 02 years  2017  01  years 

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information contains disclosure of revenue from external customers by geography the disclosure of revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling 

given this exposure the company continued to hedge this risk through outofthe money put option contracts to hedge economically the foreign currency risk on the translation of its pound sterlingdenominated earnings into us dollars through the june 29 2019  these programs may serve to reduce but not fully eliminate the impact of pound sterling foreign currency risk and the impact on our consolidated income statements the pound sterlingus dollar contracts have a strike price set at 125 based on the average daily foreign exchange rates for the applicable time period other than the fair value of the put option contracts there is no additional loss exposure to the company only the potential for a gain should the average exchange rates fall below the strike levels during the hedged periods at december 31 2018  a 10 decline in the annual average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would result in a positive cash flow from the pound sterlingus dollar contracts of 155 million 

in january the company entered into additional put option contracts to hedge its poundsterlingbased operating income through the end of 2019 these new put options contracts are set at a strike level of 125  

  

  

  

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation gains  were 42 million  in 2018   2017  157 million  of gains and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation and have put in place net investment hedge structures discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements note 10 other comprehensive incomeloss

strategy 

the company focuses on four key longterm strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 



  

  

 

as an integrated global investment manager we are keenly focused on meeting clients needs and operating effectively and efficiently as an integrated global organization we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” see item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  note 17   geographic information” for a geographic breakdown of our consolidated operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2017    2016   and   2015  

one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm 

2017 developments 

throughout 2017 we continued to execute on our longterm strategic objectives which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and further invested in our products and capabilities our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our longterm success   

invesco achieved solid growth across our global business during 2017 supported by our strong longterm investment performance our comprehensive range of strategies and solutions and our robust client engagement efforts our broadly diversified offering combined with our strong investment performance contributed to longterm aum net inflows of 115 billion  during 2017 also during 2017 we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term we continued to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring worldclass talent upgrading our technology platform launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and we will continue to bring the best of invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients more specifically in 2017 invesco 

 

  

  

  

 

combined these efforts helped us deliver better outcomes for clients while achieving further growth across our global business and further strengthening our competitive position we continue to believe we are in the early stages of achieving the full potential of our global business 

industry trends 

 trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 



  

  

 

as a result of the trends discussed above there are increased signs of a maturing industry in which consolidation is likely to occur we believe invesco is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by these global industry trends our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue meeting client needs and strengthen our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments our multiyear strategic objectives are designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive investment capabilities and our talented people to help us meet client needs we believe firmly that if we help clients achieve their investment objectives and manage our business effectively and efficiently we can further grow our business and deliver strong results to shareholders over the long term 

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors we have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in north america emea and asiapacific serving clients in more than 150  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives 

  

  

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from entities such as individual corporate clients insurance companies endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

the company operates as an integrated global investment manager presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world this is supported with the crossselling of investment capabilities globally and an integrated internal sales force as a result the companys retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types therefore not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are retail products and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are institutional products this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate 

the following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel 



  

  

retail 

invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets including north america emea and asiapacific retail aum was 6370 billion  at december 31 2017  we offer retail products within all of the major asset classes our retail products are primarily distributed through thirdparty financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia 

the uk north american and continental european retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2017  invesco perpetual was the largest retail fund provider in the uk invescos us retail business including our powershares etf franchise was among the 10 largest nonproprietary fund complexes in the us by longterm assets and invesco in continental europe was among the largest nonproprietary investment managers in the retail channel invesco great wall our joint venture in china was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 174 billion  as of december 31 2017  we provide our retail clients with one of the industrys most robust and comprehensive product lines 

institutional 

we provide investment solutions to institutional investors globally with a major presence in north america emea and asiapacific institutional aum was 3006 billion  in aum as of december 31 2017  we offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies including traditional and quantitative equities fixed income including money market funds for institutional clients real estate private equity financial structures and absolute return strategies regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world we have a diversified client base that includes major public entities corporations unions nonprofit organizations endowments foundations pension funds financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds invescos institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions government entities and corporations in the world 

aum diversification 

one of invescos greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class our distribution network has attracted assets of 68  retail and 32  institutional as of december 31 2017  by client domicile 38  of client aum are outside the us and we serve clients in more than 150  countries the following tables present a breakdown of aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class as of december 31 2017  additionally the fourth table below illustrates the split of our aum as passive and active passive aum includes etfs unit investment trusts uits certain nonfee earning leverage and other passive mandates  active aum is total aum less passive aum 

  

  









  

  

employees 

as of december 31 2017  the company had 7030  employees across the globe as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had 6790   and   6490  employees respectively none of our employees is covered under collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach we believe a key factor in invescos ability to manage through all market cycles is our integrated approach to risk management invescos enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management decisionmaking and processes across the organization and provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business and operational risks with coordination between the two 

 

further a network of functional geographic and specific risk management committees under the guidance and standards of the corporate risk management committee maintain ongoing risk assessment management and monitoring processes that provide a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated approximately 46  of our total aum were invested in the equity asset class and approximately 54  were invested in the fixed income asset class and other asset classes at december 31 2017  our aum as of january 31 2018  were 9726 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

  

  

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among client portfolios these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance relative or absolute of the client portfolios managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our client portfolios to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets and frontier markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us registered funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason openend registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 1133 million  or 22  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing our earnings to be more volatile 

  

  

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the client portfolios that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutions many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2017  the company had 8917 million  in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business increase compliance costs andor impose additional capital requirements our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom subsidiaries operating in the european union eu are subject to various eu directives which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise implemented in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on our business while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector some will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies including investment managers while invesco does not believe that the these postcrisis developments have or will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so more broadly we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale or increases the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity 

  

  

in december 2014 then sec chair mary jo white announced a comprehensive agenda for regulatory change governing the us asset management industry and directed sec staff to develop a fivepart series of new regulations addressing the topics of enhanced portfolio reporting liquidity risk management leverage and use of derivatives adviser wind up and stress testing for funds and advisers rules proposed in 2015 for the first two of these initiatives became final in october 2016 the sec has also proposed a rule that would impose restrictions on the use of derivatives by registered funds these new industry rules would or could be expected to add additional reporting and compliance costs and may affect the development of new products and the ability to continue to offer certain strategies through a registered investment company format in late 2017 the sec announced an updated regulatory agenda which deferred deprioritized or removed certain of these items the practical impact of such changes remains uncertain as of the date of this report 

the eu has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and generally have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states ongoing changes in the eu’s regulatory framework applicable to our business including changes related to brexit and any other changes in the composition of the eu’s member states may add further complexity to our global risks and operations 

developments under regulatory changes will or may include without limitation 



  

  

 

we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on our business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products impair the investment performance of our products or impact our product mix our aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’  earnings and business considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash 

  

  

equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences  as of december 31 2017  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7614 million  complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews further as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18   commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility both within the united states and abroad as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets loss of life property damage disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy capital markets or specific international regional or domestic markets may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has become more so in periods of growth of the investment management industry the market for investment professionals and other key personnel is at times characterized by the movement of these professionals among different firms   our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits including equity and other forms of deferred compensation that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

  

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us continuously to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of other clients or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

we have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business however we cannot be assured that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements that we are required to observe in the provision of our services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios such as registered funds a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries or could limit or reduce sales of our products all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products investors remain attracted to lower fee passive products which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on the companys ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements new products often must be in the market place for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows a failure to continue to innovate to introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

  

  

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a2stable anegative and astable  from moodys investor services moodys standard  poors ratings service sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding total debt of 20758 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to invesco ltd of 86961 million  the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations the company expects approximately 80 of the 12 billion purchase price for the upcoming guggenheim investments etf acquisition will be funded through the use of the company’s existing credit facility increasing our outstanding debt in 2018 the company plans to repay the amount borrowed over the course of 2018 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

  

  

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future similarly particularly in the united states certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers if a material portion of our distributors were to cease operations or substantially narrow their product offerings it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs if our third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us it could lead to operational and regulatory problems including with respect to certain of our products which could result in losses enforcement actions or reputational harm and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

  

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade 

  

  

portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions protect the privacy of clients employees and business partners data and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage any inaccuracies delays systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations subject us to client employee or business partner dissatisfaction and losses andor subject us to reputational harm 

our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems and facilities including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control 

in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of confidential data and reputational harm our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats although we take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems which could materially harm our operations and reputation the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions including fines and penalties which could be material and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

  

  

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 65907 million  and 15587 million  respectively at december 31 2017  we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

on october 21 2016 the united states treasury and the irs published final and temporary regulations under section 385 of the internal revenue code 385 regulations that target the inbound financing of a foreignparented multinational groups us subsidiaries there are no immediate impacts to the companys financial position as a result of the application of the 385 regulations in particular as there are broad exceptions for intercompany loans that are shortterm in form and substance cash pooling short term advances shortterm ordinary course of business payables etc on a go forward basis the 385 regulations could limit our ability to efficiently finance or otherwise choose between debt and equity transactions with our us subsidiaries 

the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are involved in much of the coordinated activity as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecds recommendations this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as increase the potential for double taxation 

we continually assess the impact of various us federal state and foreign legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries which could result in a material increase in our us federal state or foreign taxes we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act enacted on december 22 2017 significantly reformed the taxation of business entities the new legislation among other things includes changes to us federal tax rates imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest allows for the expensing of capital expenditures and puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system we continue to examine the impact of this new legislation and the ultimate outcome of the new legislation on our business and financial condition see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15 taxation for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of december 31 2017 for the 2017 tax act 

  

  

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

the european commission ec continues to investigate certain transfer pricing rulings given by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid the investigation was triggered by the oecd  beps action plan as well as the eus own agenda to tackle aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken including retroactive application 10 year period conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties while the company does not believe it has received state aid and is not a party to any investigation due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director’s duties to that company the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our second amended and restated byelaws byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

  

  

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm has advised us that it identified an issue related to an independence requirement contained in the securities exchange act of 1934 regulations regarding auditor independence 

in may 2016 pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc advised the company that it had identified an issue related to its independence under rule 201c1iia of regulation sx loan rule with respect to certain of pwc’s lenders who own certain invesco registered funds managed by certain of our whollyowned investment adviser subsidiaries the company and such funds are required to have their financial statements audited by a public accounting firm that qualifies as independent under various sec rules as discussed below the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec staff has issued a “noaction” letter to another mutual fund complex under substantially similar circumstances and subsequently issued a letter extending the relief provided by the such letter indefinitely 

the loan rule prohibits accounting firms such as pwc from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities specifically the loan rule provides in relevant part that an accounting firm is not independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a “record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client’s equity securities” for purposes of the loan rule audit clients include all of the registered investment companies advised by affiliates of the company as well as the company and its other subsidiaries collectively the invesco funds complex for which pwc also serves as 

  

  

independent auditor pwc informed the company it has relationships with lenders who hold as record owner more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the invesco fund complex these relationships call into question pwc’s independence under the loan rule with respect to those funds as well as all other funds in the invesco fund complex and the company and its subsidiaries 

in june 2016 the sec staff issued a “noaction” letter to another mutual fund complex see fidelity management  research company et al noaction letter  related to the audit independence issue described above in that letter the sec staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an audit client that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the loan rule in certain specified circumstances the circumstances described in the noaction letter are substantially similar to the circumstances that called into question pwc’s independence under the loan rule with respect to the invesco funds complex including the company the company therefore believes that the invesco funds complex can rely on the letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by pwc and we intend to do so in september 2017 the sec staff issued a letter extending the relief in the june 2016 noaction letter referenced above the extension makes no changes to the circumstances in the original noaction letter and does not include a new expiration date providing indefinite relief 

if in the future the independence of pwc is called into question under the loan rule by circumstances that are not addressed in the sec staff’s noaction letter the company will need to take other action and incur additional costs in order for the company’s filings with the sec containing financial statements to be deemed compliant with applicable securities laws such action may include obtaining the review and audit of the financial statements filed by the company by another independent registered public accounting firm in addition under such circumstances the company’s eligibility to issue securities under its existing registration statements on form s3 and forms s8 may be impacted and certain financial reporting covenants with our lenders may be impacted there could be other burdensome requirements or impacts on other entities including registered funds included in the invesco funds complex such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability 

we face the inherent risk of liability related to claims from clients thirdparty vendors or others actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with cyber incidents to help protect against these risks we purchase insurance in amounts and against potential liabilities that we consider appropriate where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable there can be no assurance however that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or if covered will not exceed coverage limits or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured and may increase significantly over relatively short periods in addition certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or coinsurance liability

the us higher interest rates and better jobs data helped the markets early in the year the passing of tax reform including a significant corporate tax rate reduction late in the year led equity markets higher with the sp finishing the year at alltime highs up 194  

european markets similarly benefited from improving confidence and outlook for future growth as the plan for the uk’s exit from the eu continued to take shape the european central bank indicated the potential for a slowing of economic stimulus the bank of england increased interest rates which helped to push the ftse 100 higher finishing the year up 76  

strong corporate results in asia continued optimism for global growth and stability for japan’s government after the results of a snap election late in the year led the nikkei higher finishing the year up 191

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2017  2016  and 2015  



the companys financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the us dollar as discussed in the foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations section and the   results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 section below 

throughout 2017 we continued to execute on our longterm strategic objectives which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and further invested in our products and capabilities our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our longterm success    

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification allows us to recognize growth opportunities in various markets in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles 

as of the filing of this report invesco held credit ratings of a2stable anegative and astable  from moodys investor services moodys sp and fitch respectively 

one of the companys strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform improving effectiveness and efficiency by allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business consistent with this objective business optimization charges of 580 million  were recorded in 2017 including 300 million  of staff severance costs recorded in employee compensation expense associated with a business transformation initiative this is a continuation of efforts to transform several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient by leveraging shared service centers outsourcing automation of key processes and optimization of the companys office footprint given the size of the opportunity on certain initiatives including outsourcing of back office functions the optimization work will continue past the original targeted completion date and spending has increased this optimization work will make invesco a stronger company further increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our global platform and will allow us to fund crucial strategic initiatives as of the end of 2017  this initiative 

  

  

had produced annualized runrate expense savings of 438 million  these savings have helped offset acquisition and regulatoryrelated increases in operating expenses incremental implementation costs in 2018 are estimated to be up to 35 million  and the initiative is expected to generate annualized runrate expense savings of up to 65 million by completion 

the investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the us uk and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries conduct investigations and administer examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

the markets in financial instrument directive mifid ii became effective in europe in january 2018 invesco is committed to ensuring our investment professionals have access to the external research market in order to achieve our longterm investment performance goals therefore the company has announced that beginning in january 2018 external research costs incurred for mifid ii impacting funds and client accounts in europe have been absorbed by the company we do not expect these costs to be material to the companys financial statements 

on august 18 2017 invesco acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of the european etf business our european etf business is a leading independent specialist provider of etfs based in europe which added 260 billion in aum including approximately 7 billion of externally managed aum at acquisition date the combination strengthens invescos existing factorbased capabilities provides additional scale and relevance in the european etf market and enhances the firms ability to meet client needs globally 

as previously announced the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guggenheim investments etf business which includes 76  etfs with 384 billion of assets under management as of december 31 2017  the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an anticipated purchase price of 12 billion to be paid in cash the acquisition will expand the depth breadth and diversity of invescos traditional and smart beta etfs while providing additional scale and relevance in the global growing etf market it will also build on our existing selfindexing capability and bring in highly complementary capabilities that further strengthen our ability to deliver the outcomes clients seek and position us for accelerated growth in the future 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was signed into law the 2017 tax act among other items reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 our intention is to use the additional cash flow generated from the lower tax rate first to reduce the anticipated future outstanding balance on the credit facility resulting from the guggenheim acquisition after the acquisition is complete and the credit facility balance is reduced any residual excess will follow our capital management priorities 

invesco continues to demonstrate its commitment to supporting financial advisors with industry leading tools and resources as we believe these areas are key to delivering superior investment experiences the range of investment capabilities available through jemstep are broad across the firms active alternative and etf offerings additionally jemstep offers open architecture to help advisors provide customized solutions for clients as a marketleading provider of digital solutions jemstep continues to expand its capabilities and market presence and is an integral part of invescos growth strategy 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of consolidated investment products 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various retail mutual funds and similar entities private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10k report as consolidated investments products cip cip includes all variable and voting interest entities as applicable with effect from the adoption of asu 201502 the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1  accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to 

  

  

the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

 

to assess the impact of cip on the companys results of operations and balance sheet discussion refer to part ii item 8 financial statements note 19  consolidated investment products the impact on the companys results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  was a reduction  of 324 million  this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products 

wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and other income and expenses nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented

 assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum includes etfs unit investment trusts uits certain nonfee earning leverage and other passive mandates  active aum is total aum less passive aum 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as longterm as of december 31 2017 the company changed the presentation of longterm inflows outflows and aum to exclude uits and product leverage nonmanagement fee earning aum now includes invesco powershares qqq uits and product leverage in the aum tables below all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation the net flows in nonmanagement fee earning aum can be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 

longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds beginning with the six months ended december 31 2017 reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in longterm inflows to be consistent with general industry practice for previous periods reinvested dividends and capital gains were included in market gains and losses longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

changes in aum were as follows    





  

  

aum are not presented in our operating revenues under us gaap our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income additionally the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from cip however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the companys true effective fee rate from aum 

 

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2017  wer e   9376 billion    december 31 2016  8129 billion  december 31 2015  7756 billion  during the year ended december 31 2017  longterm net inflows  and net inflows  in nonmanagement fee earning aum increased  aum by 115 billion  and 30 billion  respectively offset by net outflows  of institutional money market funds of 32 billion    for the six months ended december 31 2017  longterm net inflows  included an inflow of 70 billion  related to reinvested dividends and capital gains for previous periods reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in market gains and losses during the year ended december 31 2016  longterm net inflows  and net inflows  of institutional money market funds increased  aum by   165 billion   and   128 billion  respectively offset by net   outflows   in nonmanagement fee earning aum of   64 billion  during the year ended   december 31 2015  longterm net   inflows   increased   aum by   166 billion  offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of   119 billion   and net outflows in nonmanagement fee earning aum of   22 billion

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2016  included longterm net active inflows   of   69 billion   and net   inflows   of passive aum of   96 billion  longterm net inflows were split between our institutional distribution channel of   121 billion   and our retail distribution channel of   44 billion  by asset class longterm net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes and were negative for the equity and balanced asset classes longterm net inflows included   155 billion   and   59 billion   from clients domiciled in asia and the us respectively offset by longterm net outflows of   33 billion    11 billion   and   05 billion  from clients domiciled in continental europe canada and the uk respectively

average aum during the year ended december 31 2017  were 8750 billion  compared to 7888 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  a nd   7947 billion   fo r the year ended december 31 2015  

market returns 

market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis during 2017  global markets saw strong returns for the year see below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on aum

revenue yield 

gross revenue yield on aum decreased   11  basis points to 596  basis points in the year ended december 31 2017  from the year ended december 31 2016  level of 607  basis points  december 31 2015  650  basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 3 to the changes in aum table above see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues 

net revenue yield on aum decreased   01  basis point to 429  basis points in the year ended december 31 2017  from the year ended december 31 2016  level of 430  basis points  december 31 2015  458  basis points excluding performance fees the net revenue yield decreased   09  basis points to 415  basis points in the year ended december 31 2017  from the year ended december 31 2016  level of 424  basis points  december 31 2015  446  basis points 

changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2017  passive aum were 1990 billion  representing 212  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2016  passive aum were 1444 billion  representing 178  of our total aum at that date this proportional increase in passive aum correlates with the decline in net revenue yield in 2017  when compared to 2016  the acquisition of the european etf business in the third quarter of 2017 increased the level of passive aum and has a dilutive impact on the companys overall net revenue yield the anticipated acquisition of the guggenheim etf business in the second quarter of 2018 will increase passive balances and will have a further dilutive impact on the companys overall net revenue yield passive aum also increased due to nonmanagement fee earning aum which increased  to 878 billion  at december 31 2017  compared to 713 billion  at december 31 2016   781 billion  at december 31 2015  in the year ended december 31 2017  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 163  basis points compared to 153  basis points in the year ended december 31 2016  an increase  of 10  basis points due to changes in mix of passive aum 

additionally as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the us changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of us dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the “foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations” section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the companys most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49  investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments increased  by 50 million   114  to 487 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  year ended december 31 2016  437 million  primarily due to changes in asset classes which resulted in higher yield our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2017  was 85 billion  compared to 92 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments decreased by 173 million 284 to 437 million for the year ended december 31 2016  year ended december 31 2015  610 million our share 

  

  

of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2016  which was 92 billion  compared to 61 billion  at the year ended december 31 2015  although average aum has increased in the period changes in the mix of these aum from higher feebased equity aum into lower feebased fixed income and other aum have resulted in a decrease in our proportional share of revenues 

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip increased  by 101 million  to 324 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  year ended december 31 2016  223 million  the increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from clos 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased by 169 million  to 223 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  year ended december 31 2015  392 million  the decrease is primarily due to the adoption of asu 201502 which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain vies see note 1 “accounting policies” for the impact upon adoption partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated funds and decreased performance fees earned from cip in the period

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

    the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2017  resulted in an increase  to net income attributable to invesco ltd of 23 million  year ended december 31 2016    30 million   net increase the consolidation of investment products during the year ended   december 31 2015   resulted in a decrease to net income attributable to invesco ltd of   404 million    

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of nonclo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders similarly any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos offsetting in other gainslosses of cip and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate assets under management

schedule of nongaap information 

we utilize the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company’s ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors these measures also assist the company’s management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income operating margin net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to a nongaap basis of net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation adjusted diluted eps these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any us gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates notes to the reconciliations follow the tables

 the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 174 billion  as of december 31 2017  the company has a 49  interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50  joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of these joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys consolidated financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation 

  

  

of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

 thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies  revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum although from timetotime distribution expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launch of closedend funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap 

management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

  

cip revenue 



 business combination related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges the reversal of business combinationrelated deferred tax liabilities recorded under us gaap currency gains recognized on revaluation of foreign currencies held in anticipation of payment for acquisition and other acquisitiondisposition related adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges 

  

  

see table below for a reconciliation of business combination related items 



 



  

  

future and therefore the deferred tax liabilities recognized under us gaap are not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations 

 

 certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically managed by the company invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through a total return swap financial instrument us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation depreciation are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

see below for a reconciliation of deferred compensation related items 



  

  

 each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 



 



  

  

from a nongaap financial measure which is often contemplated by users of the company’s financial information to evaluate the company with industry peers the trueup is not indicative of a trend in future net revenue yield on aum therefore it is not included in management’s evaluation of the results of the business on this basis the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue 

 a separate business optimization location strategy initiative incurred property related charges andor credits of the following 2014  charges of 331 million  associated with vacating leased properties and severance costs of 72 million  related to the initiative 2015 property related charges of 20 million  and lease credit of 64 million  2016 property related charges of 17 million  and lease credit of 32 million  and 2017  property related charges of 27 million  

 operating expenses for 2014  include a charge of 311 million  in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the uk financial conduct authority fca pertaining to the companys compliance with certain fca rules and regulations for the period from may 2008 to november 2012 this charge together with settlementrelated legal costs of 05 million has been recorded in general and administrative expense

included in investments are 2773 million  in equity method investments in our chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company’s private equity partnerships real estate partnerships and other coinvestments  december 31 2016  2790 million  the decrease  of 17 million  in equity method investments was driven by capital returns and the consolidation of certain investments during the current period this decreases were partially offset by current period earnings capital calls into certain partnership investments and increases due to the changes in foreign exchange rates 

assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables 

one of our subsidiaries invesco perpetual life limited is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the uk the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability the increase  in the balance of these accounts from 82242 million  at december 31 2016  to 124445 million  at december 31 2017  was the result of new business net inflows of 32095 million and an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities of 511 million and foreign exchange movements of 9597 million the new business inflows can be primarily attributed to pension and retirement funds investing into multiasset products via this insurance company

liquidity and capital resources 

our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements material changes in the companys capital structure over the last three years include 

2017 during 2017 invesco entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guggenheim investments etf business the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an anticipated purchase price of 12 billion the company expects approximately 80 of the purchase price will be funded through the use of the company’s existing credit facility with the remainder paid in cash the company plans to repay the amount borrowed over the course of 2018 returning leverage ratios to preacquisition levels through the curtailment of open market share repurchases as such the company has not repurchased common shares in the open market during 2017 separately on august 11 2017 the company amended and restated the existing credit facility agreement increasing the borrowing limit to 15 billion  and extending the expiration date to august 11 2022  

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was signed into law the 2017 tax act among other items reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 our intention is to use the additional cash flow generated from the lower tax rate first to reduce the anticipated future outstanding balance on the credit facility resulting from the guggenheim acquisition after the acquisition is complete and the credit facility balance is reduced any residual excess will follow our capital management priorities 

2016  during 2016 we repurchased 181 million  common sh ares in open market transactions utilizing   5350 million   in cash under the companys boardapproved open market share repurchase program

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating as of the filing of this report invesco held credit ratings of a2stable anegative and astable  from moodys sp and fitch ratings fitch respectively our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates 

  

  

credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item   1a  ri sk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive and the uks internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences  we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2017  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 7614 million   december 31 2016  5908 million  the increase was driven primarily by the european etf business acquisition as well the strengthening of the pound sterling against the us dollar the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 15956 million  at december 31 2017   december 31 2016  11684 million 

in addition the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its uit broker dealer entity at december 31 2017  these cash deposits totaled 114 million   december 31 2016  114 million  

the consolidation of 63 billion  and 48 billion  of total assets and longterm debt of cip as of december 31 2017  respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the majority of cip balances related to consolidated closthe collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19  “ consolidated investment products” for additional details

the ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and ongoing operating expenses is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

cash flows of cip discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19  “consolidated investment products” are reflected in invescos cash provided by or used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities cash held by cip is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its cip accordingly the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from cip the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on net cash provided byused in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017  reflects cash used  of 612 million  however this was not used as part of the companys corporate cash activities excluding the impact of cip cash provided by  operations was 14319 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  

 also as illustrated in the table below the sum of the operating investing and financing cash flows of cip offsets to a zero impact to the companys change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted the discussion that follows the table focuses on the company’s cash flows

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions as of december 31 2017  our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is 20064 million  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  no te   20  “r elated parties” for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds 

  

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 20758 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18  “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

  

  

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2017  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation 

we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

the company recognized a provisional income tax benefit of 1307 million  which is included as a component of the provision for income taxes related to the 2017 tax act see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15  taxation for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of december 31 2017 for the 2017 tax act 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2017   and   2016   indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 65907 million  and 61292 million  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

the october 1 2017  annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2016  annual impairment test fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the 2017  annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant 

  

  

change in assumptions from 2016  related to a change in cost of equity which resulted in a discount rate of 1168 for the october 1 2017  analysis  2016  130 

  the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset in addition managements judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 174 million  139 million   and   106 million   for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2017  and 2016  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

investments 

a significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 



  

  

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

we also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above 

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity a vie in the context of the company and its managed funds is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the funds economic performance and the obligation to absorb lossesright to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund then the company is deemed to be the funds primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2017  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 56580 million   december 31 2016  50663 million  as of december 31 2016   the company consolidated voes that held fund investments of 498 million  as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip however changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests 

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values or the market inputs contributing to the fair value of these financial instruments 



 

 any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of availableforsale debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax until the debt security is sold or otherwise disposed of or if the debt security is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in income the company evaluates the carrying value of debt securities for impairment on a quarterly basis in its impairment analysis the company takes into consideration numerous criteria including the duration and extent of any decline 

  

  

in fair value and the intent and ability of the company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value if the decline in value is determined to be otherthantemporary the carrying value of the security is generally written down to fair value through the consolidated statement of income if such a 10 decrease in fair values were to occur it would not result in an otherthantemporary impairment charge that would be material to our pretax earnings 

 cash balances invested in money market funds of 8755 million  have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 124445 million  have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2017  the interest rates on 1000  of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 99  years and the company had a zero balance on its floating rate credit facility 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31  was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8  “ longterm debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

  

  

the companys fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2017  include foreign time deposit investments of 286 million   2016  269 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 039   2016  030  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 01 years  2016  02  years 

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information contains disclosure of revenue from external customers by geography the disclosure of revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling 

given this exposure in 2017 the company continued to hedge this risk through outofthe money put option contracts to hedge economically the foreign currency risk on the translation of its eurodenominated earnings into us dollars though the end of 2017 and during the second quarter extended its hedge of the pound sterlingdenominated earnings into us dollars through december 31 2018 these programs may serve to reduce but not fully eliminate the impact of pound sterling and euro foreign currency risk and the impact on our consolidated income statements the pound sterlingus dollar contracts have a strike price set at 12500 based on the average daily foreign exchange rates for the applicable time period at december 31 2017 the fair value of the companys open put option contracts was 08 million  other than the fair value of the put option contracts there is no additional loss exposure to the company only the potential for a gain should the average exchange rates fall below the strike levels during the hedged periods at december 31 2017 a 10 decline in the annual average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would result in a positive cash flow from the pound sterlingus dollar contracts of 61 million 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation gains  were 157 million  in 2017   2016  53 million  of losses and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation and have put in place net investment hedge structures discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements note 10 other comprehensive incomeloss

strategy 

the company focuses on four key longterm strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

 

  

  

as an integrated global investment manager we are keenly focused on meeting clients needs and operating effectively and efficiently as an integrated global organization we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 17  geographic information” for a geographic breakdown of our consolidated operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm 

2016 developments 

throughout 2016 we continued to execute on our longterm strategic objectives which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins despite volatile financial markets we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our longterm success   

invesco achieved solid growth across our global business during 2016 supported by our strong longterm investment performance our comprehensive range of strategies and solutions and our robust client engagement efforts our broadly diversified offering combined with our strong investment performance contributed to longterm aum net inflows of 127 billion during 2016 also during 2016 we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term we continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring worldclass talent upgrading our technology platforms launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and we will continue to bring the best of invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients more specifically in 2016 invesco 

  

  

  

 

combined these efforts helped us deliver better outcomes for clients while achieving further growth across our global business and further enhanced our competitive position we continue to believe we are in the early stages of achieving the full potential of our global business 

industry trends 

 trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

 

as a result of the trends discussed above there are increased signs of a maturing industry in which consolidation is likely to occur we believe invesco is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by these global industry trends our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue meeting client needs and strengthening our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments our multiyear strategic objectives are designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive investment capabilities and our talented people to help us meet client needs we believe firmly that if we help clients achieve their investment objectives and manage our business effectively and efficiently we can further grow our business and deliver strong results to shareholders over the long term 

  

  

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors we have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in north america emea and asiapacific serving clients in more than 100  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives 

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from entities such as individual corporate clients insurance companies endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

the company operates as an integrated global investment manager presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world this is supported with the crossselling of investment capabilities globally and an integrated internal sales force as a result the companys retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types therefore not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are retail products and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are institutional products this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate 

  

  

the following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel 



retail 

invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets including north america emea and asiapacific retail aum was 5265 billion  at december 31 2016  we offer retail products within all of the major asset classes our retail products are primarily distributed through thirdparty financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia 

the uk us canadian and continental european retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2016  invesco perpetual was the largest retail fund provider in the uk invescos us retail business including our powershares etf franchise was among the 10 largest nonproprietary fund complexes in the us by longterm assets and invesco in continental europe was among the largest nonproprietary investment managers in the retail channel invesco great wall our joint venture in china was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 184 billion  as of december 31 2016  we provide our retail clients with one of the industrys most robust and comprehensive product lines 

institutional 

we provide investment solutions to institutional investors globally with a major presence in north america emea and asiapacific institutional aum was 2864 billion  in aum as of december 31 2016  we offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies including traditional and quantitative equities fixed income including money market funds for institutional clients real estate private equity financial structures and absolute return strategies regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world we have a diversified client base that includes major public entities corporations unions nonprofit organizations endowments foundations pension funds financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds invescos institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions government entities and corporations in the world 

aum diversification 

one of invescos greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class our distribution network has attracted assets of 65  retail and 35  institutional as of december 31 2016  by client domicile 34  of client aum are outside the us and we serve clients in more than 100  countries the following tables present a breakdown of aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class as of december 31 2016  additionally the fourth table below illustrates the split of our aum as passive and active passive aum includes etfs unit investment trusts uits leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

  

  









  

  

employees 

as of december 31 2016  the company had 6790  employees across the globe as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 6490  and 6264  employees respectively the majority of the headcount increase is attributable to growth in our global shared service centers none of our employees is covered under collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach we believe a key factor in invescos ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of recent years was our integrated approach to risk management invescos enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization and provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business and operational risks 

 

further a network of functional geographic and specific risk management committees under the guidance and standards of the corporate risk management committee maintain ongoing risk assessment management and monitoring processes that provide a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

  

  

declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated approximately 45  of our total aum were invested in the equity asset class and approximately 55  were invested in the fixed income asset class and other asset classes at december 31 2016  our aum as of january 31 2017  were 8253 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among client portfolios these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the client portfolios managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our client portfolios to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic and diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets and frontier markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us registered funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason openend registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

  

  

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 443 million  or 09  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the client portfolios that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutions many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2016  the company had 9568 million  in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business increase compliance costs andor impose additional capital requirements our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom subsidiaries operating in the european union eu are subject to various eu directives which generally are implemented by member state national legislation our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise implemented in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on invescos business while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector some will or may be applied more broadly 

  

  

and affect other financial services companies including investment managers we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale or increases the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 while invesco does not believe that the doddfrank act has or will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so moreover the doddfrank act mandated many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation 

in december 2014 then sec chair mary jo white announced a comprehensive agenda for regulatory change governing the us asset management industry and directed sec staff to develop a fivepart series of new regulations addressing the topics of enhanced portfolio reporting liquidity risk management leverage and use of derivatives adviser wind up and stress testing for funds and advisers rules proposed in 2015 for the first two of these initiatives became final in october 2016 these new industry rules can be expected to add additional reporting and compliance costs and may affect the development of new products and the ability to continue to offer certain strategies through a registered investment company format 

the eu has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and generally have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and compliance costs and will or may continue to do so similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business which could have similar effects 

developments under regulatory changes will or may include without limitation 



  

  

pension pooling and investment consultant regulations in the institutional segment conclusions are not expected until midtolate 2017 

 

invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on its business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invescos results of operations financial condition or liquidity similarly regulatory enforcement actions which impose significant penalties or compliance obligations or which result in significant reputational harm could have similar material adverse effects on invesco moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products impair the investment performance of our products or impact our product mix our aggregate aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’  earnings and business considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising 

  

  

from the eus capital requirements directive iv crd iv and the uk fcas internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences   as of december 31 2016 the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 5908 million december 31 2015 5347 million  complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews further as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18   commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility both within the united states and abroad as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets loss of life property damage disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity acts of terror may also result in increased border security between countries which could adversely affect trade impede growth and exacerbate refugee crises arising out of civil or international conflicts continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy capital markets or specific international regional or domestic markets may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

  

  

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has become more so in periods of growth of the investment management industry the market for investment professionals and other key personnel is at times characterized by the movement of these professionals among different firms   our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits including equity and other forms of deferred compensation that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us continuously to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of other clients or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by invesco and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

we have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business however we cannot be assured that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries 

  

  

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios such as registered funds a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries or could limit or reduce sales of our products all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products investors are increasingly attracted to lower fee passive products which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on the companys ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements new products often must be in the market place for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows a failure to continue to innovate to introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

  

  

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of astable from standard  poors ratings services a2stable from moodys and apositive from fitch ratings as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding total debt of 21024 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to invesco ltd of 75038 million  the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

  

  

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if a material portion of our distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs if our third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us it could lead to operational and regulatory problems including with respect to certain of our products which could result in losses enforcement actions or reputational harm and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

  

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions protect the 

  

  

privacy of clients employees and business partners data and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage any inaccuracies delays systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations subject us to client employee or business partner dissatisfaction and losses andor subject us to reputational harm 

our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems and facilities including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control although we take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems which could materially harm our operations and reputation the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions including fines and penalties which could be material and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

  

  

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 61292 million  and 13994 million  respectively at december 31 2016   december 31 2015  61757 million  and 13540 million  respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

on october 21 2016 the united states treasury and the irs published final and temporary regulations under section 385 of the internal revenue code the 385 regulations that i establish threshold documentation requirements that ordinarily must be satisfied in order for certain relatedparty interests in a corporation to be treated as indebtedness for us federal income tax purposes and ii treat as stock certain relatedparty interests that otherwise would be treated as indebtedness for us federal income purposes the 385 regulations target the inbound financing of a foreignparented multinational groups us subsidiaries while limiting their applicability to us based multinational organizations the documentation rules apply to debt issued on or after january 1 2018 and to debt issued after that date pursuant to an overall arrangement in effect prior to that date however the 385 regulations apply retroactively to debt transacted or issued on or after april 4 2016 

there are no immediate impacts to the companys financial position as a result of the application of the 385 regulations in particular as there are broad exceptions for intercompany loans that are shortterm in form and substance cash pooling short term advances shortterm ordinary course of business payables etc on a go forward basis the 385 regulations could limit our ability to efficiently finance or otherwise choose between debt and equity transactions with our us subsidiaries both the extensive documentation rules and lengthy testing period of the 385 regulations will lead to increased complexity and compliance costs it is unclear at this time how the 385 regulations will be interpreted or adopted for state income tax purposes and therefore our assessment cannot be completed until further guidance is issued 

on october 5 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its final reports related to its action plan for multilateral cooperation to address tax base erosion and profit shifting beps concerns the second phase of the beps project covers clarifications implementation and monitoring countries have implemented some of the action items and will continue to adopt more of them over the next several years as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation countries may also decide to implement their own approaches unilaterally independent of the beps recommendations this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as increase the potential for double taxation 

we continually assess the impact of various us federal state and foreign legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries which could result in a material increase in our us federal state or foreign taxes from timetotime proposals are introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both there is a likelihood that some form of fundamental us corporate tax reform is enacted in 2017 and 2018 at this point in time no specific proposals have been submitted to congress so the nature of any reform has not yet been determined 

we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

the european commission ec continues to investigate certain transfer pricing rulings given by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid the investigation was triggered by the oecd  beps action plan as well as the eus own agenda to tackle aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken including retroactive application 10 year period conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties while the company does not believe it has received state aid and is not a party to any investigation due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director’s duties to that company the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our second amended and restated byelaws byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

  

  

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm has advised us that it identified an issue related to an independence requirement contained in the securities exchange act of 1934 regulations regarding auditor independence 

in may 2016 pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc advised the company that it had identified an issue related to its independence under rule 201c1iia of regulation sx loan rule with respect to certain of pwc’s lenders who own certain invesco registered funds managed by certain of our whollyowned investment adviser subsidiaries the company and such funds are required to have their financial statements audited by a public accounting firm that qualifies as independent under various sec rules as discussed below the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec staff has issued a “noaction” letter to another mutual fund complex under substantially similar circumstances that provides temporary relief for eighteen months from the date of the noaction letter issuance 

the loan rule prohibits accounting firms such as pwc from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities specifically the loan rule provides in relevant part that an accounting firm is not independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a “record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client’s equity securities” for purposes of the loan rule audit clients include all of the registered investment companies advised by affiliates of the company 

  

  

as well as the company and its other subsidiaries collectively the invesco funds complex for which pwc also serves as independent auditor pwc informed the company it has relationships with lenders who hold as record owner more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the invesco fund complex these relationships call into question pwc’s independence under the loan rule with respect to those funds as well as all other funds in the invesco fund complex and the company and its subsidiaries 

on june 20 2016 the sec staff issued a “noaction” letter to another mutual fund complex see fidelity management  research company et al noaction letter  related to the audit independence issue described above in that letter the sec staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an audit client that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the loan rule in certain specified circumstances the circumstances described in the noaction letter appear to be substantially similar to the circumstances that called into question pwc’s independence under the loan rule with respect to the invesco funds complex including the company the company therefore believes that the invesco funds complex can rely on the letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by pwc and we intend to do so the sec staff has indicated that the noaction relief will expire eighteen months from its issuance ie on december 20 2017 pwc has advised us that it is continuing to have discussions with the sec staff regarding permanent relief 

if in the future the independence of pwc is called into question under the loan rule by circumstances that are not addressed in the sec staff’s noaction letter or permanent relief regarding this matter is not granted by the sec the company will need to take other action and incur additional costs in order for the company’s filings with the sec containing financial statements to be deemed compliant with applicable securities laws such action may include obtaining the review and audit of the financial statements filed by the company by another independent registered public accounting firm in addition under such circumstances the company’s eligibility to issue securities under its existing registration statements on form s3 and forms s8 may be impacted and certain financial reporting covenants with our lenders may be impacted there could be other burdensome requirements or impacts on other entities including registered funds included in the invesco funds complex such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability 

we face the inherent risk of liability related to claims from clients thirdparty vendors or others actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with cyber incidents to help protect against these risks we purchase insurance in amounts and against potential liabilities that we consider appropriate where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable there can be no assurance however that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or if covered will not exceed coverage limits or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured and may increase significantly over relatively short periods in addition certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or coinsurance liability

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

global financial markets in 2016 were characterized by high levels of volatility and impacted by a number of geopolitical events that drove investor sentiment and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equity markets began 2016 in sharp decline amidst 

  

  

renewed concerns about the prospects for future global growth and declining commodity prices after a rebound in the second quarter the surprise result of the latejune uk referendum to leave the european union increased uncertainty and volatility in the markets and resulted in significant shortterm declines in global indices and a steep decline in the pound sterling exchange rate relative to the us dollar a subsequent secondhalf rally drove indices to record levels late in the year as the results of the us presidential election and outlook on federal reserve monetary policy positively impacted market sentiment and investor’s outlook for earnings growth the divergent global central bank policies saw the us federal reserve increasing rates in contrast to accommodative monetary policy outside the us these actions in conjunction with investor’s views of the us dollar as a safe haven in volatile markets drove us dollar gains against all major currencies during 2016 

speculation of the potential for reduced regulation and corporate tax rates following the us election along with signs from the federal reserve of a strengthening us economy drove us indices to alltime highs with the sp 500 index finishing up 95  for 2016 despite the sharp midyear decline following the results of the uk referendum positive economic indicators drove european markets higher with the ftse 100 finishing the year up 144  in local currency a decline in the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate offset the ftse 100 gains causing the return to be down 41  for the year on an asconverted to us dollars basis ongoing favorable monetary policy by the japanese government and central bank and adoption of a negative interest rate policy weighed on markets early in the year but saw markets rebound in the second half on a more positive growth outlook for domestic exporters on the strength of the us currency driving the nikkei higher to finish the year up 04  in local currency terms 

bond markets were likewise volatile during 2016 with the barclay’s us aggregate bond index finishing up 27  gains early in the year from investors moving to the relative safety of bonds were reversed as the results from the us presidential election drove expectations for future inflation growth and increased interest rates 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2016  2015  and 2014  



the companys 2016 financial results were significantly negatively impacted by the appreciation of the us dollar as discussed in the foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations section and the   results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 section below 

throughout 2016 we continued to execute on our longterm strategic objectives which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins despite volatile financial markets we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our longterm success    

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification allows us to recognize growth opportunities in various markets in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles 

as of the filing of this report invesco held credit ratings of astable a2stable and apositive from standard  poors ratings service sp moodys investor services moodys and fitch ratings fitch respectively 

  

  

one of the companys strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform by improving effectiveness and efficiency by allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business consistent with this objective business optimization charges of 499 million  were recorded in 2016 including 264 million  of staff severance costs recorded in employee compensation associated with a business transformation initiative this is a continuation of efforts to transform several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient by leveraging shared service centers outsourcing automation of key processes and optimization of the companys office footprint incremental implementation costs in 2017 are estimated to be up to 30 million and the initiative is expected to generate ongoing cost savings that will more than fully offset the implementation expense within a three year time frame after completion during 2016 the company purchased the remaining 51 of invesco asset management india private limited formerly our joint venture religare invesco asset management company increasing our interest to 100 replacing the equity method investment with a fully consolidated subsidiary and also purchased jemstep the business optimization savings have helped offset acquisitionrelated increases in operating expenses 

during 2015 the company acquired deutsche banks us commodity us etf business for a purchase price composed of contingent consideration payable in future periods during 2016 changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability generated a loss of 74 million  which was recorded in other gains and losses net 

the investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the us uk and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries conduct investigations and administer examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of consolidated investment products 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1  accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation 

investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this report as either consolidated sponsored investment products csip or consolidated investment products cip the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

 

to assess the impact of cip on the companys results of operations and balance sheet discussion refer to part ii item 8 financial statements note 20  consolidated investment products the impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  was a reduction  of 223 million  this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products

foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations 

a significant portion of our business is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen will impact our assets liabilities aum and reported revenues and expenses from period to period the assets liabilities and aum of foreign subsidiaries are translated at period end spot foreign currency exchange rates the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates

a comparison of period end spot rates between december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  shows a weakening of the pound sterling and the euro relative to the us dollar which is reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased and euro assets liabilities and aum into us dollars over the same period the canadian dollar and japanese yen have strengthened relative to the us dollar which is reflected in the translation of our canadian dollarbased and japanese yenbased assets liabilities and aum into us dollars respectively 

a comparison of period end spot rates between december 31 2015  and december 31 2014 shows a weakening of the pound sterling the euro the canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which is reflected in the translation of the respective currencybased assets liabilities and aum into us dollars 

 a comparison of the average foreign exchange rates used for the year ended december 31 2016  when compared to the year ended december 31 2015  shows a significant weakening of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar together with a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar which is reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased and canadian dollarbased revenue and expenses into us dollars over the same period the japanese yen strengthened significantly relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our japanese yenbased revenue and expenses into us dollars respectively the euro exchange rate was very similar across the two periods 

a comparison of the average foreign exchange rates used for the year ended december 31 2015  when compared to the year ended december 31 2014 shows a significant weakening of the pound sterling the euro the canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which is reflected in the translation of of the respective currencybased revenue and expenses into us dollars 

  

  

 assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum includes etfs uits leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee and other passive mandates active aum are total aum less passive aum 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as longterm longterm aum excludes institutional money market and invesco powershares qqq aum longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements the net flows in invesco powershares qqq aum can also be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

changes in aum were as follows    





  

  

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2016  were 8129 billion   december 31 2015  7756 billion  december 31 2014  7924 billion  during the year ended december 31 2016  longterm net inflows  and net inflows  of institutional money market funds increased  aum by 127 billion  and 128 billion  respectively offset by net outflows  of the invesco powershares qqq fund of 26 billion  during the year ended december 31 2015  longterm net inflows   increased  aum by 162 billion  offset by net outflows  in institutional money market funds of 119 billion  and the invesco powershares qqq fund of 18 billion  during the year ended december 31 2014  longterm net inflows   increased  aum by 81 billion  offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of 58 billion  and the invesco powershares qqq fund of 107 billion  

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2016  include longterm net active inflows  of 69 billion  and inflows  of passive aum of 58 billion  longterm net inflows were split between our institutional distribution channel of 110 billion  and our retail distribution channel of 17 billion  by asset class longterm net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes and were negative for the equity and balanced asset classes longterm net inflows included 155 billion  and 21 billion  from clients domiciled in asia and the us respectively offset by longterm net outflows of 33 billion  11 billion  and 05 billion  from clients domiciled in continental europe canada and the uk respectively 

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2015  included longterm net inflows  of active aum of 141 billion  and passive aum of 21 billion  net flows in 2015  were split between net inflows of 134 billion into our institutional distribution channel and 28 billion  into our retail distribution channel 2015 longterm net flows were positive for the fixed income alternatives and balanced classes and were negative for the equity asset classes longterm net inflows included 83 billion 57 billion 18 billion and 09 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe asia the us and the uk respectively these inflows were offset by longterm outflows of 05 billion from clients domiciled in canada 

net inflows during the year ended december 31 2014  included longterm net inflows of passive aum inflows of 60 billion and active aum of 21 billion net flows in 2014 were split between net inflows of 50 billion into our retail distribution channel and 31 billion into our institutional distribution channel 

average aum during the year ended december 31 2016  were 7888 billion  compared to 7947 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  and 7903 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  

market returns 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis 2016  markets were characterized by high levels of volatility throughout the year on a yeartodate basis the us market finished strong as did the uk market and the emerging markets in their local currencies see below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on aum 

during the year ended december 31 2016  positive  market movement increased  aum by 377 billion  with gains in each asset asset class during the year ended december 31 2015  negative market movement decreased aum by 26 billion  with declines in the alternatives fixed income and balanced asset classes partially offset by gains in the equity asset class during the year ended december 31 2014  market gains increased aum by 347 billion  and included gains in our equity asset class of 260 billion  

foreign exchange rates 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we experienced decreases  in aum of  221 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2015  aum decreased  by 160 billion  due to foreign exchange rate changes during the year ended december 31 2014  we experienced decreases in aum of 126 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the “foreign exchange impact on balance sheet assets under management and results of operations” section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates 

  

  

acquisitions and dispositions 

during the year ended december 31 2016  dispositions of 27 billion related to the deconsolidation of certain securitization trusts by invesco mortgage capital inc ivr and other aum dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of the controlling interest of invesco asset management india private limited which added 24 billion to aum for the year ended december 31 2015  dispositions resulted in a 07 billion decrease in aum representing exchange traded notes that did not transfer over as part of the agreement with deutsche bank to transition the investment management of the powershares db suite of commodity exchange traded funds to invesco for the year ended december 31 2014  there were no acquisitions or dispositions 

revenue yield 

gross revenue yield on aum decreased   43  basis points to 607  basis points in the year ended december 31 2016  from the year ended december 31 2015  level of 650  basis points  december 31 2014  655 basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the changes in aum table above see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues 

net revenue yield on aum decreased   28  basis points to 430  basis points in the year ended december 31 2016  from the year ended december 31 2015  level of 458  basis points  december 31 2014  457 basis points excluding performance fees the net revenue yield decreased   22  basis points to 424  basis points in the year ended december 31 2016  from the year ended december 31 2015  level of 446  basis points  december 31 2014  448 basis points 

changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield for example on an asset class basis our equity alternative and balanced aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income aum the combination of average equity average alternative and average balanced aum decreased to 657  of total average aum in 2016 from 677  in 2015  this asset class mix correlates with the decline in net revenue yield in 2016  when compared to 2015  

additionally as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the us changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of us dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies as fee rates differ across geographic locations changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields the strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling during the year ended december 31 2016  when compared to the prior year resulted in a reduction in the net revenue yield as it reduced the weighting of higher fee earning aum attributable to the uk products 

the tables that follow present aum by total aum and passive aum passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2016  passive aum were 1444 billion  representing 178  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2015  passive aum were 1391 billion  representing 179  of our total aum at that date the increase in passive aum during 2016  is driven by longterm net inflows and market gains and is partially offset by outflows from the invesco powershares qqq fund and dispositions the invesco powershares qqq fund aum decreased  to 420 billion  at december 31 2016  compared to 429 billion  at december 31 2015   407 billion  at december 31 2014  the revenue yield for invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point reimbursing invesco for the portfolio trading and marketing services provided to the fund in the year ended december 31 2016  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 153  basis points compared to 145  basis points in the year ended december 31 2015  an increase  of 08  basis points due to changes in mix of passive aum

the discussion below includes the use of nongaap financial measures see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures 

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



 

 

operating revenues decreased  by 76  in the year ended december 31 2016  to 47344 million  year ended december 31 2015  51229 million  net revenues decreased  by 69  in the year ended december 31 2016  to 33932 million  year ended december 31 2015  36432 million  operating revenues decreased  by 05  in the year ended december 31 2015  to  51229 million  year ended december 31 2014   51471 million  net revenues increased  by 10  in the year ended december 31 2015  to 36432 million  year ended december 31 2014  36083 million  

the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  operating revenues by 1368 million  equivalent to 29  of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2016  when compared to the year ended december 31 2015  2191 million decrease in 2015  as compared to 2014  or 43 of 2015  total operating revenues 

additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period market movements are discussed in the executive overview section of this managements discussion and analysis during 2016  foreign exchange rate changes and volatile markets throughout the year combined for a 07   decrease  in average aum when compared to 2015  while ending aum is higher by 48 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1 accounting policies  revenue recognition for more information regarding the components of each operating revenue category as well as third party distribution service and advisory expenses 

investment management fees 

investment management fees decreased  by 2880 million   71  in the year ended december 31 2016  to 37731 million  year ended december 31 2015  40611 million  this compares to a 07   decrease  in average aum the impact of foreign

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments

    cip are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level therefore there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of cip the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2016  resulted in an increase  to net income attributable to invesco ltd of 30 million  year ended december 31 2015  404 million  net decrease the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2014  resulted in an increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd of 78 million  

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of nonclo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders similarly any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos offsetting in other gainslosses of cip and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources of the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate assets under management 

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes incomelosses of cip however the companys operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under us gaap as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation therefore total us and foreign income before taxes in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 15  taxation which includes incomelosses from cip and us and foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information in which cip has been eliminated may not correlate the table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of cip is separately stated so that the impact of cip is evident 

total us income before taxes decreased   1480 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  to 5399 million  from 6879 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  and includes us income of cip of 24 million   december 31 2015  260 million  us income from cip decreased   236 million   908  from 2015  due primarily to the impact of private equity partnerships that were deconsolidated upon the adoption of asu 201502 excluding cip us income before taxes in 2016   decreased   1244 million   188  from december 31 2015  due to a larger decrease in us operating revenues than operating expenses 

total foreign income before taxes decreased   75 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  to 6667 million  from 6742 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  and includes foreign income of cip of 147 million   december 31

schedule of nongaap information 

we are presenting the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps we believe these nongaap measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income  operating margin net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd and by calculation adjusted diluted eps notes to the reconciliations follow the tables 

  

  

reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues 



reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income 



reconciliation of net income attributable to invesco ltd to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd 



 

  the effective tax rate on adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd is 268 2015 271 2014 266 2013 263 2012 251 

adjusted diluted eps is equal to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted shares outstanding there is no difference between the calculated earnings per share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per share amounts under the two class method 

  

  

 the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 184 billion  as of december 31 2016  the company has a 49  interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50  joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of these joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys consolidated financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

 thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies  revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum although from timetotime distribution expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launch of closedend funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap 

management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum and the related computation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

  

  

  

cip revenue 



 business combination related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges tax cash flow benefits and other acquisitiondisposition related adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges 

see table below for a reconciliation of business combination related items 



 



  

  

with achieving synergy savings additionally transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closedend funds included in a prior acquisition 

 

  

  

 certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically the funds managed by the employee invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment appreciation depreciation is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

see below for a reconciliation of deferred compensation related items 



  

  

 each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 



 



  

  

therefore it is not included in management’s evaluation of the results of the business on this basis the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue 

 operating expenses in 2014  include expenses related to a separate business optimization location strategy initiative the company incurred property related charges of 331 million   2016  17 million  2015 20 million  associated with vacating leased properties and severance costs of 72 million  related to the initiative lease credits of 64 million  and 32 million  were recorded in 2015 and 2016 respectively 

 operating expenses for 2014  include a charge of 311 million  in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the uk financial conduct authority fca pertaining to the companys compliance with certain fca rules and regulations for the period from may 2008 to november 2012 this charge together with settlementrelated legal costs of 05 million has been recorded in general and administrative expense

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating as of the date of this report invesco held credit ratings of astable a2stable and apositive from sp moodys and fitch respectively our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk 

  

  

exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the eus capital requirements directive iv crd iv and the uk fcas internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences  we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2016 the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 5908 million december 31 2015 5347 million  the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 11684 million  at december 31 2016   december 31 2015  16127 million

the consolidation of 60 billion  and 44 billion  of total assets and longterm debt of cip as of december 31 2016  respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the majority of cip balances related to consolidated closthe collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

cash flows discussion 

the ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and ongoing operating expenses is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

cash flows of cip discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” are reflected in invescos cash provided by or used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities cash held by cip is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its cip accordingly the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from cip the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on net cash provided byused in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016  reflects cash used  of 7142 million  however this was not used as part of the companys corporate cash balances excluding the impact of cip cash provided by  operations was 8435 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the cip cash flow variances from 2015 to 2016 on operating investing and financing activities primarily result from the impact of the adoption of asu 201602 which is discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1 accounting policies  accounting pronouncements recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements in addition to the impact of new funds consolidated in 2016 following the adoption the adoption resulted in the consolidation of certain investment products in 2016 which were not previously consolidated additionally the funds consolidated in prior periods as csip became vies and are now consolidated as cip 

 also as illustrated in the table below the sum of the operating investing and financing cash flows of cip offsets to a zero impact to the companys change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted the discussion that follows the table focuses on the company’s cash flows

the december 31 2016  and 2015  coverage ratio calculations are as follows 



 

 

 

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

  

  

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

   

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 21024 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18  “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2016  



 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation 

we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

  

  

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15  taxation for additional discussion of these items 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2016  and 2015  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 61292 million  and 61757 million  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

the october 1 2016  annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2015  annual impairment test fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the 2016  annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant change in assumptions from 2015  related to an increase in the equity risk premium which resulted in a discount rate of 130 for the october 1 2016  analysis  2015  116 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 139 million  106 million  and 126 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated 

  

  

future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2016  and 2015  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

investments 

a significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

we also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above 

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity a vie in the context of the company and its managed funds is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the funds economic performance and the obligation to absorb lossesright to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund then the company is deemed to be the funds primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund 

  

  

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2016  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 50663 million   december 31 2015  53732 million  and voe fund investments of 498 million   december 31 2015  7191 million as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip however changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests 

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values or the market inputs contributing to the fair value of these financial instruments 



 



  

  

 cash balances invested in money market funds of 4762 million  have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 82242 million  have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2016  the interest rates on 1000  of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 110  years borrowings under the credit facility will have floating interest rates 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31  was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8  “debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the companys fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2016  include foreign time deposit investments of 269 million   2015  247 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 030   2015  039  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 02 years  2015  02  years 

  

  

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information contains disclosure of revenue from external customers by geography the disclosure of revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling a 10 decline in the annual average pound sterling exchange rate from the current rate will result in an approximate 7 cent decline unhedged in annual earnings per share and an erosion of 30 basis points of operating margin a 10 decline in the annual average euro exchange rate from the current rate will result in an approximate 3 cent decline unhedged in annual earnings per share and an erosion of 10 basis points of operating margin 

given this exposure in 2016 the company continued to hedge this risk through outofthe money put option contracts to hedge economically the foreign currency risk on the translation of its pound sterlingdenominated earnings into us dollars and starting in the third quarter the eurodenominated earnings into us dollars though the end of 2017 these programs may serve to reduce but not fully eliminate the impact of pound sterling and euro foreign currency risk and the impact on our consolidated income statements a strike level is set at 14355 for the pound sterlingus dollar contracts covering january 2017 through march 2017 and 12496 for the period april 2017 through december 2017 the eurous dollar contracts have a strike price set at 10719 at december 31 2016 the fair value of the companys open put option contracts was 218 million  other than the fair value of the put option contracts there is no additional loss exposure to the company only the potential for a gain should the average exchange rates fall below the strike levels during the hedged periods at december 31 2016 a 10 decline in the annual average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would result in a positive cash flow from the pound sterlingus dollar contracts of 323 million a 10 decline in the annual average euro to us dollar exchange rate would result in a positive cash flow from the eurous dollar contracts of 266 million 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation losses  were 53 million  in 2016   2015  17 million  of losses and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation and have put in place net investment hedge structures discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements note 10other comprehensive incomeloss

supported by a global platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors we have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in north america uk europe middle east and asiapacific serving clients in more than 100  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management provide us with a robust competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives as of december 31 2015  478  of our aum were invested in equity securities and 522  in fixed income and other investments  december 31 2014  485  in equity and 515  in fixed income and other investments 

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from individual corporate clients endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

the company operates as an integrated global investment manager presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world this is supported with the crossselling of investment capabilities globally and an integrated internal sales force as a result the companys retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types therefore not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are retail products and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are institutional products this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate 

  

  

the following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel 



retail 

invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets including the us uk canada continental europe and asia retail aum was 5148 billion  at december 31 2015  we offer retail products within all of the major asset classes our retail products are primarily distributed through thirdparty financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia 

the uk us canadian and continental european retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2015  invesco perpetual was the largest retail fund provider in the uk invescos us retail business was among the 10 largest nonproprietary fund complexes in the us by longterm assets including the invesco powershares franchise and invesco in continental europe was among the largest nonproprietary investment managers in the retail channel invesco great wall our joint venture in china was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 147 billion  as of december 31 2015  we provide our retail clients with one of the industrys most robust and comprehensive product lines

aum diversification

employees 

as of december 31 2015  the company had 6490  employees across the globe as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 6264  and 5932  employees respectively the majority of the headcount increase is attributable to growth in our global shared service centers none of our employees is covered under collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategic objectives will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods 

risk management 

invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach we believe a key factor in invescos ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of recent years was our integrated approach to risk management invescos enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business risk 

 

further functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business as a result of our efforts in this area standard  poors ratings services has designated our enterprise risk management rating as strong sp rates companies enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of fair adequate strong and excellent

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated approximately 48  of our total aum were invested in equity securities and approximately 52  were invested in fixed income and other investments at december 31 2015  our aum as of january 31 2016  were 7409 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on 

  

  

actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic and diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets and frontier markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum generally on short notice any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have investments in fixed income assets including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 859 million  or 17  of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

  

  

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the products and accounts that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us or the funds and accounts that we manage to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by our counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets 

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2015  the company had 7839 million  in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip and consolidated sponsored investment products csip 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business increase compliance costs impose additional capital requirements andor involve enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom subsidiaries operating in the european union “eu” are subject to various eu directives which are implemented by member state national legislation our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators and other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on invescos business while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector some will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies including investment managers we may be adversely affected as a result of the new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale or increases the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law in july 2010 while invesco does not believe that the doddfrank act will fundamentally change the investment management 

  

  

industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so moreover the doddfrank act mandated many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation 

in december 2014 sec chair mary jo white announced a comprehensive agenda for regulatory change governing the us asset management industry and directed sec staff to develop a fivepart series of new regulations addressing the topics of enhanced portfolio reporting liquidity risk management leverage and use of derivatives adviser wind up and stress testing for funds and advisers during 2015 the sec proposed new rules for the first three of these initiatives with additional proposals on the remaining agenda items expected in 2016 when finalized during 2016 or later these new industry rules can be expected to add additional reporting and compliance costs and may affect the development of new products and the ability to continue to offer certain strategies through a registered investment company format 

the european union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and compliance costs and will or may continue to do so certain provisions may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business such developments could have similar effects 

developments under regulatory changes will or may include without limitation 

 14 

  

  

 

invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on its business such changes have imposed and may continue to impose new compliance costs andor capital requirements including costs related to information technology systems or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invescos results of operations financial condition or liquidity similarly regulatory enforcement actions which impose significant penalties or compliance obligations or which result in significant reputational harm could have similar material adverse effects on invesco moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment in recent years certain regulatory developments have also added pressures regarding fee levels 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products impair the investment performance of our products or impact our product mix our aggregate aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’  earnings and business considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the capital requirements directive iv crd iv and the internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash 

  

  

between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences   as of december 31 2015 the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 5347 million december 31 2014 4160 million  complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company invesco ltd our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews further as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18   commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain retail shareholder accounts and other clients the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment professionals is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment professionals among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits including equity and other forms of deferred compensation that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing material errors in public reports intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials public relations information social media or other external communications operational failures including cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us continuously to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  

  

  

to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

we have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business however we cannot be assured that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain accounts a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected a payment will typically made into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries or could limit or reduct sales of our products all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

in the current lowinterest rate environment alongside the implementation of significant global quantitative easing policies and volatility in equity markets investors are increasingly attracted to lower fee passive products which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products 

  

  

we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk 

our financial performance depends in part on the companys ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements a failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to manage successfully the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of astable from standard  poors ratings services a2stable from moodys and apositive from fitch ratings as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding total debt of 20728 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to invesco ltd of 78853 million  the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

  

  

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses fund supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if a material portion of our distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

in addition to investment management our services include fund administration sales distribution marketing shareholder servicing and trust custody and other fiduciary services in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business which may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs if our third party 

  

  

service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us it could lead to operational and regulatory problems including with respect to certain of our products which could result in losses enforcement actions or reputational harm and may cause our aum revenue and earnings to decline 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

  

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage any inaccuracies delays systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses andor subject us to reputational harm 

our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems and facilities including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control although we take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems which could materially harm our operations and reputation the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business inability to process client or company transactions and processes breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

  

  

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 61757 million  and 13540 million  respectively at december 31 2015   december 31 2014  65794 million  and 12467 million  respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes from timetotime proposals are introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both more recently there have been numerous proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform 

on october 5 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its final reports related to its action plan for multilateral cooperation to address tax base erosion and profit shifting beps concerns the second phase of the beps project covers clarifications implementation and monitoring countries have already begun to implement some of the action items and will continue to adopt more of them over the next several years as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation countries may also decide to implement their own approaches unilaterally independent of the beps recommendations this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as increase the potential for double taxation 

we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against the company or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his or her duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

the company is organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of the companys assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

  

  

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

global financial markets in 2015 were characterized by increased volatility and renewed uncertainty about the pace of growth in key markets across the global economy the first quarter of 2015 saw positive returns from global equity markets driven by central bank stimulus measures amid uncertainty around the timing of the us federal reserve’s fed interest rate hike the remainder of 2015 saw significant volatility and a broad selloff of equity and commodity assets triggered by a debt crisis in greece and continuing with an economic growth slowdown in china and devaluation of the renminbi financial markets rebounded in the fourth quarter as fears about a further china slowdown tempered and the fed’s first interest rate hike occurred to finish the year with mixed results ongoing favorable monetary policy by the japanese government and central bank led to positive returns in japan with the nikkei 225 index returning 91  a strong finish to 2015 for the us markets could not fully recover declines from early in the year with the sp finishing 2015 down 07  renewed fears of a slowdown in growth in europe and fears of a growth slowdown in china resulted in declines for the ftse 100 which was down 49  and the msci emerging markets which declined 170  

bond markets were likewise volatile during 2015 with the barclay’s us aggregate bond index increasing 06  as market participants favored the relative value of bonds in early 2015 against the backdrop of the fed’s decision to raise interest rates late in the year 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2015  2014  and 2013  



the companys 2015 financial results were significantly negatively impacted by the appreciation of the us dollar as discussed in the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 section below 

throughout 2015 we continued to execute our longterm strategic objectives which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins despite volatile financial markets we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities 

  

  

our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our longterm success    

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

as of the filing of this report invesco held credit ratings of astable a2stable and apositive from standard  poors ratings service sp moodys investor services moodys and fitch ratings fitch respectively during 2015 fitch raised their outlook from stable to positive and stated the outlook revision reflected continued strong operating and investment performance leveling of seed capital investments and an increased focus on organic growth over debtfunded acquisitions 

one of the companys strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform by improving effectiveness and efficiency and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business consistent with this objective business optimization charges of 162 million  were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 including 122 million  of staff severance costs recorded in employee compensation associated with a business transformation initiative this is the first part of a broad program that will continue through 2016 focused on transforming several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient and will leverage shared service centers outsourcing automation of key processes and optimization of the companys office footprint incremental implementation costs in 2016 are estimated to be up to 85 million and the initiative is expected to generate ongoing cost savings that will more than fully offset the implementation expense within a three year time frame after completion 

the investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the us uk and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries conduct investigations and administer examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 include a provision of 126 million  pertaining to regulatory investigations and related legal fees of 05 million this includes 76 million  associated with our private equity business 

in the first quarter of 2015 the company acquired deutsche banks us commodity us etf business for a purchase price composed of contingent consideration payable in future periods during 2015 changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability generated a gain of 271 million  which was recorded in other gains and losses net 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 the company announced that it intends to increase its ownership of religare invesco asset management company our joint venture in india from 49 to 100 the acquisition of this controlling interest is expected to close in early 2016 pending regulatory approvals 

regulators in various jurisdictions have proposed or are exploring changes to the manner in which fund distributers are compensated for the services they provide the uk financial conduct authority fca implemented its retail distribution review “rdr” which is reshaping the manner in which retail investment funds are sold in the uk by changing how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products invesco prepared for the rdr implementation by offering investment funds to uk investors which are priced at a reduced gross management fee but which in turn do not result in the payment by the company of a distribution fee to the intermediary these changes have not had a significant impact to date on net revenues as investors move into these offerings other countries have announced similar distribution fee reviews in the us the sec has previously proposed and may repurpose significant changes to rule 12b1 and may propose other regulatory changes impacting distribution of investment funds 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  impact of consolidated sponsored investment products and consolidated investment products 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1  accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation 

  

  

investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this report as either consolidated sponsored investment products csip which generally include investment products in which invesco holds the majority of the voting rights or partnerships in which the company has substantive equity at risk but in which the other investors lack removal or liquidation rights or consolidated investment products cip which includes consolidated nominallyheld investment products this distinction is important as it differentiates the companys economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in a csip and a cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees the presentation of the grossed up gains and losses arising from the consolidation of nominallyheld cip do not have a significant impact on the companys results of operations liquidity or capital resources gains and losses arising from majorityheld csip could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies note 19  consolidated sponsored investment products and note 20  consolidated investment products for additional information regarding the impact of consolidation of managed funds 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets of the clos would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

 

each of the consolidated financial statement summary sections results of operations balance sheet discussion and liquidity and capital resources begins with a table illustrating the impact of cip relative to the companys consolidated totals the impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  was a reduction  of 392 million  this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products

investment capabilities performance overview 

invescos first strategic objective is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients as of december 31 2015  60 79 and 85 of measured ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a oneyear threeyear and fiveyear basis respectively the table below presents the one three and fiveyear performance of our measured ranked actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and aum in the top half of peer group 1   



 

 

  

  

 assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum includes etfs uits leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee and other passive mandates active aum are total aum less passive aum 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as longterm longterm aum excludes institutional money market and invesco powershares qqq aum longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements the net flows in invesco powershares qqq aum can also be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

changes in aum were as follows 1

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2015  were 7756 billion   december 31 2014  7924 billion  december 31 2013  7787 billion  during the year ended december 31 2015  longterm net inflows   increased  aum by 162 billion  offset by net outflows  of institutional money market funds of 119 billion  and net outflows  of the invesco powershares qqq fund of 18 billion  during the year ended december 31 2014  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 81 billion  offset by net outflows  in institutional money market funds of 58 billion  and the invesco powershares qqq fund of 107 billion  during the year ended december 31 2013  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 217 billion  as well as net inflows in institutional money market funds of 90 billion  and the invesco powershares qqq fund of 37 billion  

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2015  included net longterm active inflows  of 141 billion  and inflows  of passive aum of 21 billion  longterm net inflows were split between our institutional distribution channel of 134 billion  and our retail distribution channel of 28 billion  by asset class longterm net flows were positive for the fixed income alternatives and balanced classes and were negative for the equity asset class longterm net inflows included 83 billion  57 billion  18 billion  and 09 billion  from clients domiciled in continental europe asia the us and the uk respectively offset by longterm outflows of 05 billion  from clients domiciled in canada 

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2014  included net longterm inflows  of passive aum of 60 billion  and active net longterm aum inflows  of 21 billion  net flows in 2014  were split between net inflows of 50 billion  into our retail distribution channel and 31 billion into our institutional distribution channel 2014 flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes and were negative for equity balanced and money market classes longterm net inflows included 160 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe these inflows were largely offset by longterm outflows of 139 billion from clients domiciled in the uk that were dominated by a 131 billion single client withdrawal 

net inflows during the year ended december 31 2013 included net longterm inflows of active aum of 131 billion and passive net longterm aum inflows of 86 billion net flows in 2013 were driven by net inflows of 214 billion into our retail distribution channel primarily in the equity and balanced asset classes 

average aum during the year ended december 31 2015  were 7947 billion  compared to 7903 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  and 7256 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013  

market returns 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis 2015  markets were characterized by increased volatility and uncertainty and results were mixed at yearend with the japanese markets finishing the year strong us markets with modest losses and the uk markets in us dollar terms and emerging markets ended with a larger decline global equity markets were mixed during 2014  with the us market producing a strong return but overseas markets reflecting uncertainty and finishing the year with declines during 2013 equity markets were broadly up across regions 

during the year ended december 31 2015  negative  market movement decreased  aum by 26 billion  with declines in the alternatives fixed income and balanced asset classes partially offset by gains in the equity asset class during the year ended december 31 2014  market gains increased aum by 347 billion  and included 260 billion  in positive market movement of our equity asset class our balanced fixed income and alternative asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market 

  

  

valuations during the period during the year ended december 31 2013  market gains increased aum by 788 billion  and included gains in our equity asset class of 774 billion  

foreign exchange rates 

foreign exchange rate movements in our aum result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as nonus dollar denominated aum is translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company the table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation into the us dollar at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



during the year ended december 31 2015  we experienced decreases  in aum of 160 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates changes in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2015  were driven by the weakening  of the pound sterling the euro canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of aum denominated in these currencies into us dollars 

in the year ended december 31 2014  aum decreased  by 126 billion  due to foreign exchange rate changes driven by the weakening  of the pound sterling the euro canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2013  foreign exchange rate changes decreased aum by 19 billion  driven by the weakening of the canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar partially offset by the strengthening  of the pound sterling and the euro relative to the us dollar 

revenue yield 

net revenue yield on aum increased   01  basis points to 458  basis points in the year ended december 31 2015  from the year ended december 31 2014  level of 457  basis points  december 31 2013  448 basis points excluding performance fees the net revenue yield decreased   02  basis points to 446  basis points in the year ended december 31 2015  from the year ended december 31 2014  level of 448  basis points  december 31 2013  439 basis points 

changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield for example on an asset class basis our equity alternative and balanced aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income aum the combination of average equity average alternative and average balanced aum equated to 677  of total average aum in 2015 very similar to the 676  in 2014  this very similar asset class mix correlates with very little change in net revenue yield in 2015  when compared to 2014  

the tables that follow present aum by total aum and passive aum passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2015  passive aum were 1391 billion  representing 179  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2014  passive aum were 1414 billion  representing 178  of our total aum at that date the decrease in passive aum during 2015  is driven by outflows from the invesco powershares qqq fund and is offset by longterm net inflows the invesco powershares qqq fund aum increased  to 429 billion  at december 31 2015  compared to 407 billion  at december 31 2014   457 billion  at december 31 2013  the revenue yield for invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point reimbursing invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund in the year ended december 31 2015  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 145  basis points compared to 130  basis points in the year ended december 31 2014  an increase  of 15  basis points due to changes in mix of passive aum 

gross revenue yield on aum decreased   05  basis points to 650  basis points in the year ended december 31 2015  from the year ended december 31 2014  level of 655  basis points  december 31 2013  644 basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 2 to the changes in aum table above see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015  compared to december 31 2014  compared to december 31 2013   

to assist in the comparisons the discussion that follows will separate the impact of cip from the overall consolidated results of operations the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  was a reduction  of 392 million  this indicates that the consolidation of cip reduced consolidated revenues by 392 million  reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products the discussion below includes the use of nongaap financial measures see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures 

summary of income statement impact of cip 



  

  

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



 

 

operating revenues decreased  by 05  in the year ended december 31 2015  to 51229 million  year ended december 31 2014  51471 million  net revenues increased  by 10  in the year ended december 31 2015  to 36432 million  year ended december 31 2014  36083 million  operating revenues increased  by 108  in the year ended december 31 2014  to  51471 million  year ended december 31 2013   46446 million  net revenues increased  by 110  in the year ended december 31 2014  to 36083 million  year ended december 31 2013  32520 million  

a significant portion of our business and aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  operating revenues by 2191 million  equivalent to 43  of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2015  when compared to the year ended december 31 2014  292 million increase in 2014  as compared to 2013  or 06 of 2014  total operating revenues 

additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period market movements are discussed in the executive overview section of this managements discussion and analysis during 2015  positive net flows offset by market value changes and foreign exchange losses combined for a 06   increase  in average aum when compared to 2014  

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts other collective investment vehicles and institutional management contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary daily as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional distribution channel are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed 

  

  

investment management fees increased  by 70 million   02  in the year ended december 31 2015  to 40611 million  year ended december 31 2014  40541 million  this correlates with a 06   increase  in average aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by 2087 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  after allowing for foreign exchange movements investment management fees increased by 2157 million the strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling and euro has reduced the weighting of higher fee earning aum attributable to the uk and continental european products in 2015 when compared to 2014 this product mix change has resulted in the increase in management fees lagging the increase in average aum this reduced yield due to the foreign currency mix of aum has been partly offset by the transition during 2014 of our uk business to a single fund management fee as discussed below this transition increased investment management fees and decreased service and distribution fees in 2015 as compared to 2014 by 290 million 

investment management fees increased by 4545 million   126  in the year ended december 31 2014  to  40541 million  year ended december 31 2013   35996 million  the increase compares to a 89   increase  in average aum and a 97   increase  in average longterm aum also contributing to the increase in investment management fees the net revenue yield was higher in the year ended december 31 2014  when compared to the year ended december 31 2013  due to changes in the composition of our aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by 286 million during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  

in april 2014 our uk invesco perpetual business introduced a single fund management fee fmf for their retail funds to replace the separate annual management fee and registration fee the single fmf removes the complexity of having separate elements to the fee structure and is designed to respond to the regulatory policy underlying the uk retail distribution review by providing a clear disclosure of product fees charged to investors this resulted in an increase in investment management fees of 842 million and a corresponding decrease in service and distribution fees as compared to 2013 also contributing to the increase in investment management fees net revenue yield is higher in the year ended december 31 2014 when compared to the year ended december 31 2013 due to changes in the composition of our aum as discussed above 

see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31 2015  december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum 

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in the year ended december 31 2015  service and distribution fees decreased  by 377 million   42  to 8554 million  year ended december 31 2014  8931 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  service and distribution fees by 45 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the decrease in service and distribution fees was 332 million 

the decrease in service and distribution fees during 2015  is due to decreases in administration fees of 192 million distribution and redemption fees of 104 million and transfer agency fees of 36 million these amounts include the impact of a full year of the single fmf in the uk which was effective beginning april 2014 

in the year ended december 31 2014  service and distribution fees increased by 203 million   23  to  8931 million  year ended december 31 2013   8728 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by 04 million during the year ended december 31 2014  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in service and distribution fees was 207 million 

the increase was due primarily to increases in transfer agency fees of 422 million and distribution and redemption fees of 174 million partially offset by a decrease in administration and custodial fees of 390 million included in these figures is the 

  

  

change in 2014 in the uk to a single fmf which resulted in an increase in investment management fees of 842 million and a corresponding decrease in service and distribution fees as compared to 2013 

performance fees 

performance fee revenues including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with method 1 of asc topic 60520s99 “revenue recognition  services  sec materials” cash receipt of performance fees generally occurs after the contractual measurement date however the company may receive from timetotime cash distributions of carried interest before the measurement date such distributions are reflected as deferred carried interest liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect and therefore the company has performance fee arrangements that include monthly quarterly and annual measurement dates given the uniqueness of each transaction performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized the company does not recognize performance fee revenues if there are any future performance contingencies associated with them performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance of our 7756 billion  in aum at december 31 2015  approximately 444 billion  or 57  could potentially earn performance fees 

in the year ended december 31 2015  performance fees increased  by 248 million   406  to 859 million  year ended december 31 2014  611 million  foreign exchange movements decreased  performance fees by 31 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  after allowing for foreign exchange movements performance fees increased by 279 million the performance fees generated in 2015  arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams direct real estate 510 uk equities 254 million asia pacific teams 81 million and global quantitative equity team 56 million 

in the year ended december 31 2014  performance fees increased  by 52 million   93  to  611 million  year ended december 31 2013   559 million  the performance fees generated in 2014  arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams uk equities 356 million direct real estate 98 million asset allocation 32 million asia pacific teams 31 million and the global quantitative equity team 29 million 

the performance fees generated in 2013 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams uk equities 367 million global quantitative equity team 44 million australian equity 34 million direct real estate 16 million and the fixed income team 65 million 

other revenues 

other revenues include fees derived from our uit operations transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds these transaction fees are recorded in our consolidated financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of cip 

in its capacity as sponsor of uits the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of uit products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new uit products these revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute uits to investors 

in the year ended december 31 2015  other revenues decreased  by 183 million   132  to 1205 million  year ended december 31 2014  1388 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  other revenues 28 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the decrease  in other revenues was 155 million  

the decrease in other revenues includes decreases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of 55 million mutual funds front end fees of 37 million uit revenues of 17 million and other revenues of 46 million during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  

  

  

in the year ended december 31 2014  other revenues increased  by 225 million   193  to  1388 million  year ended december 31 2013   1163 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in other revenues by 04 million during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in other revenues was 229 million the increase in other revenues includes increases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of 69 million mutual funds front end fees of 62 million uit revenues of 45 million and other revenues of 61 million partially offset by decreases in transaction commissions of 09 million during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value and apply to much of the companys nonus retail operations where they can also take the form of management fee rebates the revenues from our us retail operations include 12b1 distribution fees which are passed through to brokers who sell the funds as thirdparty distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying aum of the brokers clients thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time these commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses decreased  by 508 million   31  in the year ended december 31 2015  to 15799 million  year ended december 31 2014  16307 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses by 524 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased  by 16 million  the increase includes increases in renewal commissions of 280 million unitary fees of 188 million asset and sales based fees of 123 million and other expenses of 34 million the increases are offset by decreases in rebates of 549 million service fees of 39 million and front end commissions of 21 million 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased by 1415 million   95  in the year ended december 31 2014  to 16307 million  year ended december 31 2013   14892 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses by 95 million during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses was 1320 million the increase includes increases in renewal commissions of 493 million distribution fees of 571 million transfer agent fees of 163 million external commissions of 89 million and administration fees of 08 million the increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of 04 million the overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees and service and distribution fees 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the companys most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49  investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments increased   by   43 million    76  to   610 million   for the year ended   december 31 2015   year ended   december 31 2014    567 million  the   increase   moved in line wit h our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended   december 31 2015  which was   61 billion   compared to   49 billion   at the year ended   december 31 2014  

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments increased by 50 million 97 to 567 million for the year ended december 31 2014  year ended december 31 2013  517 million the increase moved in line with our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2014  which was 49 billion  compared to 40 billion  at the year ended december 31 2013  

  

  

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip increased  by 34 million  to 392 million  in the year ended december 31 2015  year ended december 31 2014  358 million  the increase is due primarily to the impact of newly consolidated funds partially offset by the impact of note paydowns and funds that were liquidated 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased by 25 million to 358 million in the year ended december 31 2014  year ended december 31 2013  383 million the decrease is due primarily to the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of clo notes exceeding the impact of newly consolidated clo notes during the year ended december 31 2014  

once funds are deconsolidated the management and performance fees are no longer eliminated and are reflected in the respective revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income 

operating expenses 

the main categories of operating expenses and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows 



the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2014  resulted in an increase to net income of 111 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net gain is offset by amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests of 33 million resulting in a net increase in net income attributable to invesco ltd of 78 million 

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2013  resulted in an increase to net income of 360 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net gain is offset by amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 447 million resulting in a net decrease in net income attributable to invesco ltd of 87 million

 the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 147 billion  as of december 31 2015  the company has a 49  interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50  joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys consolidated financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

 thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies  revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap 

management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum and the related computation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

  

  

cip revenue 



 acquisitiondisposition related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses costs related to legal settlements of preacquisition matters intangible asset amortization including amortization related to the writeoff of related management contract intangible assets changes in estimates of contingent earnout liabilities booked from prior acquisitions employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities related to a previous acquisition amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and all related tax effects 

while finitelived intangible assets are amortized under us gaap there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in certain qualifying situations these can be amortized for tax purposes generally over a 15year period as is the case in the us these cash flows in the form of reduced taxes payable represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business the company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under us gaap is not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations 

in addition the results of the discontinued operations of atlantic trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted eps accordingly the companys nongaap financial measures reflect only the continuing business of invesco management believes this presentation assists in evaluating the ongoing business performance and aids comparability with peer companies that may not have similar discontinued operations 

transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal regulatory advisory valuation integrationrelated employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees general and administrative costs including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction and the postclosing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings additionally transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closedend funds included in a prior acquisition 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges tax cash flow benefits and other acquisitiondisposition related adjustments as noted above in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related charges 

  

  

see table below for a reconciliation of acquisitiondisposition related items 



 certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically the funds managed by the employee invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment appreciation depreciation is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

  

  

 each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period 



  

  

 operating expenses in 2014 include property related charges of 331 million   2015  44 million  credit associated with vacating leased properties as part of a ongoing location strategy and severance costs of 72 million  related to the initiative 

 operating expenses for 2014 include a charge of 311 million in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the uk financial conduct authority fca pertaining to the companys compliance with certain fca rules and regulations for the period from may 2008 to november 2012 this charge together with settlementrelated legal costs of 05 million has been recorded in general and administrative expense

balance sheet discussion 

a summary of the balance sheet impact of cip is presented below the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on accounts receivable and investments for the year ended december 31 2015  were reductions of 49 million  and 685 million  respectively this indicates that the consolidation of cip reduced accounts receivable and investments by these amounts reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the underlying net interests in cip held by the company 

the majority of the company’s cip are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s direct investments in and management fees generated from clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability as demonstrated by the balance sheet data that follows in this section and in the liquidity and capital resources section inclusion of the longterm debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures such as debttoequity measures causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the item 1 business  risk management section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

  

  

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

   

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 20728 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18  “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

  

  

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2015  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation 

we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15 taxation for additional discussion of these items 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2015  and 2014  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 61757 million  and 65794 million  at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

the october 1 2015  annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2014  annual impairment test fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the 2015  annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant changes in assumptions from 2014  related to an increase in the equity risk premium and weighted average cost of debt which resulted in a discount rate of 116 for the october 1 2015  analysis  2014  111 the discount rates used are estimates of the 

  

  

weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense from continuing operations which was 106 million  126 million  and 154 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2015  and 2014  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

investments 

a significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

  

  

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

we also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above 

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are vies 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns for investment products other than clos involves estimation and probability assumptions for clos there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the clos economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2015  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 53732 million   december 31 2014  51169 million  and voe fund investments of 7191 million   december 31 2014  7302 million as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip however changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests 

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments and also from its contingent consideration liability the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values or the market inputs contributing to the fair value of these financial instruments

million  of these trading investments are held to hedge economically certain deferred compensation plans in which the company participates the company recognizes as compensation expense the appreciation or depreciation of the compensation liability over the awards vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award the company immediately recognizes the appreciation or depreciation of these investments which is included in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income which will reverse and will offset to zero over the life of the award at the end of the multiyear vesting period 

 cash balances invested in money market funds of 3833 million  have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 60515 million  have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2015  the interest rates on 1000  of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 120  years borrowings under the credit facility will have floating interest rates 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31  was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8  “debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the companys only fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2015  are foreign time deposit investments of 247 million   2014  296 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 039   2014  048  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 02 years  2014  03  years 

  

  

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information contains disclosure of revenue from external customers by geography the disclosure of revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling a 10 decline in the pound sterling from the current rate will result in an approximate 56 cent decline in annual earnings per share and an erosion of 1020 basis points of operating margin given this exposure in january 2015 the company entered into a series of outofthe money put option contracts to hedge economically approximately 75 of the foreign currency risk on the translation of its pound sterlingdenominated earnings into us dollars for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 the economic hedge is predominantly triggered upon the impact of a decline in the pound sterlingus dollar foreign exchange rate below 1493 at december 31 2015 a 10 decline in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would result in the put option fair value increasing to approximately 120 million a 10 increase in the pound sterling to us dollar rate would result in the put option fair value decreasing to zero in january 2016 the company entered into a new series of put option contracts to provide coverage from april 2016 through to march 2017 with a strike level set at 14355 in these transactions the reference rate is an average foreign exchange rate for the applicable time frame 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation losses  were 17 million  in 2015   2014  18 million  of gains and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation

the company focuses on four key strategic imperatives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

 

since 2005 when we adopted our strategy to become an integrated global investment manager invesco has taken a number of steps to unify our business and present the organization as a single firm to our clients around the world we believe this work has strengthened invescos ability to meet clients needs and operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 17  geographic 

  

  

information” for a geographic breakdown of our consolidated operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to meet clients demands across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm 

recent developments 

throughout 2014 we continued to execute our longterm strategy which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities our brand our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for longterm success   

in march 2014 leadership of the uk equities team transitioned to mark barnett mr barnett and the team delivered strong investment performance to clients throughout 2014 although we experienced outflows in the uk as a result of the transition dominated by a single client outflow of 131 billion our uk and continental europe business grew and became more diversified throughout 2014 with significant flows into fixed income nonuk equities real estate and multiasset capabilities in particular uk retail achieved a record year of gross sales across a range of capabilities demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business 

invesco achieved solid growth across our global business during 2014 supported by our strong longterm investment performance our comprehensive range of strategies and solutions and our robust client engagement efforts our broadly diversified offering combined with our strong investment performance contributed to an adjusted operating margin of 414  for 2014 up from 397  a year ago also during 2014 we made additional progress against our strategic imperatives launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term more specifically invesco 

 

combined these efforts helped us achieve further growth across our global business by delivering strong investment performance and excellent client service we believe we are in the early stages of achieving the full potential of our global business 

 

 

 

  

  

certain demographic and industry trends 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

 

we believe invesco is poised to take advantage of opportunities created by global demographic and industry trends our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue meeting client needs and strengthening our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and foster our longterm success 

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors we have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in north america europe and asiapacific serving clients in more than 100  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment centers and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management provide us with a competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives as of december 31 2014  485  of our aum were invested in equity securities and 515  in fixed income and other investments  december 31 2013  492  in equity and 508  in fixed income and other investments 

  

  

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from individual corporate clients endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

since 2005 when the company adopted its strategy to become an integrated global investment manager one of the steps we took was to unify the business and present the organization as a single firm to clients around the world these steps included increased efforts to crosssell investment capabilities globally and better integrate internal sales forces as a result the companys retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types therefore not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are retail products and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are institutional products this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate 

the following lists our investment vehicles by distribution channel

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment styles product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategy will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 10 

  

  

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated approximately 49  of our total aum were invested in equity securities and approximately 52  were invested in fixed income and other investments at december 31 2014  our aum as of january 31 2015  were 7865 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and other alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts in addition the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic and diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization and asset confiscation international trading markets particularly emerging markets and frontier markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world 

  

  

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of trustees or directors as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally at december 31 2014  we have 297 million  invested in invesco mortgage capital inc 574 million  of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products and 2187 million of seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 611 million  or 12 of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the products and accounts that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us or the funds and accounts that we manage to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by our counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets 

  

  

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and coinvestments  

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commodities derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and coinvestments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity as of december 31 2014  the company had 7315 million in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip and consolidated sponsored investment products csip 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies subsidiaries operating in the european union “eu” also are subject to various eu directives which are implemented by member state national legislation as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business impose additional capital requirements andor involve enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators and other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on invescos business while many of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector certain of the provisions will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies including investment managers we may be adversely affected as a result of the new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale or increases the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law in july 2010 while invesco does not believe that the doddfrank act will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so furthermore certain provisions including the socalled volker rule appear to be having unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets in addition the scope and impact of many provisions of the doddfrank act will be determined by implementing regulations some of which require lengthy proposal and promulgation periods moreover the doddfrank act mandated many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation 

the european union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and have been are being or will or would be 

  

  

implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and compliance costs and will or may continue to do so certain provisions may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business such developments could have similar effects 

developments under regulatory changes will or may include without limitation 

 14 

  

  

 

invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on its business it is possible such changes could impose new compliance costs or capital requirements including costs related to information technology systems or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invescos results of operations financial condition or liquidity similarly regulatory enforcement actions which impose significant penalties or compliance obligations or which result in significant reputational harm could have similar material adverse effects on invesco moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations including net capital requirements 

substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries ’  earnings and business considerations for example certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the capital requirements directive iv crd iv and the united kingdoms internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences at december 31 2014  the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 9376 million   december 31 2013  6323 million  as of december 31 2014  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 4160 million  december 31 2013 2820 million complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company invesco ltd our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews further as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country at any given time our business operations may be subject to review investigation or disciplinary action for example in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18   commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

  

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain retail shareholder accounts and other clients the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment professionals is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment professionals among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing material errors in public reports operational failures including cyber breaches employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us continuously to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies or fraud or the circumvention of controls and policies could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position 

we have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business however we cannot be assured that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business we are subject to the risk that our employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud including through cyber breaches or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving fraud conflicts of interests or circumvention of policies and controls could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries 

  

  

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain accounts a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

in the current lowinterest rate environment alongside the implementation of significant global quantitative easing policies and volatility in equity markets investors are increasingly attracted to passive products which are gaining share at the expense of active products 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from timetotime have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

  

  

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of astable and a2stable from standard  poors ratings services and moodys respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding total debt of 15893 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to common shareholders of 83084 million  excluding retained earnings appropriated for investors in cip the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses supermarkets regional brokerdealers insurance companies banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these changes continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other unconflicted third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if a material portion of our distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

  

  

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus problems could occur from timetotime due to human error deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal claims and liability which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we depend on information technology and any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities costs and reputational damage 

  

we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and thirdparty information and security technology software applications and other technology systems to operate our business we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them we use our technology to among other things manage and trade portfolio investments support our other operations obtain securities pricing information process client transactions and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage any inaccuracies delays systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses andor subject us to reputational harm 

our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems and facilities including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control although we take protective measures including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses or other events that have a security impact such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance which could materially harm our operations and reputation the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business 

breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information including client data unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business breach and termination of client contracts liability for stolen assets information or identity remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach including damage to systems and recovery of lost data additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents regulatory actions and litigation costs resulting from the incident such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

  

  

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 65794 million  and 12467 million  respectively at december 31 2014   december 31 2013  68673 million  and 12637 million  respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our impairment analysis process 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph however directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

  

  

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

we are organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though we have appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where we have assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

 21 

  

  

a phasedin declassification of our board of directors which will be complete by the 2017 annual general meeting of shareholders 

 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental   authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect   our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes from timetotime proposals are introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd continues to release new proposals as part of its action plan for multilateral cooperation to address tax base erosion and profit shifting beps concerns 

we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 global financial markets in 2014  were characterized by two distinct periods the first half of 2014  saw the continuation of the equity market strength seen in 2013 returns for most equity markets across the globe were positive if not strong driven in part by supportive conditions from global central banks the second half of 2014 saw the return of volatility and selloff of risk assets especially in europe and emerging markets a number of factors contributed to the souring of investor sentiment including geopolitical risks in russia and greece and a genuine deterioration of macroeconomic data in continental europe as a result most european and emerging markets declined in 2014 as seen by the ftse 100 which was down 27  and the msci emerging markets index which declined 46  the us market fell from its highs in mid2014 but still managed an impressive sp 500 return of 114  japan was also positive in 2014 with the nikkei 225 up 71  which was driven by the fiscal and monetary policy actions taken by the japanese government and central bank respectively 

the selloff of risk assets benefited the us treasury market as investors sought the safety of us government bonds yields on the 10 year and 30 year treasury reached historic lows benefiting returns of government bond indices the barclays us aggregate bond index returned 60  for the year 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2014  2013  and 2012  



throughout 2014 we continued to execute our longterm strategy which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment performance and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities our brand our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for longterm success    

as a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our risk management approach we believe a key factor in invescos ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of recent years was our integrated approach to risk management invescos enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business risk 

  

  

 

further functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business as a result of our efforts in this area standard  poors ratings services has designated our enterprise risk management rating as strong 

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

in march 2014 leadership of the uk equities team transitioned to mark barnett mr barnett and the team delivered strong investment performance to clients throughout 2014 although we experienced outflows in the uk as a result of the transition dominated by a single client outflow of 131 billion our uk and continental europe business grew and became more diversified throughout 2014 with significant flows into fixed income nonuk equities real estate and multiasset capabilities in particular uk retail achieved a record year of gross sales across a range of capabilities demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business   

the investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the united states united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations on april 28 2014 the uk financial conduct authority fca announced a penalty of £186 million 311 million related to the settlement of an enforcement proceeding pertaining to the companys compliance with certain fca rules and regulations for the period from may 2008 to november 2012 this charge together with settlementrelated legal costs of 05 million reduced 2014 diluted earnings per share by 007 the company believes its current systems and controls now are adequate and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations 

one of the companys strategic imperatives is to harness the power of our global platform by improving effectiveness and efficiency and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business consistent with this objective during 2014 an initiative was undertaken to align the companys location footprint to reflect current and future business needs this resulted in the company recording business optimization initiative charges of 403 million that include 331 million associated with vacating leased properties and 72 million of staff severance these charges reduced 2014 diluted earnings per share by 007 

during 2014 standard  poors ratings services upgraded the companys senior unsecured debt rating to astable from apositive also during 2014 moodys investors service upgraded their rating of the companys debt to a2stable from a3stable the upgrade reflected moodys view that invesco has broken into the top tier of scaleenabled investment managers the moodys announcement commented that the companys growing market presence broad investment capabilities multifaceted distribution channels and financial flexibility all support this conclusion 

regulators in various jurisdictions have proposed or are exploring changes to the manner in which fund distributers are compensated for the services they provide the uk financial conduct authority implemented its retail distribution review “rdr” which is reshaping the manner in which retail investment funds are sold in the uk by changing how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products invesco prepared for the rdr implementation by offering investment funds to uk investors which are priced at a reduced gross management fee but which in turn do not result in the payment by the company of a distribution fee to the intermediary these changes are not expected to have a significant impact on net revenues as investors move into these offerings other countries have announced similar distribution fee reviews in the us the sec has previously proposed and may repurpose significant changes to rule 12b1 and may propose other regulatory changes impacting distribution of investment funds the markets in financial instruments directive ii “mifid ii” in the eu seeks to promote a single market for wholesale and retail transactions in financial instruments 

  

  

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from timetotime as discussed more fully in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 1  accounting policies  basis of accounting and consolidation 

investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this report as either consolidated sponsored investment products csip which generally include investment products in which invesco holds the majority of the voting rights or partnerships in which the company has substantive equity at risk but in which the other investors lack removal or liquidation rights or consolidated investment products cip which includes consolidated nominallyheld investment products this distinction is important as it differentiates the companys economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in a csip and a cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees gains and losses arising from nominallyheld cip do not have a significant impact on the companys results of operations liquidity or capital resources gains and losses arising from majorityheld csip could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies note 19  consolidated sponsored investment products and note 20  consolidated investment products for additional information regarding the impact of consolidation of managed funds 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys minimal direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

 

each of the consolidated financial statement summary sections results of operations balance sheet discussion and liquidity and capital resources begins with a table illustrating the impact of cip relative to the companys consolidated totals the impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  was a reduction  of 352 million  this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products 

the narrative in each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company before consolidation of cip as well as of the financial statement activity of cip additionally wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and other income and expenses nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented 

  

  

summary operating information 

summary operating information for 2014  2013  and 2012  is presented in the table below 



 

 

  

  

investment capabilities performance overview 

invescos first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients the table below presents the one three and fiveyear performance of our actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and aum in the top half of peer group 1   



 

 

as of december 31 2014  67 77 and 81 of ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a oneyear threeyear and fiveyear basis respectively the uk continental european and global ex us and emerging markets equities have also had strong relative performance with 97 or more of ranked assets beating their benchmark over three and fiveyear periods additionally the uk continental european and global ex us and emerging markets reflect a longterm track record of beating their peers with 98 93 and 98 respectively of ranked assets ahead of peers on a fiveyear basis our balanced asset class reflects strong peer group comparison with 99 of ranked assets in the top half on a fiveyear basis within our fixed income asset class stable value products have achieved excellent longterm performance with 100 of ranked aum ahead of both peers and benchmark on a one three and fiveyear basis 

  

  

 assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum includes etfs uits leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as longterm and shortterm longterm aum excludes institutional money market and invesco powershares qqq aum longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements the net flows in invesco powershares qqq aum can also be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

changes in aum were as follows 1    



 31 

  

  

 

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2014  were 7924 billion   december 31 2013  7787 billion  december 31 2012  6674 billion  during the year ended december 31 2014  longterm net inflows   increased  aum by 81 billion  net outflows  of institutional money market funds were 58 billion  and net outflows  of the invesco powershares qqq fund were 107 billion  during the year ended december 31 2013  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 217 billion  we experienced net inflows  in institutional money market funds of 90 billion  and invesco powershares qqq fund of 37 billion  during the year ended december 31 2013  during the year ended december 31 2012  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 104 billion  we experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of 01 billion  and 02 billion  in invesco powershares qqq fund and net outflows from dispositions of 17 billion during the year ended december 31 2012  

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2014  included net longterm inflows  of passive aum of 60 billion  and active net longterm inflows  of 21 billion  longterm net inflows were split between our retail distribution channel of 50 billion  and our institutional distribution channel of 31 billion  by asset class longterm net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes and were negative for equity balanced and money market classes longterm net inflows included 160 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe these inflows were largely offset by longterm outflows of 139 billion from clients domiciled in the uk that were dominated by a 131 billion single client withdrawal as discussed in the executive overview above net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2013  included net longterm inflows  of passive aum of 86 billion  and active net longterm aum inflows  of 131 billion  net flows in 2013  were driven by net inflows of 214 billion  into our retail distribution channel primarily in the equity and balanced asset classes net flows in 2012 were driven by positive net inflows of 104 billion into our retail distribution channel primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of 107 billion 

average aum during the year ended december 31 2014  were 7903 billion  compared to 7256 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013  and 6453 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012  

market returns 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis global equity markets were mixed during 2014 with the us market producing a strong return but overseas markets reflecting uncertainty and finishing the year with declines during 2013 equity markets were broadly up across regions 

during the year ended december 31 2014  positive  market movement increased  aum by 347 billion  with 260 billion  attributed to our equity asset class our fixed income alternatives and balanced asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period during the year ended december 31 2013  market gains increased aum by 788 billion  and included 774 billion  in positive market movement of our equity asset class our balanced asset class was also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period during the year ended december 31 2012  market gains increased aum by 483 billion and included gains in our equity asset class of 333 billion  

  

  

foreign exchange rates 

foreign exchange rate movements in our aum result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as nonus dollar denominated aum is translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company the table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation into the us dollar at december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



during the year ended december 31 2014  we experienced decreases  in aum of 126 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates changes in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2014  were driven by the weakening  of the pound sterling the euro canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of aum denominated in these currencies into us dollars 

in the year ended december 31 2013  aum decreased  by 19 billion  due to foreign exchange rate changes impacted by the weakening of the canadian dollar and the japanese yen relative to the us dollar partially offset by the strengthening  of the pound sterling and the euro relative to the us dollar these changes were reflected in the translation of aum denominated in these currencies into us dollars during the year ended december 31 2012  foreign exchange rate changes increased  aum by 28 billion  and was driven by the strengthening  of the pound sterling euro and the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar partially offset by the weakening  of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 

revenue yield 

net revenue yield on aum increased   09  basis points to 457  basis points in the year ended december 31 2014  from the year ended december 31 2013  level of 448  basis points december 31 2012 439 basis points excluding performance fees the net revenue yield increased   09  basis points to 448  basis points in the year ended december 31 2014  from the year ended december 31 2013  level of 439  basis points december 31 2012 433 basis points 

changes in our aum mix significantly impact our net revenue yield for example on an asset class basis our equity alternative and balanced aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income aum the combination of average equity average alternative and average balanced aum increased from 651  in 2013  to 676  of total average aum in 2014  the comparable averages for money market and fixed income aum both decreased this change in asset class mix correlates with the increase in net revenue yield in 2014  when compared to 2013  

the tables that follow also analyze aum into active and passive style passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2014  passive aum were 1414 billion  representing 178  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2013  passive aum were 1397 billion  representing 179  of our total aum at that date the increase in passive aum during 2014 is driven by net longterm inflows and market and is offset by outflows from the powershares qqq nasdaq100 index tracking fund the powershares qqq fund aum decreased  to 407 billion  at december 31 2014  compared to 457 billion  at december 31 2013   304 billion  at december 31 2012 the revenue yield for invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point reimbursing invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund in the year ended december 31 2014  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 130  basis points compared to 116  basis points in the year ended december 31 2013  an increase  of 14  basis points due to changes in mix of passive aum 

the net revenue yield before performance fees on active aum increased  from 507  basis points in the year ended december 31 2013  to 518  basis points in the year ended december 31 2014  in 2013 net revenue yield before performance fees on active aum increased over the 2012 level of 503 basis points 

gross revenue yield on aum increased   11  basis points to 655  basis points in the year ended december 31 2014  from the year ended december 31 2013  level of 644  basis points december 31 2012 631 basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 2 to the changes in aum table above see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014  compared to december 31 2013  compared to december 31 2012   

to assist in the comparisons the discussion that follows will separate the impact of cip from the overall consolidated results of operations the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  was a reduction  of 352 million  this indicates that the consolidation of cip reduced consolidated revenues by 352 million  reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products the discussion below includes the use of nongaap financial measures see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



 

 

operating revenues increased  by 108  in the year ended december 31 2014  to 51471 million  year ended december 31 2013  46446 million  net revenues increased  by 110  in the year ended december 31 2014  to 36083 million  year ended december 31 2013  32520 million  operating revenues increased  by 147  in the year ended december 31 2013  to  46446 million  year ended december 31 2012   40504 million  net revenues increased  by 147  in the year ended december 31 2013  to 32520 million  year ended december 31 2012  28360 million  

a significant portion of our business and aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates as noted in the aum discussion a significant amount of our aum by client are domiciled in the uk and while the pound sterlings rate relative to the us dollar weakened during 2014 the average rate during 2014 was stronger than the average rate during 2013 resulting in a positive effect when translating our uk revenue into us dollars when compared to 2013 the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased  operating revenues by 292 million  equivalent to 06  of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2014  when compared to the year ended december 31 2013  474 million decrease in 2013  as compared to 2012  or 1 of 2013  total operating revenues additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period market movements are discussed in the executive overview section of this managements discussion and analysis during 2014  market value increases combined with net new business inflows contributed to a 89   increase  in average aum when compared to 2013  

  

  

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts other collective investment vehicles and institutional management contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary daily as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional distribution channel are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees increased  by 4545 million   126  in the year ended december 31 2014  to 40541 million  year ended december 31 2013  35996 million  this compares to a 89   increase  in average aum and a 97   increase  in average longterm aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by 286 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  after allowing for foreign exchange movements investment management fees increased by 4259 million 

in april 2014 our uk invesco perpetual business introduced a single fund management fee fmf for their retail funds to replace the separate annual management fee and registration fee the single fmf removes the complexity of having separate elements to the fee structure and is designed to respond to the regulatory policy underlying the uk retail distribution review by providing a clear disclosure of product fees charged to investors this resulted in an increase in investment management fees of 842 million and a corresponding decrease in service and distribution fees also contributing to the increase in investment management fees net revenue yield is higher in the year ended december 31 2014  when compared to the year ended december 31 2013  due to changes in the composition of our aum as discussed above see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the year ended december 31 2014  in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum 

investment management fees increased by 4718 million   151  in the year ended december 31 2013  to  35996 million  year ended december 31 2012   31278 million  the increase compares to a 124   increase  in average aum and a 129   increase  in average longterm aum as discussed above the net revenue yield was higher in the year ended december 31 2013  when compared to the year ended december 31 2012  due to changes in the composition of our aum see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the year ended december 31 2013  in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by 413 million during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in the year ended december 31 2014  service and distribution fees increased  by 203 million   23  to 8931 million  year ended december 31 2013  8728 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  service and distribution fees by 04 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in service and distribution fees was 207 million 

the increase in service and distribution fees during 2014 is due primarily to increases in transfer agency fees of 422 million and distribution and redemption fees of 174 million partially offset by decrease in administration and custodial fees of 390 million the fee increases in 2014  are primarily attributable to the increases in average aum as mentioned above the uk business introduced a single fmf in april 2014 this resulted in an increase in investment management fees of 842 million and a corresponding decrease in service and distribution fees 

  

  

in the year ended december 31 2013  service and distribution fees increased by 1012 million   131  to  8728 million  year ended december 31 2012   7716 million  due primarily to increases in distribution and redemption fees of 425 million administration and custodial fees of 496 million and transfer agency fees of 123 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by 32 million during the year ended december 31 2013  the fee increases in 2013 are attributable to the increases in average aum and the expiration of fund waivers 

performance fees 

performance fee revenues including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with method 1 of asc topic 60520s99 “revenue recognition  services  sec materials” cash receipt of performance fees generally occurs after the contractual measurement date however the company may receive from timetotime cash distributions of carried interest before the measurement date such distributions are reflected as deferred carried interest liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect and therefore the company has performance fee arrangements that include monthly quarterly and annual measurement dates given the uniqueness of each transaction performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized the company does not recognize performance fee revenues if there are any future performance contingencies associated with them performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance of our 7924 billion  in aum at december 31 2014  approximately 502 billion  or 63  could potentially earn performance fees 

in the year ended december 31 2014  performance fees increased  by 52 million   93  to 611 million  year ended december 31 2013  559 million  foreign exchange movements increased performance fees by 14 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 after allowing for foreign exchange movements performance fees increased by 38 million 

the performance fees generated in 2014  arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams uk equities 356 million direct real estate 98 million asset allocation 32 million asia pacific teams 31 million and global quantitative equity team 29 million during the year ended december 31 2014 performance fees included 80 million year ended december 31 2013 175 million from edinburgh investment trust plc the company agreed to a reduction in the performance fee receivable from the trust in relation to the trusts year ending march 31 2014 with no performance fees in future years 

in the year ended december 31 2013  performance fees increased  by 145 million   350  to  559 million  year ended december 31 2012   414 million  the performance fees generated in 2013  arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams uk equities 367 million global quantitative equity team 44 million australian equity 34 million direct real estate 16 million and the fixed income team 65 million 

other revenues 

other revenues include fees derived from our uit operations transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds these transaction fees are recorded in our consolidated financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of cip 

in its capacity as sponsor of uits the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of uit products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new uit products these revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute uits to investors 

in the year ended december 31 2014  other revenues increased  by 225 million   193  to 1388 million  year ended december 31 2013  1163 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in other revenues 04 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase  in other revenues was 229 million  

  

  

the increase in other revenues includes increases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of 69 million mutual funds front end fees of 62 million uit revenues of 45 million and other revenues of 61 million partially offset by decreases in transaction commissions of 09 million during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  

in the year ended december 31 2013  other revenues increased  by 67 million   61  to  1163 million  year ended december 31 2012   1096 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in other revenues by 10 million during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in other revenues was 77 million the increase in other revenues included increases in transaction commissions of 20 million generated by our private equity group uit revenues of 35 million mutual fund front end fees of 63 million and other revenues of 11 million partially offset by decreases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of 52 million during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value and apply to much of the companys nonus retail operations where they can also take the form of management fee rebates the revenues from our us retail operations include 12b1 distribution fees which are passed through to brokers who sell the funds as thirdparty distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying aum of the brokers clients thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time these commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased  by 1415 million   95  in the year ended december 31 2014  to 16307 million  year ended december 31 2013  14892 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased  thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses by 95 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase  in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses was 1320 million  the increase includes increases in renewal commissions of 493 million distribution fees of 571 million transfer agent fees of 163 million external commissions of 89 million and administration fees of 08 million the increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of 04 million the overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees and service and distribution fees 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased by 1810 million   138  in the year ended december 31 2013  to 14892 million  year ended december 31 2012   13082 million  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses by 147 million during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes the increase in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses was 1957 million the increase includes increases in renewal commissions of 1094 million distribution fees of 706 million transfer agent fees of 116 million external commissions of 50 million and administration fees of 09 million the increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of 18 million the overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees and service and distribution fees as part of the outsourcing of the uk transfer agency operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense of 153 million in 2012 which impacts the analysis above this additional expense is attributable to periods prior to 2012 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the companys most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49  investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments increased   by   50 million    97  to   567 million   for the year ended   december 31 2014   year ended   december 31 2013    517 million  the   increase   

  

  

moved in line with our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended   december 31 2014  which was   49 billion   compared to   40 billion   at the year ended   december 31 2013  

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments increased by 142 million 379 to 517 million for the year ended december 31 2013  year ended december 31 2012  375 million the increase moved in line with our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2013  which was 40 billion  compared to 30 billion  at the year ended december 31 2012  

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased  by 25 million  to 358 million  in the year ended december 31 2014  year ended december 31 2013  383 million  the decrease is due primarily to the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of clo notes exceeding the impact of newly consolidated clo notes 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased by 27 million to 383 million in the year ended december 31 2013  year ended december 31 2012  410 million the decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended december 31 2013  

once funds are deconsolidated the management and performance fees are no longer eliminated and are reflected in the respective revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income 

operating expenses 

the main categories of operating expenses and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows

nonoperating income and expense of cip 

interest income of cip results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated clos which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated clos and other clo operating expense requirements including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

in the year ended december 31 2014  interest and dividend income of cip increased  by 165 million    87  to   2065 million  year ended december 31 2013  1900 million  interest expense of cip increased  by 106 million    86    to 1339 million  year ended december 31 2013  1233 million  the increase in interest income and interest expense of cip in the 2014 period is due primarily to the impact of consolidation of clo notes issued after september 30 2013 exceeding the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of clo notes 

included in other gainslosses of cip net are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip in the year ended december 31 2014  other gains and losses of cip were a net gain  of 204 million  as compared to a net gain  of 619 million  in the year ended december 31 2013  the net gain  in the 2014  period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of private equity investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the longterm debt of clos and the decrease in market value of clo investments 

in the year ended december 31 2013  interest and dividend income of cip decreased by 685 million 265 to 1900 million year ended december 31 2012  2585 million due primarily to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain clos interest expense of cip decreased by 450 million 267 to 1233 million year ended december 31 2012  1683 million also primarily due to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain clos 

in the year ended december 31 2013  other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of 619 million as compared to a net loss of 977 million in the year ended december 31 2012  the net gain in the 2013  period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of clo and private equity investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the longterm debt of clos 

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

as illustrated in the summary of income statement impact of cip table at the beginning of this results of operations section the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2014  resulted in an increase  to net income of 111 million  before attribution to noncontrolling interests invesco invests in only a portion of these products and as a result this net gain  is offset by amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 33 million  resulting in a net increase  in net income attributable to common shareholders of 78 million  representing the changes in the market value of the companys holding in its consolidated clos which is reclassified into other gainslosses from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation 

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2013  resulted in an increase to net income of 360 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net gain is offset by amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests of 447 million resulting in a net decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of 87 million 

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2012  resulted in a decrease to net income of 1005 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net loss is offset by amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 898 million resulting in a net decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of 107 million 

  

  

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments and debt of cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated financial statements and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition operating results including earnings per share liquidity or capital resources attributable to the companys common shareholders 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate assets under management 

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes income before taxes of cip cip are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level therefore there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of cip accordingly the table included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 15  taxation illustrating the division of incomelosses before taxes between us and foreign is formatted such that the income before taxes of cip is separately stated the commentary below discusses disparities between us and foreign income before taxes in the taxation footnote and us and foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information 

total us income before taxes of 7226 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  includes income before taxes of cip of 630 million  which primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships us income before taxes from cip increased   178 million   394  from 2013  due primarily to greater investment gains generated by these private equity partnerships excluding cip us income before taxes in 2014   increased   1065 million   193  income before taxes in 2014  increased due to a larger increase in us operating revenues 91 than operating expenses and other income and expenses 60 

total foreign income before taxes of 6725 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  includes losses  before taxes of cip of 519 million  which primarily consists of losses from consolidated clos foreign cip pretax losses totaled 519 million  in 2014  compared to pretax losses of 92 million  in 2013  due primarily to greater losses on investments held by the companys consolidated clos in 2014  excluding cip foreign income before taxes increased  by 583 million   88  foreign income before taxes in 2014  increased due to a larger increase in foreign operating revenues 123 than operating expenses 114 slightly offset by a decrease in foreign other income 

total us income before taxes of 5983 million  for the year ended december 31 2013   december 31 2012  5163 million  includes income before taxes of cip of 452 million   december 31 2012  597 million  us income before taxes of cip primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships and for the year ended december 31 2013  was a decrease  of 145 million   243  from 2012  due primarily to lower gains generated by these private equity partnerships excluding cip us income before taxes in 2013   increase d  965 million   211  income before taxes in 2013  had a small decrease contrary to the 132   increase  in us operating revenues due primarily to a legal settlement gain recognized in 2012  

total foreign income before taxes of 6569 million  for the year ended december 31 2013   december 31 2012  3143 million  includes losses  before taxes of cip of 92 million   december 31 2012  income before taxes of cip of 1602 million  foreign income in 2013  decreased more significantly than the 162   increase  in foreign operating revenues during the period due to increased foreign expenses incurred in 2013  such as the 153 million additional distribution fee recorded in the uk as discussed above and expenses incurred in connection with the outsourcing of the european transfer agency 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 280  year ended december 31 2013  268  the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests increased our rate periodoverperiod by 06   03  decrease to the effective tax rate in 2014  and 09  decrease to the effective tax rate in 2013  2014  included rate increases of 05 as result of tax legislation changes in new york and of 06 as a result of the fca settlement also included in 2014  were rate decreases of 05 as a result of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and of 03 as a result of the fund reimbursement expense the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013  decreased to 268  year ended december 31 2012  315  primarily due to income in noncontrolling interests in 2013  versus losses in 2012  the inclusion of noncontrolling interests decreased our effective tax rate by 09  in 2013  and increased our rate 31  in 2012  the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income 

  

  

income from discontinued operations 

on december 31 2013 the company completed the sale of atlantic trust the operating results and the gain associated with the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of invesco comparative periods shown in the consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 22  discontinued operations 

schedule of nongaap information 

we are presenting the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation adjusted diluted earnings per share eps we believe these nongaap measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income and by calculation operating margin net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effect related to reconciling items that are presented net of tax have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation adjusted diluted eps notes to the reconciliations follow the tables

 the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 100 billion  as of december 31 2014  the company has a 49  interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50  joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys consolidated financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation 

  

  

of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

the company also has a joint venture in india which is not included in the proportional consolidation totals above due to the fact that it is not yet deemed significant to the companys operations at this stage of the investment and as a consequence it is not included in the full array of the companys business planning and review processes 

 thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies  revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap 

management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum and the related computation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

cip revenue 



 acquisitiondisposition related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses costs related to legal settlements of preacquisition matters intangible asset amortization including amortization related to the writeoff of related 

  

  

management contract intangible assets changes in estimates of contingent earnout liabilities booked from prior acquisitions employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities related to a previous acquisition amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and all related tax effects 

while finitelived intangible assets are amortized under us gaap there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in certain qualifying situations these can be amortized for tax purposes generally over a 15year period as is the case in the us these cash flows in the form of reduced taxes payable represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business the company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under us gaap is not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations 

in addition the results of the discontinued operations of atlantic trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted eps accordingly the companys nongaap financial measures reflect only the continuing business of invesco management believes this presentation assists in evaluating the ongoing business performance and aids comparability with peer companies that may not have similar discontinued operations 

transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal regulatory advisory valuation integrationrelated employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees general and administrative costs including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction and the postclosing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings additionally transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closedend funds included in a prior acquisition 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges tax cash flow benefits and other acquisitiondisposition related adjustments as noted above in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related charges 

see table below for a reconciliation of acquisitiondisposition related items 



  

  

 certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically the funds managed by the employee invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment appreciation depreciation is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

  

  

 each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period

balance sheet discussion 

a summary of the balance sheet impact of cip is presented below the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on accounts receivable and investments for the year ended december 31 2014  were reductions of 38 million  and 949 million  respectively this indicates that the consolidation of cip reduced accounts receivable and investments by these amounts reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the underlying net interests in cip held by the company 

the majority of the company’s cip are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability as demonstrated by the balance sheet data that follows in this section and in the liquidity and capital resources section inclusion of the longterm debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures such as debttoequity measures causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

• reinvestment in the business 

• moderate annual growth of dividends as further discussed in the dividends section below 

• share repurchase and 

• establishment of an approximate 1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating as of the date of this report invesco held credit ratings of astable and a2stable from standard  poors ratings services sp 

  

  

and moodys respectively furthermore sp considers our risk management to be strong sp rates companies enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of fair adequate strong and excellent our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital such requirements may change from timetotime as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors including balance sheet composition assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives including those arising from the capital requirements directive iv crd iv and the united kingdoms internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences at december 31 2014  the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 9376 million   december 31 2013  6323 million  we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2014  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 4160 million  december 31 2013 2820 million the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 11094 million  at december 31 2014   december 31 2013  7405 million

the consolidation of 56 billion  and 53 billion  of total assets and longterm debt of certain clo products as of december 31 2014  respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the executive overview of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

  

  

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

   

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 15893 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18  “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2014  



  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

  

  

taxation 

we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset the company considers the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods among other factors 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

see also item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in note 15 taxation for additional discussion of these items 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2014  and 2013  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 65794 million  and 68673 million  at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

the october 1 2014  annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2013  annual impairment test fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the 2014 annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant changes in assumptions from 2013  related to a decrease in the equity risk premium and a decrease in beta coefficient market participant average which resulted in a discount rate of 111 for the october 1 2014  analysis  2013  136 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

  

  

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense from continuing operations which was 126 million  154 million  and 255 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2014  and 2013  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

investments 

a significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one three and fiveyear historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets we also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

  

  

we also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above 

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are vies 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns for investment products other than clos involves estimation and probability assumptions for clos there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the clos economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2014  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 51169 million   december 31 2013  42777 million  and voe fund investments of 7302 million   december 31 2013  5122 million as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip however changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests 

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business 

recent accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

 74 

  

  

 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes investments are generally made to establish a track record for a new fund or investment vehicle or to hedge economically exposure to certain deferred compensation plans the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values of these investments 



 75 

  

  

 cash balances invested in money market funds of 4749 million  have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 16979 million  have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2014  the interest rates on 1000  of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 136  years borrowings under the credit facility will have floating interest rates the interest rate profile of the financial assets of the company on december 31 2014  was 



 

 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31  was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8  “debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the companys only fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2014  are foreign time deposit investments of 296 million   2013  288 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 048   2013  068  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 03 years  2013  02  years 

  

  

foreign exchange rate risk 

the company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies these exposures are not actively managed 

the company also has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into us dollars upon consolidation into invesco ltd a strengthening us dollar has a negative impact on the companys foreign currency denominated earnings when presented in us dollars the companys most significant foreign exchange rate risk exposure relates to the translation of pound sterlingdenominated transactions into the us dollar reporting currency item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information contains disclosure of revenue from external customers by geography the disclosure of revenues from external customers earned in the uk is an indicator of the companys exposure to the pound sterling however expenses incurred in the uk provide a natural offset to the companys exposure to the pound sterling a 10 decline in the pound sterling from the current rate will result in an approximate 56 cent decline in annual earnings per share and an erosion of 1020 basis points of operating margin given this exposure in january 2015 the company entered into a series of outofthe money put option contracts to hedge economically approximately 75 of the foreign currency risk on the translation of its pound sterlingdenominated earnings into us dollars for 2015 the economic hedge is predominantly triggered upon the impact of a decline in the pound sterlingus dollar foreign exchange rate below 1493 which could arise as a result of european economic uncertainty 

the company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the consolidated statements of income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies net foreign exchange revaluation gains  were 18 million  in 2014   2013  08 million  of losses and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses net on the consolidated statements of income we continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation

strategy 

the company focuses on four key strategic objectives that are designed to further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

 

since 2005 when we adopted our strategy to become an integrated global asset manager invesco has taken a number of steps to unify our business and present the organization as a single firm to our clients around the world we believe this work has strengthened invescos ability to operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 17  geographic information” for a geographic breakdown of our consolidated operating revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  

  

one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain wellperforming investment capabilities the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm as an example real estate securities and reits managed in dallas were first introduced to the us institutional and retail markets in 1988 a few years later we saw demand for this highly marketable capability in japan and australia and made it available to investors through mutual funds in those markets we introduced our reit capability to the european crossborder market in august 2005 and to the canadian retail market in 2007 we have also had success expanding our industryleading balanced risk allocation capability globally while this capability was initially created for institutional clients in the us market invesco quickly expanded to the retail market with mutual funds in the us and in the crossborder market in 2013 invesco further expanded its multiasset capability with the addition of a dedicated multiasset team in the uk 

recent developments 

throughout 2013 we continued to execute our longterm strategy which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment reputation and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and continued to invest in our products and capabilities our brand our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for longterm success in late 2013 we launched the global targeted return product line with strong flows to the new fund in the uk market in the fourth quarter in addition late in 2013 we launched a number of new liquid alternative capabilities these capabilities leverage the firms 25 years of experience managing alternative assets to bring existing institutionalquality alternative investment capabilities to our retail clients the company launched more funds in the fourth quarter of 2013 than in any year within the last five years   

on october 15 2013 the company announced that the head of uk equities neil woodford will be leaving on april 29 2014 mark barnett will succeed mr woodford as head of uk equities as of december 31 2013 mr woodford was the named lead manager for uk equity aum totaling 466 billion between october 15 2013 and december 31 2013 uk equity income aum experienced net outflows of 48 billion  our total aum in emea europe middle east and africa at december 31 2013 was 1719 billion excluding the net outflows from uk equity income emea longterm net inflows for the fourth quarter of 2013 were 43 billion 

on december 31 2013 the company completed the sale of atlantic trust private wealth management atlantic trust to canadian imperial bank of commerce cibc the transaction offered compelling advantages to the shareholders of invesco including improved allocation of capital and resources to support future growth of our core investment management business and immediate expansion of the companys net operating margin the results of atlantic trust together with expenses and gain associated with the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of invesco comparative periods shown in the consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation similarly total aum excludes the aum of atlantic trust with comparative periods adjusted to a consistent basis 

invescos continued progress against a multiyear strategy set a firm foundation for the companys many achievements throughout the year specifically the firm 

 

together these efforts drove meaningful organic growth across the firm with positive net flows of 344 billion  for our business in 2013  

 

 5 

  

certain demographic and industry trends 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

 

we believe invesco is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by global demographic and industry trends our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue building our business and strengthening our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and foster our longterm success 

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors we have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in north america europe and asiapacific serving clients in more than 100  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment centers and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management provide us with a competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market balanced equity fixed income and alternatives approximately 49  of our aum as of december 31 2013  were invested in equity securities and 51  in fixed income and other investments  december 31 2012  443  in equity and 557  in fixed income and other investments 

  

the following sets forth our managed investment objectives by asset class 



distribution channels 

retail aum originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units institutional aum originates from individual corporate clients endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities aum disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated aum distributed by type of sales team the companys internal distribution channels aum amounts disclosed as retail channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys retail sales team whereas aum amounts disclosed as institutional channel aum represents aum distributed by the companys institutional sales team 

since 2005 when the company adopted its strategy to become an integrated global asset manager one of the steps taken was to unify the business and present the organization as a single firm to clients around the world these efforts included increased efforts to crosssell investment capabilities globally and better integrate internal sales forces as a result the companys retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types therefore not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are retail products and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are institutional products this aggregation however is viewed as a proxy for presenting aum in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate 

retail 

invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets including the us uk canada continental europe and asia retail aum was 5196 billion  at december 31 2013  we offer retail products within all of the major asset classes our retail products are primarily distributed through thirdparty financial intermediaries including traditional brokerdealers fund “supermarkets” retirement platforms financial advisors banks insurance companies and trust companies 

the uk us and canadian retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2013  invesco perpetual was one of the largest retail fund providers in the uk invescos us retail business was among the 10 largest nonproprietary fund complexes in the us by longterm assets including the invesco powershares franchise and invesco canada was among the top 10 largest retail fund managers in canada by longterm assets invesco great wall our joint venture in china was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 101 billion  as of december 31 2013  we provide our retail clients with one of the industrys most robust and comprehensive product lines 

  

institutional 

we provide investment solutions to institutional investors globally with a major presence in the us uk continental europe and asia with 2591 billion  in aum as of december 31 2013  we offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies including traditional equities structured equities fixed income including money market funds for institutional clients real estate private equity distressed equities financial structures and absolute return strategies regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world we have a diversified client base that includes major public entities corporations unions nonprofit organizations endowments foundations pension funds and financial institutions invescos institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the world 

the following lists our investment vehicles by distribution channel 



aum diversification 

one of invescos greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class our distribution network has attracted assets of 67  retail and 33  institutional as of december 31 2013  by client domicile 33  of client aum are outside the us and we serve clients in more than 100  countries the following tables present a breakdown of aum by client domicile distribution channel and asset class as of december 31 2013  additionally the fourth table below illustrates the split of our aum as passive and active passive aum includes etfs unit investment trusts uits leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

  









  

employees 

as of december 31 2013  on a continuing operations basis the company had 5932  employees across the globe as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had 5889  and 5917  employees respectively as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had 6128  and 6162  employees including employees of the atlantic trust business respectively none of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment styles product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute andor service those products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategy will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 10 

  

if the nav of one of our money market funds were to decline below 100 per share such funds could experience significant redemptions in aum loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm regulators in the us have proposed mandating a variable “floating” nav for money market funds 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated approximately 49  of our total aum were invested in equity securities and approximately 51  were invested in fixed income and other investments at december 31 2013  our aum as of january 31 2014  were 7649 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income stable return accounts and certain etfs our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

on october 15 2013 the company announced that the head of uk equities neil woodford will be leaving on april 29 2014 mark barnett will succeed mr woodford as head of uk equities as of december 31 2013 mr woodford was the named lead manager for uk equity aum totaling 466 billion between october 15 2013 and december 31 2013 uk equity income aum experienced net outflows of 48 billion   

investments in international markets  investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political economic and diplomatic developments currency fluctuations social instability changes in governmental policies expropriation nationalization asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to nonus ownership international trading markets particularly emerging markets and frontier markets are often smaller less liquid less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the us 

  

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally at december 31 2013  we have 282 million  invested in invesco mortgage capital inc 384 million  of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products and 1003 million seed money in fixed income funds the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 559 million  or 12 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we and the products and accounts that we manage have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us or the funds and accounts that we manage to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by our counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets 

  

our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and partnership investments  

the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products commoditized derivatives and similar financial instruments private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and partnership investments a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2013 the company had 5287 million in seed capital and coinvestments including direct investments in consolidated investment products cip and consolidated sponsored investment products csip 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies subsidiaries operating in the european union “eu” also are subject to various eu directives which are implemented by member state national legislation as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business impose additional capital requirements andor involve enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec financial industry regulatory authority finra the commodities future trading commission cftc the national futures association nfa and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ in the united states and by the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulatory authority pra in the united kingdom our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators and other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on invescos business while many of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector certain of the provisions will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies including investment managers we may be adversely affected as a result of the new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law on july 21 2010 while invesco does not believe that the doddfrank act will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs and will or may continue to do so furthermore certain provisions including the socalled volker rule may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets in addition the scope and impact of many provisions of the doddfrank act will be determined by implementing regulations some of which require lengthy proposal and promulgation periods moreover the doddfrank act mandated many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation as a result of these uncertainties regarding implementation of the doddfrank act and such other future potential legislative or regulatory changes the full impact of the doddfrank act on the investment management industry and invesco cannot be fully understood at this time 

  

the european union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and have been are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but certain provisions have required and other provisions will or may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also have increased regulatory burdens and compliance costs and will or may continue to do so certain provisions may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business such developments could have similar effects 

developments under regulatory changes may include without limitation

the enforcement division of the fca is conducting an ongoing review of certain matters pertaining to the company’s compliance with fca rules and regulations for the period may 2008 to november 2012 the company is cooperating fully with the fca review and is seeking to resolve this investigation on a consensual basis although there can be no assurance that the companys efforts to do so will succeed the company believes that its current systems and controls now are adequate and in compliance with applicable regulations the company is not able at this time to estimate the amount of any potential fine arising from the resolution of this matter however the company believes that any fine would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity 

invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible other enforcement proceedings on its business it is possible such changes could impose new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invescos results of operations financial condition or liquidity similarly regulatory enforcement actions which impose significant penalties or compliance obligations or which result in significant reputational harm could have similar material adverse effects on invesco moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital and such capital requirements may be increased from timetotime these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities at december 31 2013  our minimum net capital requirements aggregated to approximately 282 million  a subgroup of invesco subsidiaries including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2013  the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 6323 million   december 31 2012  5283 million  complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company invesco ltd 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18  commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the enforcement division of the fca is conducting an ongoing review of certain matters pertaining to the company’s compliance with fca rules and regulations for the period may 2008 to november 2012 the company is cooperating fully with the fca review and is seeking to resolve this investigation on a consensual basis although there can be no assurance that the companys efforts to do so will succeed the company believes that its current systems and controls now are adequate and in compliance with applicable regulations the company is not able at this time to estimate the amount of any potential fine arising from the resolution of this matter however the company believes that any fine would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity 

  

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states we have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing operating and marketing our international operations our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of key individuals or significant investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

on october 15 2013 the company announced that the head of uk equities neil woodford will be leaving on april 29 2014 mark barnett will succeed mr woodford as head of uk equities as of december 31 2013 mr woodford was the named lead manager for uk equity aum totaling 466 billion between october 15 2013 and december 31 2013 uk equity income aum experienced net outflows of 48 billion   

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing material errors in public reports employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed 

our business also requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or contractual requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with and engage in potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3stable and apositive from moodys and standard  poors ratings services respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

  

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2013  we had outstanding total debt of 15886 million  excluding debt of cip and total equity attributable to common shareholders of 83926 million  excluding retained earnings appropriated for investors in cip the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these trends continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other unconflicted third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if a material portion of our distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

  

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers these systems or service providers could suffer deficiencies failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we believe our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems should mitigate adverse impacts nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we generally do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 68673 million  and 12637 million  respectively at december 31 2013   december 31 2012  70482 million  and 12877 million  respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our goodwill impairment analysis process 

  

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda however the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a companys name to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the companys corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the memorandum of association or byelaws furthermore consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

our byelaws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act 

because we are incorporated in bermuda it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 

we are organized under the laws of bermuda in addition certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though we have appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 

further it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where we have assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states 

  

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

specifically our byelaws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company 

 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental   authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect   our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2013  economies in the developed world continued to show improvement resulting in strong equity market gains equity markets such as the us japan and the uk produced positive returns as evidenced by the sp 500 index which was up 296  the nikkei 225 index which increased 567  and the ftse 100 which rose 144  however developing markets lagged in 2013 as questions about the impact of slowing monetary stimulus on emerging economies weighed on equity prices resulting in the msci emerging market index declining 50  bond markets declined in 2013 as evidenced by the barclays us aggregate bond index driven in part by a change in the us federal reserves monetary policy the expectation of a tapering in the monthly bond purchases resulted in pressure on bond prices this was confirmed in december 2013 when the federal reserve announced a reduction in the monthly purchases from 85 billion to 75 billion 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciationdepreciation of several major market indices for 2013  2012  and 2011  



throughout 2013 we continued to execute our longterm strategy which further improved our ability to serve clients strengthened our investment reputation and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and continued to invest in our products and capabilities our brand our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for longterm success in late 2013 we launched the global targeted return product line with strong flows to the new fund in the uk market in the fourth quarter in addition late in 2013 we launched a number of new liquid alternative capabilities these capabilities leverage the firms 25 years of experience managing alternative assets to bring existing institutionalquality alternative investment capabilities to our retail clients the company launched more funds in the fourth quarter of 2013 than in any year within the last five years    

as a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our risk management approach we believe a key factor in invescos ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management invescos enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business risk 

 

further functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business as a result of our efforts in this area standard  poors ratings services has designated our enterprise risk management rating as strong 

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the 

  

world this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

on october 15 2013 the company announced that the head of uk equities neil woodford will be leaving on april 29 2014 mark barnett will succeed mr woodford as head of uk equities as of december 31 2013 mr woodford was the named lead manager for uk equity aum totaling 466 billion between october 15 2013 and december 31 2013 uk equity income aum experienced net outflows of 48 billion  our total aum in emea at december 31 2013 is 1719 billion excluding the net outflows from uk equity income emea long term net inflows for the fourth quarter of 2013 were 43 billion 

on december 31 2013 the sale of atlantic trust to cibc was completed the results of atlantic trust together with expenses associated with the sale and the gain on the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of invesco comparative periods shown in the consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation similarly total aum excludes the aum of atlantic trust with comparative periods adjusted to a consistent basis 

regulators in various jurisdictions have proposed or are exploring changes to the manner in which fund distributers are compensated for the services they provide the uk financial conduct authority has implemented its retail distribution review “rdr” which is expected to reshape the manner in which retail investment funds are sold in the uk by changing how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products invesco has prepared for the rdr implementation by offering investment funds to uk investors which are priced at a reduced gross management fee but which in turn do not result in the payment by the company of a distribution fee to the intermediary these changes are not expected to have a significant impact on net revenues as investors move into these offerings in the us the sec has previously proposed and may repurpose significant changes to rule 12b1 other countries have announced similar distribution fee reviews 

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products 

investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this report as either consolidated sponsored investment products csip which generally includes consolidated majorityheld sponsored investment products or consolidated investment products cip which includes consolidated nominallyheld investment products this distinction is important as it differentiates the companys economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund the companys economic risk with respect to each investment in a csip and a cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management fees gains and losses arising from nominallyheld cip do not have a significant impact on the companys results of operations liquidity or capital resources gains and losses arising from majorityheld csip could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies note 19  consolidated sponsored investment products and note 20  consolidated investment products for additional information regarding the impact of consolidation of managed funds 

the majority of the companys cip balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys minimal direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

  

the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company’s consolidated financial statements but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections which follow after the assets under management discussion 

 

each of the consolidated financial statement summary sections results of operations balance sheet discussion and liquidity and capital resources begins with a table illustrating the impact of cip relative to the companys consolidated totals the impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  was a reduction  of 379 million  this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products 

the narrative in each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company before consolidation of cip as well as of the financial statement activity of cip additionally wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and other income and expenses nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented

investment capabilities performance overview 

invescos first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients the table below presents the one three and fiveyear performance of our actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and aum in the top half of peer group 1   



 

 

as of december 31 2013 72 83 and 62 of ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a oneyear threeyear and fiveyear basis respectively within our equity asset class the performance of canadian equities continued to improve in both the benchmark and peer group comparisons the uk continental european and global ex us and emerging markets equities have also had strong relative performance with 86 or more of assets beating their benchmark over three and fiveyear periods additionally continental european and global ex us and emerging markets reflect strong performance with 94 and 97 respectively of assets beating peers on a fiveyear basis the uk shows solid improvement during the one and threeyear basis as a comparison to peer group from a brief period in which we trailed the market during 2009 in the fiveyear comparison our balanced asset class reflects strong peer group comparison with 97 in the top half on both the three and fiveyear basis within our fixed income asset class stable value products have achieved excellent longterm performance with 100 of aum ahead of benchmark on a one three and fiveyear basis 

  

assets under management 

the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum passive aum includes etfs uits leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as longterm and shortterm shortterm aum includes institutional money market and invesco powershares qqq aum longterm aum is total aum less shortterm aum longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds longterm outflows reflect client redemptions from accountsfunds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements the net flows in invesco powershares qqq aum can also be relatively shortterm in nature and due to the relatively low revenue yield these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield 

changes in aum were as follows 1

operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from cip however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the companys true effective fee rate from aum 

 

flows 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2013  were 7787 billion   december 31 2012  6674 billion  december 31 2011  6073 billion  during the year ended december 31 2013  longterm net inflows   increased  aum by 217 billion  net inflows  of shortterm aum included institutional money market funds of 90 billion  and net inflows  in invesco powershares qqq fund of 37 billion  during the year ended december 31 2012  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 104 billion  we experienced net inflows  in institutional money market funds of 01 billion  and invesco powershares qqq fund of 02 billion  and net outflows  from dispositions of 17 billion  during the year ended december 31 2012  during the year ended december 31 2011  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 147 billion  we experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of 53 billion  and 31 billion  in invesco powershares qqq fund during the year ended december 31 2011  

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2013  included net longterm inflows  of passive aum of 86 billion  and active net longterm inflows  of 131 billion  net flows were driven by net inflows into our retail distribution channel of 214 billion  primarily in the equity and balanced asset classes this is the first year since 2009 that net longterm flows have been positive into the equity class of assets net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2012  included net longterm inflows  of passive aum of 109 billion  and active net longterm aum outflows  of 05 billion  net flows in 2012  were driven by net inflows of 104 billion  into our retail distribution channel primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of 107 billion  net inflows during the year ended december 31 2011 included net longterm inflows of passive aum of 144 billion  net flows in 2011 were driven by positive net inflow of 60 billion into our retail and 87 billion into institutional distribution channels primarily in the fixed income asset class while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of 114 billion 

average aum during the year ended december 31 2013  were 7256 billion  compared to 6453 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012  and 6178 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  

market returns 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis global equity markets produced strong returns during both the year ended december 31 2013  and the year ended december 31 2012 contrasting with an overall decline experienced in the year ending december 31 2011 

during the year ended december 31 2013  positive  market movement increased  aum by 788 billion  with 774 billion  attributed to our equity asset class our balanced asset class was also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period during the year ended december 31 2012  market gains increased aum by 483 billion  and included 333 billion  in positive market movement of our equity asset class our fixed income balanced and alternatives asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period market losses during the year ended december 31 2011  decreased the value of our equity asset class by 150 billion  decreasing in line with equity markets globally 

  

foreign exchange rates 

foreign exchange rate movements in our aum result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as nonus dollar denominated aum is translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company the table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation into the us dollar at december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  



during the year ended december 31 2013  we experienced decreases  in aum of 19 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates changes in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2013  were driven primarily by the weakening  of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of canadian dollarbased aum into us dollars and the weakening  of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our yenbased aum into us dollars partially offset by the strengthening  of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased aum into us dollars and the strengthening  of the euro relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our eurobased aum into us dollars 

in the year ended december 31 2012  aum increased  by 28 billion  due to foreign exchange rate changes impacted by the strengthening  of the pound sterling canadian dollar and the euro relative to the us dollar partially offset by the weakening  of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2011  foreign exchange rate changes decreased  aum by 04 billion  and was driven by the weakening  of the pound sterling canadian dollar and the euro relative to the us dollar offset by the strengthening  of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 

revenue yield 

net revenue yield on aum increased   09  basis points to 448  basis points in the year ended december 31 2013  from the year ended december 31 2012  level of 439  basis points excluding performance fees the net revenue yield increased   06  basis points to 439  basis points in the year ended december 31 2013  from the year ended december 31 2012  level of 433  basis points 

changes in our aum mix significantly impact our net revenue yield for example on an asset class basis our equity and balanced aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income aum the combination of average equity and average balanced aum increased from 507  in 2012  to 534  of total average aum in 2013  the comparable averages for money market and fixed income aum both reduced this change in asset class mix correlates with the increase in net revenue yield in 2013 when compared to 2012 

the tables that follow also analyze aum into active and passive style passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2013  passive aum were 1397 billion  representing 179  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2012  passive aum were 1140 billion  representing 171  of our total aum at that date in the year ended december 31 2013  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 116  basis points compared to 93  basis points in the year ended december 31 2012  an increase  of 23  basis points due to changes in mix of passive aum the increase in the average yield from passive aum in 2013 when compared to 2012 has offset any reduction in total net revenue yield normally associated with the higher level of passive aum as a percentage of total aum 

the net revenue yield before performance fees on active aum increased  from 503  basis points in the year ended december 31 2012  to 507  basis points in the year ended december 31 2013  in 2012 net yield decreased by 13  basis points from 2011 due to the higher proportion of passive aum combined with the lower yield earned by passive aum 

the increase in passive aum includes the movements in the powershares qqq nasdaq100 index tracking fund the powershares qqq fund aum increased  to 457 billion  at december 31 2013  compared to 304 billion  at december 31 2012  and accounts for 153 billion  of the 257 billion  increase in passive aum the revenue yield for invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point reimbursing invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund and flows into and out of this product therefore have a significant impact on the overall net revenue yield and are a significant factor in the yearonyear yield changes 

  

gross revenue yield on aum increased   13  basis points to 644  basis points in the year ended december 31 2013  from the year ended december 31 2012  level of 631  basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 2 to the changes in aum table above see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013  compared to december 31 2012  compared to december 31 2011   

to assist in the comparisons the discussion that follows will separate the impact of cip from the overall consolidated results of operations the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  was a reduction  of 379 million  this indicates that the consolidation of cip reduced consolidated revenues by 379 million  reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products the discussion below includes the use of nongaap financial measures see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



operating revenues increased  by 147  in the year ended december 31 2013  to 46446 million  year ended december 31 2012  40504 million  net revenues increased  by 147  in the year ended december 31 2013  to 32520 million  year ended december 31 2012  28360 million  operating revenues increased  by 17  in the year ended december 31 2012  to  40504 million  year ended december 31 2011   39823 million  net revenues increased  by 16  in the year ended december 31 2012 to 28360 million  year ended december 31 2011  27916 million  net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements plus management and performance fees earned from less other revenues recorded by cip plus other reconciling items see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

a significant portion of our business and aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  operating revenues by 474 million  equivalent to 10  of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2013  when compared to the year ended december 31 2012  208 million decrease in 2012  as compared to 2011  or 05 of 2012  total operating revenues additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from most global capital markets increased in the year ended december 31 2013  these market value increases combined with net new business inflows contributed to a 124 increase  in average aum for 2013 when compared to 2012 

the company acquired morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” on june 1 2010 as part of the acquisitionrelated us mutual fund product alignment certain 1 year and 2 year fee waivers were agreed between the company and the fund boards which reduced the company’s annual management fees by approximately 30 million commencing june 1 2011 these fee waivers began to expire during mid2012 and have fully lapsed by the end of 2013 

  

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts and institutional management contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary daily as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional distribution channel are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees increased  by 4718 million   151  in the year ended december 31 2013  to 35996 million  year ended december 31 2012  31278 million  this compares to a 124   increase  in average aum and a 129   increase  in average longterm aum as discussed above the net revenue yield is higher in the year ended december 31 2013  when compared to the year ended december 31 2012  due to changes in the composition of our aum in addition management fees were reduced commencing in june 2011 due to acquisition integrationrelated us mutual fund mergers and continuing through mid2012 negatively impacting yields in 2012 as compared to 2013 see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the year ended december 31 2013  in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by 413 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  

investment management fees increased by 871 million   29  in the year ended december 31 2012  to  31278 million  year ended december 31 2011   30407 million  the increase compares to a 45   increase  in average aum and a 36   increase  in average longterm aum as discussed above the net revenue yield was lower in the year ended december 31 2012 when compared to the year ended december 31 2011 due to changes in the composition of our aum in addition as mentioned above management fees were reduced commencing in june 2011 due to acquisition integrationrelated us mutual fund mergers some of these fee waiver agreements lapsed in mid2012 benefiting revenue in the second half of 2012 see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the year ended december 31 2012 in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by 179 million 206 of the increase during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in the year ended december 31 2013  service and distribution fees increased  by 1012 million   131  to 8728 million  year ended december 31 2012  7716 million  due primarily to increases in distribution and redemption fees of 425 million administration and custodial fees of 496 million and transfer agency fees of 123 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased  service and distribution fees by 32 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  the fee increases in 2013 are attributable to the increases in average aum and the expiration of fund waivers noted above

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments

management performance and other fees earned from cip 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased  by 27 million  to 383 million  in the year ended december 31 2013  year ended december 31 2012  410 million  the decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended december 31 2012  once the funds are deconsolidated the management and performance fees are no longer eliminated and are reflected in the respective revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income

nonoperating income and expense of cip 

interest income of cip results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated clos which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated clos and other clo operating expense requirements including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

in the year ended december 31 2013  interest and dividend income of cip decreased  by 685 million   265  to 1900 million  year ended december 31 2012  2585 million  primarily due to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain clos interest expense of cip decreased  by 450 million   267  to 1233 million  year ended december 31 2012  1683 million  also primarily due to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain clos 

included in other gainslosses of cip net are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip in the year ended december 31 2013  other gains and losses of cip were a net gain  of 619 million  as compared to a net loss  of 977 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  the net gain  in the 2013  period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of clo and private equity investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the longterm debt of clos 

in the year ended december 31 2012  interest income of cip decreased by 487 million 159 to 2585 million year ended december 31 2011  3072 million primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain clo products in the year as well as the impact of certain clos entering their amortization period interest expense of cip decreased by 187 million 100 to 1683 million year ended december 31 2011  1870 million primarily due to clo deconsolidation upon deconsolidation the operating activities of the managed fund no longer gross up the consolidated statements of income

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

as illustrated in the summary of income statement impact of cip table at the beginning of this results of operations section the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2013  resulted in an increase  to net income of 360 million  before attribution to noncontrolling interests invesco invests in only a portion of these products and as a result this net gain  is offset by noncontrolling interests of 447 million  resulting in a net decrease  in net income of the company of 87 million  

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2012  resulted in a decrease to net income of 1005 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of 898 million resulting in a net decrease in net income of the company of 107 million 

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2011  resulted in a decrease to net income of 874 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of 1076 million resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of 202 million 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the companys consolidated statements of income generally offset the gains and losses interest income and interest expense of cip 

additionally cip represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate assets under management 

  

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes income before taxes of cip cip are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level therefore there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of cip accordingly the table included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 15  taxation illustrating the division of incomelosses before taxes between us and foreign is formatted such that the income before taxes of cip is separately stated the commentary below discusses disparities between us and foreign income before taxes in the taxation footnote and us and foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 17  geographic information 

total us income before taxes of 5983 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  includes income before taxes of cip of 452 million  which primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships us income before taxes from cip decreased   145 million   243  from 2012  due primarily to lower investment gains generated by these private equity partnerships excluding cip us income before taxes in 2013   increased   965 million   211  income before taxes in 2013  increased due to a larger increase in us operating revenues 128 than operating expenses and other income and expenses 98 

total foreign income before taxes of 6569 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  includes losses  before taxes of cip of 92 million  which primarily consists of losses from consolidated clos foreign cip pretax losses totaled 92 million  in 2013  compared to pretax losses of 1602 million  in 2012  primarily due to lower losses on investments held by the companys consolidated clos in 2013 and the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain clos excluding cip foreign income before taxes increased  by 1916 million   404  foreign income in 2013   increased  more significantly than the 162   increase  in foreign operating revenues due to decreased foreign expenses incurred in 2013  such as the 153 million additional distribution fee recorded in 2012 in the uk as discussed above and the completion of the outsourcing of the european transfer agency and related expenses 

total us income before taxes of 5163 million  for the year ended december 31 2012   december 31 2011  5634 million  includes income before taxes of cip of 597 million   december 31 2011  930 million  us income before taxes of cip primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships and for the year ended december 31 2012  was a decrease  of 333 million   358  from 2011  due primarily to lower gains generated by these private equity partnerships excluding cip us income before taxes in 2012   decrease d  138 million   29  income before taxes in 2012 had a small decrease contrary to the 43   increase  in us operating revenues due primarily to a legal settlement gain recognized in 2011 

total foreign income before taxes of 3143 million  for the year ended december 31 2012   december 31 2011  3287 million  includes losses  before taxes of cip of 1602 million   december 31 2011  income before taxes of cip of 1804 million  foreign income in 2012 decreased more significantly than the 08   decrease  in foreign operating revenues during the period due to increased foreign expenses incurred in 2012 such as the 153 million additional distribution fee recorded in the uk as discussed above and expenses incurred in connection with the outsourcing of the european transfer agency 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013  decreased to 268  year ended december 31 2012  315  primarily due to income in noncontrolling interests in 2013  versus losses in 2012  the inclusion of noncontrolling interests decreased our effective tax rate by 09  in 2013  and increased our rate 31  in 2012  the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012  increased to 315  year ended december 31 2011  314  due to a smaller impact from losses in noncontrolling interests in 2012  versus income in 2011  the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate by 31  in 2012  and 34  in 2011  the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income the 2011  rate reflects a favorable impact from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions as a result of the statute of limitation closing 

income from discontinued operations 

on december 31 2013 the company completed the sale of atlantic trust the operating results and the gain associated with the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of invesco comparative periods shown in the consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 23  discontinued operations 

  

schedule of nongaap information 

we are presenting the following nongaap performance measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation adjusted diluted earnings per share eps we believe these nongaap measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income and by calculation operating margin net income and by calculation diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate the tax effect related to reconciling items that are presented net of tax have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation adjusted diluted eps notes to the reconciliations follow the tables

 the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 101 billion  as of december 31 2013  the company has a 49  interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50  joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys consolidated financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

 thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies  revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap 

management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum and the related computation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield 

  

on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 

cip revenue 



 acquisitiondisposition related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses costs related to legal settlements of preacquisition matters intangible asset amortization including amortization related to the writeoff of related management contract intangible assets changes in estimates of contingent earnout liabilities booked from prior acquisitions employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities related to a previous acquisition amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and all related tax effects 

while finitelived intangible assets are amortized under us gaap there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in certain qualifying situations these can be amortized for tax purposes generally over a 15year period as is the case in the us these cash flows in the form of reduced taxes payable represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business the company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under us gaap is not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations 

in addition the results of the discontinued operations of atlantic trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted eps accordingly the companys nongaap financial measures reflect only the continuing business of invesco management believes this presentation assists in evaluating the ongoing business performance and aids comparability with peer companies that may not have similar discontinued operations 

transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal regulatory advisory valuation integrationrelated employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees general and administrative costs including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction and the postclosing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings additionally transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closedend funds included in a prior acquisition see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18   “commitments and contingencies” for additional information related to this matter 

  

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges tax cash flow benefits and other acquisitiondisposition related adjustments as noted above in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related charges 

see table below for a reconciliation of acquisitiondisposition related items 



 certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically the funds managed by the employee invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment appreciation depreciation is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

  

 each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from us gaap to arrive at the companys nongaap financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from us gaap in a prior period

balance sheet discussion 

a summary of the balance sheet impact of cip is presented below the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on accounts receivable and investments for the year ended december 31 2013  were reductions of 34 million  and 553 million  respectively this indicates that the consolidation of cip reduced accounts receivable and investments by these amounts reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the underlying net interests in cip held by the company 

the majority of the company’s cip are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability as demonstrated by the balance sheet data that follows in this section and in the liquidity and capital resources section inclusion of the longterm debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures such as debttoequity measures causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

• reinvestment in the business 

• moderate annual growth of dividends as further discussed in the dividends section below 

• share repurchase and 

• establishment of an approximate 1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating as of the date of this report invesco held credit ratings of apositive and a3stable from standard  poors ratings services sp and moodys respectively furthermore sp considers our risk management to be strong sp rates companies enterprise risk 

  

management capabilities on a scale of fair adequate strong and excellent our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities a subgroup of invesco subsidiaries including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable european union eu directives and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences at december 31 2013  the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 6323 million   december 31 2012  5283 million  we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements as of december 31 2013  the companys minimum regulatory capital requirement was 282 million  the total amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents was 7405 million  at december 31 2013   december 31 2012  6629 million  

in addition the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its uit broker dealer entity at december 31 2013  these cash deposits totaled 113 million   december 31 2012  113 million  

the consolidation of 48 billion  and 43 billion  of total assets and longterm debt of certain clo products as of december 31 2013  respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets likewise if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details

cash flows discussion 

the ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and ongoing operating expenses is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

cash flows of cip discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” are reflected in invescos cash provided by or used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities cash held by cip is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its cip accordingly the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from cip the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of cip for example the impact of cip on net income for the year ended december 31 2013  was an addition  of 360 million  this indicates that the consolidation of cip increased consolidated net income by 360 million  also as illustrated in the table below the sum of the operating investing and financing cash flows of cip offsets to a zero impact to the companys change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted the discussion that follows the table focuses on the company’s cash flows 

  

summary of cash flow statement impact of cip 

  

operating activities 

operating cash flows include the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities although some receipts and payments are seasonal particularly bonus payments in general after allowing for the change in cash held by cip our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income 

during 2013  cash provided by  operating activities decreased   391 million  to 7802 million  from 8193 million  in 2012  as shown in the tables above the impact of cip to cash used in  operating activities was 2841 million  of cash used  during 2013  compared to 528 million  of cash used  during 2012  excluding the impact of cip cash generated by operations was 10643 million  in 2013  compared to 8721 million  in 2012  an increase of 1922 million  

the 1922 million   increase  in cash provided by  operations in 2013  when compared to 2012  is attributable to a higher net income from continuing operations the increase has been partially offset by the lower realization in 2013 of receivable balances into cash when compared to 2012 this includes the realization into cash in 2012 of a 450 million litigation related receivable recorded in the december 31 2011 balance sheet 

during the year ended december 31 2012  cash provided by operations excluding the impact of cip increased by 693 million  when compared to 2011 cash provided by operations in 2012 benefited from the realization of receivable balances into cash that were above the level experienced in 2011

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the executive overview of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

   

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 15886 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 18  “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments and support agreements 

  

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2013  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation 

we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets net of any associated valuation allowance have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

goodwill 

our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2013  and 2012  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 68673 million  and 70482 million  at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

the october 1 2013 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2012 annual impairment test with assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant changes in assumptions from 2012 related to a decrease in the equity risk premium and an increase in the risk free rate 30year treasury rate which resulted in a discount rate of 136 for the october 1 2013 analysis 2012 144 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

  

intangible assets 

where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense from continuing operations which was 154 million  255 million  and 355 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2013  and 2012  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

investments 

most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values of our 8397 million  in total investments at december 31 2013  those most susceptible to impairment include 2338 million  of seed money investments in our affiliated funds seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one three and fiveyear historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets we also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines 

  

in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

cip 

assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are vies 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns for investment products other than clos involves estimation and probability assumptions for clos there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the clos economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2013  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 42777 million   december 31 2012  39839 million  and voe fund investments of 5122 million   december 31 2012  6079 million as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip however changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests 

contingencies 

contingencies arise when we have a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business 

recent accounting standards 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies  accounting pronouncements recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of its business the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of aum market price risk securities market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 

aum market price risk 

the companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of aum declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities commodities and derivatives or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

 72 

  

 

underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors 

assuming the revenue yield on aum for the year remains unchanged a 10 decline in the average aum for the year would result in a corresponding decline in revenue certain expenses including distribution and compensation expenses may not vary in proportion with the changes in the market value of aum as such the impact on operating margin or net income of a decline in the market values of aum may be greater or less than the percentage decline in the market value of aum 

securities market risk 

the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes investments are generally made to establish a track record for a new fund or investment vehicle or to hedge economically exposure to certain deferred compensation plans the companys exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments the following table summarizes the impact of a 10 increase or decrease in the fair values of these investments 



 73 

  

 cash balances invested in money market funds of 4478 million  have been excluded from the table above these are valued under the market approach at the net asset value of the underlying funds which is maintained at 1 assets held for policyholders of 14160 million  have also been excluded from the table above the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability to the policyholders which is linked to the value of the investments the investments and the policyholder payables held by this business are carried in the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with asc topic 944 “financial services  insurance” changes in fair value are recorded and offset to zero in the consolidated statements of income in other operating revenues increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments will therefore have no impact to our pretax earnings 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments on december 31 2013  the interest rates on 1000  of the companys borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 146  years borrowings under the credit facility will have floating interest rates the interest rate profile of the financial assets of the company on december 31 2013  was 



 

 

the interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on december 31  was 



see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8  “debt” for additional disclosures relating to the us dollar floating and fixed rate obligations 

the companys only fixed interest financial assets at december 31 2013  are foreign time deposit investments of 288 million   2012  313 million  the weighted average interest rate on these investments is 068   2012  077  and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 02 years  2012  02  years 

foreign exchange rate risk

strategy 

the company focuses on four key strategic priorities that are designed to strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

 

since 2005 when we adopted our strategy to become an integrated asset manager invesco has taken a number of steps to unify our business and present the organization as a single firm to our clients around the world we believe these changes have strengthened invescos ability to operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization 

since 2008 we have encountered business challenges as we have executed our longterm strategy over the last five years investors in global markets have focused their demand on less risky asset classes such as fixed income and passive products this has in turn driven down the net revenue yield on invescos net flows as investors have shifted away from higher yielding aum such as traditional equities furthermore during this time frame much of our existing product lineup was based on locally or regionally focused investment capabilities which by their nature do not experience the same levels of operating leverage as products or capabilities that can generate global demand despite this period of challenge we were able to deliver improving investment performance and we increased our ability to grow organically we have also enhanced our financial strength have closely managed costs and shareholder returns and have delivered new products that will allow us to add global scale 

one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is nurturing a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to develop 

  

wellperforming investment capabilities within our local and global markets the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm as an example real estate securities and reits managed in dallas were first introduced to the us institutional and retail markets in 1988 a few years later we saw demand for this highly marketable capability in japan and australia and made it available to investors through mutual funds in those markets we introduced our reit capability to the european offshore market in august 2005 and to the canadian retail market in 2007 more recently we leveraged this capability in an actively managed real estate exchangetraded fund etf delivered in the us  the first of its kind weve also had success expanding our industryleading balanced risk allocation capability globally while this capability was initially created for institutional clients in the us market invesco quickly expanded to the retail market with mutual funds in the us and offshore in 2012 invesco announced that it was further expanding its multiasset capability with the addition of a dedicated multiasset team in the uk 

we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

recent developments 

throughout 2012 we continued to execute our longterm strategy which further improved our ability to serve clients reinforced our reputation as a premier global investment manager and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and continued to invest in our products and capabilities our brand our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for longterm success 

invescos continued progress against a multiyear strategy set a firm foundation for the companys many achievements throughout the year 

 

together these efforts resulted in strong positive net flows for our business in 2012  

 

 

certain demographic and industry trends 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

 5 

  

 

invesco is well positioned to capture the opportunities created by global demographic and industry trends our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue building our business and strengthening our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and ensure our longterm success 

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail institutional and high net worth investors we have a significant presence in the institutional and retail segments of the investment management industry in north america europe and asiapacific serving clients in more than 100  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment centers and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management provide us with a competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market fixed income balanced equity and alternatives approximately 43  of our aum as of december 31 2012  were invested in equity securities  december 31 2011  43  and 57  in fixed income and other investments  december 31 2011  57  in fixed income and other investments 

  

the following table sets forth the investment objectives sorted by asset class which we manage

the uk us and canadian retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2012  invesco perpetual was one of the largest retail fund providers in the uk invescos us retail business was among the top 10 largest nonproprietary fund complexes in the us by longterm assets including the invesco powershares franchise and invesco canada was among the top 10 largest retail fund managers in canada by longterm assets invesco great wall our joint venture in china was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 64 billion  as of december 31 2012  we provide our retail clients with one of the industrys most robust and comprehensive product lines 

institutional 

we provide investment solutions to institutional investors globally with a major presence in the us uk continental europe and asia with 2420 billion  in aum as of december 31 2012  we offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies including traditional equities structured equities fixed income including money market funds for institutional clients real estate private equity distressed equities financial structures and absolute return strategies regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world we have a diversified client base that includes major public entities corporations unions nonprofit organizations endowments foundations pension funds and financial institutions invescos institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the world

employees 

as of december 31 2012  we had 6128  employees across the globe as of december 31  2011  and 2010  we had 6162  and 5617 employees respectively none of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements the 2011  increase in headcount as compared to 2010  was primarily driven by the insourcing of our hyderabad india facility 

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment styles product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both distribute andor serve investment products and manage investment products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategy will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional and private wealth management clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity and may continue to do so 

in recent years capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility in this regard 

 10 

  

if the nav of one of our money market funds were to decline below 100 per share such funds could experience significant redemptions in aum loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm regulators in the us continue to evaluate whether to propose mandating a variable “floating” nav for money market funds the company believes such a change would have significant adverse consequences on the money market funds industry and the shortterm credit markets 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum aum may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease aum and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated approximately 43  of our total aum were invested in equity securities and approximately 57  were invested in fixed income and other investments at december 31 2012  our aum as of january 31 2013  were 7126 billion we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional or individual accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts we have seen our net revenue yield decline in recent years reflecting in part a shift by clients to lower fee products our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

declines in the value of seed capital and partnership investments the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and partnership investments as of december 31 2012  the company had 2756 million  in seed capital and partnership investments 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the board of trustees or 

  

directors of certain other fund accounts of invesco or our subsidiaries generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum and individual clients may elect to close their accounts redeem their shares in our funds or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its nav although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally at december 31 2012  we have 325 million invested in invesco mortgage capital inc 424 million  of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products and 444 million  invested in fixed income seed money  the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict our business activities conduct examinations risk assessments investigations and capital adequacy reviews and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies subsidiaries operating in the european union “eu” also are subject to various eu directives which are implemented by member state national legislation as a result of regulatory oversight we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business impose additional capital requirements and involve enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in private litigation against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital and such capital requirements may be increased from timetotime these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities a subgroup of invesco subsidiaries including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2012  the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 5283 million   december 31 2011  4400 million  much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company invesco ltd 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years various changes in law and regulation have been enacted or adopted and are being implemented or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators regulators and other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on invescos business while many of these provisions appear designed to address perceived problems in the banking sector certain of the provisions will or may be applied to other financial services companies including investment managers we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are 

  

adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law on july 21 2010 while invesco does not believe that the doddfrank act will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy certain provisions will and other provisions may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also will or may increase regulatory burdens and related compliance costs furthermore certain provisions may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets in addition the scope and impact of many provisions of the doddfrank act will be determined by implementing regulations some of which require lengthy proposal and promulgation periods moreover the doddfrank act mandates many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation as a result of these uncertainties regarding implementation of the doddfrank act and such other future potential legislative or regulatory changes the full impact of the doddfrank act on the investment management industry and invesco cannot be predicted at this time 

the european union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but it does appear certain provisions will and other provisions may require us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business they also will or may increase regulatory burdens and compliance costs furthermore certain provisions may have unintended adverse consequences on the liquidity or structure of the financial markets similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business such developments could have similar effects 

developments under enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes and related matters will or may include without limitation 

 13 

  

 invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on its business it is possible such changes could impose new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invescos results of operations financial condition or liquidity similarly regulatory enforcement actions which impose significant penalties or compliance obligations or which result in significant reputational harm could have similar material adverse effects on invesco moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate aum and results of operations might be adversely affected 

civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions these actions can arise from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19  commitments and contingencies” for additional information judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation increase our costs of doing business andor negatively impact our revenues any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of key individuals or significant investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products 

  

to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries investigations or findings of wrongdoing material errors in public reports employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed further our business requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client or those of invesco the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 

we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks but this task can be complex and difficult and if our procedures and controls fail our reputation could be damaged any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or contractual requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and profitability to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

  

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3stable and astable from moodys and standard  poors credit rating agencies respectively as of the date hereof we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our longterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues continued volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2012  we had outstanding total debt of 11860 million  excluding longterm debt of consolidated investment products and total equity attributable to common shareholders of 81880 million  excluding retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell a significant portion of our investment products through a variety of financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and financial organizations in europe and asia increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these trends continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other unconflicted third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients 

  

needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if one of our major distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success in recent periods illiquid markets for certain types of securities have required increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty service providers these systems or service providers could suffer deficiencies failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to regularly assess and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our aum is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we generally do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

  

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 70482 million  and 12877 million  respectively at december 31 2012   december 31 2011  69079 million  and 13228 million  respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of our goodwill impairment analysis process 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

our byelaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental   authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect   our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

  

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2012 global equity markets produced strong positive returns as evidenced by the returns of the sp 500 index which was up over 13 the nikkei 225 index which increased almost 23 in the year and the msci emerging market index which gained over 15 in 2012 the markets recovered from the significant volatility and negative sentiment experienced during 2011 as fears over the solvency of peripheral european sovereigns and the fiscal situation in the us subsided 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciation of several major market indices for 2012  2011  and 2010  



throughout 2012 invesco continued to deliver strong longterm investment performance maintained its focus on its clients and enhanced its profile in the industry 

as a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our bestinclass risk management approach a key factor in invescos ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management 

invescos enterprise risk management erm approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business risk 

 

our global performance measurement and risk group provides senior management and the board with insight into core investment risks while our corporate risk management committee facilitates a focus on strategic operational and other key business risks further business component functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business a key value of a robust enterprise risk management process is facilitating the flow of information and insight across the organization and applying that information to more effectively managing risk through this regular and consistent risk communication the board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a riskaware culture in which effective risk management is sewn into the fabric of the business as a result of our efforts in this area sp has designated our enterprise risk management rating as strong 

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification enables invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

  

  

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies” and note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

the majority of the companys consolidated investment product balances are clorelated the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys minimal direct investments in and management and performance fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets additionally the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

  

the impact of consolidation of investment products is so significant to the presentation of the company’s financial statements but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its nongaap disclosures the following discussion therefore combines the results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation there are four distinct sections within this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations after the assets under management discussion 

 

each of the financial statement summary sections results of operations balance sheet discussion and liquidity and capital resources begins with a table illustrating the impact of the consolidation of investment products relative to the companys consolidated totals the impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollarvalue change in the consolidated figures as caused by the consolidation of investment products for example the impact of consolidated investment products on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  was  410 million  this indicates that the consolidation of investment products reduced consolidated revenues by this amount reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products 

the narrative that follows each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company before consolidation of investment products as well as of the financial statement activity of consolidated investment products additionally wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented 

  

summary operating information 

summary operating information for 2012  2011  and 2010  is presented in the table below 



 

 

 

  

investment capabilities performance overview 

invescos first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients longterm performance in our equities capabilities as measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance within our equity asset class uk and global ex us and emerging markets have had strong relative performance with 87 or more of assets beating their peer group and benchmark over three and fiveyear periods us value funds reflect strong performance with 99 and 94 respectively of assets beating benchmarks and peers on a fiveyear basis within our fixed income asset class stable value products have achieved excellent longterm performance with 100 of aum ahead of benchmarks and peers on a one three and fiveyear basis 



   

  

assets under management 

the companys rolling presentation of aum from period to period on the following pages illustrates longterm inflows and outflows separately from the net flows into institutional money market funds longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

the discussion below includes presentation of aum as passive and active passive aum includes etfs uits nonfee earning leverage foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates active aum is total aum less passive aum 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences fiduciaries making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of advised clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2012  were 6877 billion   december 31 2011  6253 billion  december 31 2010  6165 billion  during the year ended december 31 2012  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 124 billion  while positive  market movements increased  aum by 488 billion  we experienced net inflows  in institutional money market funds of 01 billion  increases  in aum of 28 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates and net outflows from dispositions of  17 billion  during the year ended december 31 2012  during the year ended december 31 2011  net inflows   increased  aum by 192 billion  and negative  market movements decreased aum by 153 billion we experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of 53 billion offset by decreases in aum of 04 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2011  during the year ended december 31 2010  net inflows increased aum by 55 billion and positive market movements increased aum by 439 billion we experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of 155 billion and increases in aum of 16 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2010  acquisitions added 1215 billion of aum in 2010 including 1146 billion of aum added at june 1 2010 with the acquisition of morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” average aum during the year ended december 31 2012  were 6644 billion  compared to 6343 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  and 5323 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2012  included net longterm inflows  of passive aum of 111 billion  and active net longterm inflows  of 13 billion  net flows were driven by net inflows into both our retail and institutional distribution channels of 104 billion  and 03 billion  respectively primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of 93 billion net inflows during the year ended december 31 2011  included net longterm inflows of passive aum of 175 billion and active net longterm aum inflows of 17 billion net flows in 2011 were driven by positive net inflows of 91 billion into our retail and 89 billion into institutional distribution channels primarily in the fixed asset class while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of 79 billion 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying investments from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis global equity markets produced strong returns during the year ended december 31 2012  contrasting with overall declines experienced in the year ending december 31 2011 of the  488 billion   increase  in aum resulting from market gains during the year ended december 31 2012  333 billion  of this increase  was due to the change in value of our equity asset class our fixed income balanced and alternatives asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period of the total decrease in aum resulting from market losses during the year ended december 31 2011  148 billion was due to the change in value of our equity asset class decreasing in line with equity markets globally of the 439 billion increase in aum resulting from market increases during the year ended december 31 2010  334 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class in line with increases in the sp 500 and the ftse 100 indices of 128 and 90 respectively during that period 

foreign exchange rate movements in our aum result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as nonus dollar denominated aum is translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2012  was driven primarily by the strengthening  of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased aum into us dollars the strengthening  of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our canadian dollarbased aum into us dollars and the strengthening  of the euro relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation 

  

of our eurobased aum into us dollars this was partly offset by the weakening  of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our yenbased aum into us dollars the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2011  was driven primarily by the strengthening  of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar partially offset by the weakening  of the pound sterling canadian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2010  was driven by the strengthening  of the canadian dollar and japanese yen relative to the us dollar offset by the weakening  of the pound sterling and the euro 

the table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates for translation into the us dollar the reporting currency of the company at december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  



net revenue yield on aum decreased 12 basis points to 445 basis points in the year ended december 31 2012  from the year ended december 31 2011  level of 457 basis points excluding performance fees the net revenue yield decreased 15 basis points to 436 basis points in the year ended december 31 2012  from the year ended december 31 2011  level of 451 basis points changes in our aum mix significantly impact our net revenue yield for example on an asset class basis our equity aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market aum the tables that follow also analyze aum into active and passive style passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2012  passive aum were 1140 billion  representing 166  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2011  passive aum were 963 billion representing 154 of our total aum at that date in the year ended december 31 2012  the net revenue yield on passive aum was 93 basis points compared to 108 basis points in the year ended december 31 2011  a reduction of 15 basis points the net revenue yield before performance fees on active aum has been more stable reducing from 508 basis points in the year ended december 31 2011  to 504 basis points in the year ended december 31 2012  the higher proportion of passive aum combined with the lower yield earned by passive aum resulted in the majority of the overall yield reduction experienced in 2012 when compared to 2011 the increase in passive aum includes the movements in the powershares qqq nasdaq100 index tracking fund the powershares qqq fund aum increased to 304 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 256 billion at december 31 2011 an increase in passive aum of 48 billion the revenue yield for invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point reimbursing invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund and flows into and out of this product therefore have a significant impact on the overall net revenue yield and are a significant factor in the yearonyear yield reduction 

although net revenue yield reduced on a yearonyear basis this trend reversed during the second half of 2012 due to improving equity markets as well as net inflows in the balanced asset class including strong net aum flows in our continental european business the balanced asset class includes the invesco balanced risk allocation strategy range of products aum for this strategy reached 187 billion as at december 31 2012 compared to 52 billion at december 31 2011 an increase of 135 billion during the year these active aum inflows assisted in stabilizing the active and passive aum mix and contributed to a net revenue yield before performance fees of 444 basis points in the final quarter of 2012 compared to the 436 basis points recorded for the year ended december 31 2012  

gross revenue yield on aum decreased 17 basis points to 632 basis points in the year ended december 31 2012  from the year ended december 31 2011  level of 649 basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the companys true effective fee rate from aum see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



a significant portion of our business and aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by 208 million  equivalent to 05  of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2012  when compared to the year ended december 31 2011  749 million increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 or 18 of 2011 total operating revenues additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from most global capital markets increased in the year ended december 31 2012  these market value increases combined with net new business inflows contributed to a net increase in aum of  624 billion  during the year

management fees by approximately 30 million commencing june 1 2011 these fee waivers began to cease during mid2012 

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees increased  by 984 million   31  in the year ended december 31 2012  to 32369 million  year ended december 31 2011  31385 million  this compares to a 47 increase in average aum and a 52 increase in average longterm aum as discussed above the net revenue yield is lower in the year ended december 31 2012  when compared to the year ended december 31 2011  due to changes in the composition of our aum the weighting of aum flows into passive products has lowered the overall aum net revenue yield in addition as mentioned above management fees were reduced commencing in june 2011 due to acquisition integrationrelated us mutual fund mergers some of these fee waiver agreements lapsed in mid2012 benefiting revenue in the second half of 2012 see the companys disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the year ended december 31 2012  in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by 179 million  182 of the increase during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  

investment management fees increased by 4176 million 153 in the year ended december 31 2011 to 31385 million year ended december 31 2010 27209 million the increase compares to a 192 increase in average aum and a 221 increase in average longterm aum as discussed above in the “assets under management” section the mix of our aum asset classes changed partly due to the aum acquired through acquisitions and partly due to market value changes and investor flows such that the revenue yield on our average aum was lower in 2011 when compared to 2010 the percentage increase in investment management fees is therefore lower than the percentage increase in average aum and average longterm aum the lower yield also reflects the acquisitionrelated us mutual fund fee waivers that commenced in june 2011 foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 672 million 161 of the increase in investment management fees during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in the year ended december 31 2012  service and distribution fees decreased  by 87 million   11  to 7716 million  year ended december 31 2011  7803 million  due primarily to decreases in transfer agency fees of 49 million and administration and custodial fees of 23 million the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by 15 million during the year ended december 31 2012  the fee reductions are attributable to the fund mergers and fee waivers associated with the us mutual fund product realignment the continued conversion of bshare fee structures to class ashares that generate a lower annual service fee and other changes in the aum mix as a larger percentage of aum charges no or lower distribution fees during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  

in the year ended december 31 2011 service and distribution fees increased by 1348 million 209 to 7803 million year ended december 31 2010 6455 million primarily due to the acquisition and due to the increase in average aum during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

  

performance fees 

performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with method 1 of asc topic 60520s99 “revenue recognition  services  sec materials” cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect we have performance fee arrangements that include monthly quarterly and annual measurement dates given the uniqueness of each transaction performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies if performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance of our 6877 billion  in aum at december 31 2012  approximately 473 billion  or 69  could potentially earn performance fees 

in the year ended december 31 2012  performance fees increased  by 209 million   551  to 588 million  year ended december 31 2011  379 million  the performance fees generated in 2012  arose primarily due to products managed by atlantic trust 174 million the bank loan group 165 million invesco perpetual 127 million and the european real estate group 79 million

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased by 2287 million 217 in the year ended december 31 2011 to 12825 million year ended december 31 2010 10538 million which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues reflecting the impact of the acquired business foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 247 million 108 of the increase in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the companys most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49  investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments decreased  by 39 million   94  to 375 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  year ended december 31 2011  414 million  the decrease moved in line with our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2012  which was 30 billion  compared to 33 billion  at the year ended december 31 2011  

the 19 decrease in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments to 414 million in 2011 year ended december 31 2010 422 million was driven by the decline in average aum of the invesco great wall joint venture our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2011 was 33 billion a 83 decline in average aum from 36 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 

management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net 

  

revenues 

management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products decreased  by 63 million  to 410 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  year ended december 31 2011  473 million  the decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended december 31 2012

general and administrative expenses increased by 332 million 127 to 2954 million in the year ended december 31 2011 year ended december 31 2010 2622 million increases in general and administrative expenses include the impact of the acquisition professional services expenses increased 83 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 due to increases in consultant fees of 92 million contractor and recruitment fees of 56 million information services of 45 million legal fees of 31 million including legal fees associated with settlement litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor of 36 million and other professional services of 12 million travel expenses increased 111 million driven by higher levels of business activity and mutual fund expenses increased 70 million during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 expenditure related tax increases including uk value added tax vat resulted in an additional 45 million of irrecoverable vat expense during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 as vat rates increased in the uk these increases are offset by reduced regulatory fees of 133 million relating to a levy from the uk financial services compensation scheme in 2010 of 153 million to cover claims resulting from failures of nonaffiliated investment firms professional insurance costs of 10 million accounting services of 06 million and directors fees and expenses of 04 million included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 was 89 million representing fund reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations other net decreases of 21 million in general and administrative expenses consist of a reduction in acquisitionrelated contingent consideration payable gains on disposal of property plant and equipment and fund reimbursement costs on trade corrections offset by an increase in intangible amortization expense due to the acquisitions and that includes a write down of certain management contract intangibles the impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 36 million 108 of the increase in general and administrative costs during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

transaction and integration 

transaction and integration expenses include acquisitionrelated charges incurred during the periods to effect a business combination including legal regulatory advisory valuation integrationrelated employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees general and administrative costs including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction and postclosing costs of integrating the acquired business into the companys existing operations additionally transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the preacquisition period with respect to various closedend funds included in the acquisition see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19  “commitments and contingencies” for additional information

other income and expenses 

the main categories of other income and expenses and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows 



equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased  by 08 million   26  to 297 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  year ended december 31 2011  305 million  the decrease  in equity in earnings is driven by the declines in our pretax earnings of our joint venture investments in china of 34 million offset by the increase of 26 million in our share of the marketdriven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments which includes our investment in invesco mortgage capital inc 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 97 million 241 to 305 million in the year ended december 31 2011 year ended december 31 2010 402 million included in equity in earnings from affiliates is our share of the income from our joint ventures in china which declined by 24 million to 215 million in the year ended december 31 2011 from 239 million earned during the year ended december 31 2010 declines in equity in earnings from our joint ventures are due to declines in revenues that are in turn attributable to lower average aum in those entities during the year earnings from our affiliate in poland increased by 02 million to 13 million in year ended december 31 2011 from 11 million earned in the year ended december 31 2010 the remainder of the variance is due to our share of the marketdriven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments which decreased by 74 million to 77 million earned in the year ended december 31 2011 from 151 million earned during the year ended december 31 2010 

  

interest and dividend income and interest expense 

interest and dividend income decreased  by 12 million   109  to 98 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  year ended december 31 2011  110 million  the decrease  in interest and dividend income is largely due to a decrease in investment income and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents of 11 million the remaining 01 million decrease is due to reduction of dividend income on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans this dividend income is passed through to employee participants in the deferred compensation plans 

interest expense decreased  by 95 million   154  to 523 million  in the year ended december 31 2012  year ended december 31 2011  618 million  primarily due to the retirement of the 2151 million 5625 senior notes in april 2012 lower borrowing costs versus the comparative period also contributed to lower interest for the period 

  

interest and dividend income increased by 06 million 58 to 110 million in the year ended december 31 2011 year ended december 31 2010 104 million the year ended december 31 2011 includes dividend income of 49 million on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans december 31 2010 27 million the increase in dividend income of 22 million is offset by the decreases in investment income and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents of 16 million resulting from lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during the year ended december 31 2011 

interest expense increased by 32 million 55 to 618 million in the year ended december 31 2011 year ended december 31 2010 586 million higher average debt balances were partly offset by lower average cost of debt during the year ended december 31 2011

nonoperating income and expense of consolidated investment products 

interest income of consolidated investment products results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated clos which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated clos and other clo operating expense requirements including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

in the year ended december 31 2012  interest income of consolidated investment products decreased  by 487 million   159  to 2585 million  year ended december 31 2011  3072 million  primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain clo products as well as the impact of certain clos entering their amortization period interest expense of consolidated investment products 

  

decreased  by 187 million   100  to 1683 million  year ended december 31 2011  1870 million  primarily due to clo deconsolidation 

included in other gainslosses of consolidated investment products net are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of consolidated investment products in the year ended december 31 2012  other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net loss  of 977 million  as compared to a net loss  of 1389 million  in the year ended december 31 2011  the net loss  in the 2012  period is primarily associated with real estate investments and increases in the market values of the longterm debt of clos that more than offset gains in the market values of investments held by clos 

in the year ended december 31 2011 interest income of consolidated investment products increased by 663 million 275 to 3072 million year ended december 31 2010 2409 million reflecting the acquisition and higher interest rates on variable rate asset collateral held by the clos interest expense of consolidated investment products increased by 684 million 577 to 1870 million year ended december 31 2010 1186 million reflecting the acquisition and higher variable interest rates on outstanding principal balances of clo notes in 2011 

in the year ended december 31 2011 other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net loss of 1389 million as compared to a net gain of 1140 million in the year ended december 31 2010 the net loss in the 2011 period is primarily due to losses in clo investments and longterm debt which more than offset gains in the market value of investments held by consolidated private equity funds the net gain in the 2010 period is primarily due to changes in market values of investments held by consolidated private equity funds 

net impact of consolidated investment products and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

as illustrated in the summary of income statement impact of consolidated investment products table at the beginning of this results of operations section the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2012 resulted in a decrease  to net income of 1005 million  before attribution to noncontrolling interests invesco invests in only a portion of these products and as a result this net loss  is offset by noncontrolling interests of 898 million  resulting in a net decrease  in net income of the company of 107 million  

the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2011 resulted in a decrease to net income of 874 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of 1076 million resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of 202 million the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2010 resulted in an increase to net income of 1807 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests this net income is offset by noncontrolling interests of 1709 million resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of 98 million 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in consolidated investment products movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the companys consolidated statements of income generally offset the gains and losses interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products 

additionally consolidated investment products represent less than 1 of the companys aum therefore the net gains or losses of consolidated investment products is not indicative of the performance of the companys aggregate assets under management 

income before taxes 

total income before taxes includes income before taxes of consolidated investment products consolidated investment products are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level therefore there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of consolidated investment products accordingly the table included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 16 taxation illustrating the division of incomelosses before taxes between us and foreign is formatted such that the income before taxes of consolidated investment products is separately stated the commentary below discusses disparities between us and foreign income before taxes in the taxation footnote and us and foreign operating revenues in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18 geographic information 

total us income before taxes of 5452 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 includes income before taxes of consolidated investment products of 597 million  which primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships us income before taxes from consolidated investment products decreased   333 million   358  from 2011 due primarily to lower gains generated by these private equity partnerships excluding consolidated investment products us income before taxes in 2012 decreased   09 million   02  income before taxes in 2012 had a small decrease contrary to the 49   increase  in us operating revenues due primarily to a legal settlement gain recognized in 2011 as discussed above 

  

 total foreign income before taxes of 3143 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 includes losses  before taxes of consolidated investment products of 1602 million  which primarily consists of losses from consolidated clos and japanese real estate partnerships foreign consolidated investment product pretax losses totaled 1602 million  in 2012 compared to pretax losses of 1804 million  in 2011 primarily due to lower losses on investments held by the companys consolidated clos in 2012 excluding consolidated investment products foreign income before taxes decreased  by 346 million   68  foreign income in 2012 decreased  more significantly than the 08   decrease  in foreign operating revenues due to increased foreign expenses incurred in 2012 such as the 153 million additional distribution fee recorded in the uk as discussed above and expenses incurred in connection with the outsourcing of the european transfer agency 

total us income before taxes of 5794 million  for the year ended december 31 2011 december 31 2010 2710 million  includes income before taxes of consolidated investment products of 930 million  december 31 2010 972 million  the 180   increase  in us income before taxes excluding consolidated investment products is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of the acquisition of morgan stanleys retail asset management business which occurred on june 1 2010 income before taxes increased in 2011 more significantly than the increase in operating revenues from the yearended december 31 2010 due to the 1500 million  of transaction and integration costs that lowered income before taxes in 2010 us income before taxes of consolidated investment products primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships and totaled 930 million  for the year ended december 31 2011 a decrease  of 42 million   4  from 2010 

total foreign income before taxes of 3287 million  for the year ended december 31 2011 december 31 2010 5628 million  includes losses  before taxes of consolidated investment products of 1804 million  december 31 2010 income before taxes of consolidated investment products of 835 million  the 62   increase  in foreign income before taxes excluding consolidated investment products is driven by a 119   increase  in foreign operating revenues during the period foreign incomelosses before taxes of consolidated investment products primarily consists of incomelosses from consolidated collateralized loan obligations clos and japanese real estate partnerships the change in foreign losses before taxes from consolidated investment products is primarily due to marketdriven losses incurred by the companys consolidated clos in 2011 whereas gains were recorded by the consolidated clos in 2010 clo losses in 2011 were primarily driven by losses on longterm debt issued by the clos and losses on asset collateral held by the clos losses on longterm debt were primarily due to narrower spread valuation assumptions on debt issued by certain clos and lower default rates clo pretax income in 2010 was primarily driven by strong interest income on variable rate asset collateral held by the clos 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 increased to 317 year ended december 31 2011 315 due a smaller impact from losses in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities in 2012 versus 2011 the inclusion of noncontrolling interests increased our effective tax rate by 30 in 2012 and 33 in 2011 the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income the 2011 rate reflects a favorable impact from the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions as a result of the statute of limitation closing 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 increased to 315 year ended december 31 2010236 due to losses in noncontrolling interests in 2011 versus income in 2010 the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate by 33 in 2011 and decreased it by 61 in 2010 the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pretax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed partially offset by a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2011 versus 2010 the 2010 rate also included nondeductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  accounting policies revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum and the related computation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

 

the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 64 billion  as of december 31 2012  the company has a 490 interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50 joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

 

see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20   “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of investment products the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and net income for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted net income the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the operating and nonoperating income and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

  

 

acquisitionrelated adjustments include transaction and integration expenses and intangible asset amortization related to acquired assets amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co and tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal regulatory advisory valuation integrationrelated employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees general and administrative costs including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction and the post closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the preacquisition period with respect to various closedend funds included in the acquisition see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19   “commitments and contingencies” for additional information additionally acquisitionrelated reconciling items include changes in estimates of contingent earnout liabilities booked from prior acquisitions which is offset in the period by increased amortization related to the writeoff of related management contract intangible assets the us gaap to nongaap reconciling items also include acquisitionrelated amortization charges related to previous business combinations the tax benefit is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges and the amortization expenses in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisitionrelated charges 

while finitelived intangible assets are amortized under us gaap there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in certain qualifying situations these can be amortized for tax purposes generally over a 15year period as is the case in the us these cash flows in the form of reduced taxes payable represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business we believe it is useful to include these tax cash flow benefits in arriving at the adjusted diluted eps measure the company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under us gaap is not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations 

 

certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically the funds managed by the employee invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment appreciation depreciation is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted diluted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

  

 

as part of the outsourcing of the uk transfer agency as discussed below in footnote 8 other reconciling items operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense of 153 million 116 million net of tax in the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2012 this additional expense is attributable to periods prior to 2012 for the reasons outlined below this expense has been excluded in arriving at our nongaap results

liquidity and capital resources 

our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements we have reduced our leverage at december 31 2012  from a year ago as illustrated by the change in our debttoequity ratios in the table below material changes in the companys capital structure over the last three years include

our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include 

• reinvestment in the business 

• steady annual growth of dividends as illustrated and further discussed in the dividends section below 

• share repurchase and 

• establishment of an approximate 1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements 

these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong investmentgrade credit rating 

as of the date of this report invesco holds credit ratings of astable and a3stable from sp and moodys respectively furthermore sp considers our risk management to be strong standard  poors rates companies enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of fair adequate strong and excellent our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit ratings the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted see also part i item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

the consolidation of 42 billion  and 40 billion  of total assets and longterm debt of certain clo products as of december 31 2012  respectively did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets conversely if the clos were to liquidate their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 20  “consolidated investment products” for additional details

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the executive overview of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions however we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

   

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

  

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 11860 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1  “accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation we operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

goodwill  our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2012  and 2011  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 70482 million  and 69079 million  at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys aum or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees 

  

the october 1 2012 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2011 annual impairment test with assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant change in assumptions from 2011 related to a decrease in the market risk premium which resulted in a discount rate of 144 for the october 1 2012 analysis 2011 160 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates a 45 decline in fair value or more than a 650 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our october 1 2012 goodwill impairment analysis would be required to cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value thus triggering step two of the goodwill impairment test the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets  where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 296 million  422 million  and 303 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2012  and 2011  annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

investments most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values of our 6107 million  in total investments at december 31 2012  those most susceptible to impairment include 1134 million  of seed money investments in our affiliated funds seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 65 

  

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one three and fiveyear historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets we also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

consolidated investment products assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are vies 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns for investment products other than clos involves estimation and probability assumptions for clos there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly effect the clos economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2012  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 39839 million   december 31 2011  57251 million  and voe fund investments of 6079 million   december 31 2011  9038 million  as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes 

contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal or national statutes as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other noncurrent liabilities as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from state or federal agencies if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business

invesco ltd is organized under the laws of bermuda and our common shares are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ivz” we maintain a web site at wwwinvescocom information contained on our web site shall not be deemed to be part of or be incorporated into this document 

strategy 

the company focuses on four key strategic priorities that are designed to strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

 

since 2005 invesco has taken a number of steps to unify our business and present the organization as a single firm to our clients around the world we believe these changes have strengthened invescos ability to operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization 

one of invescos great strengths is our separate distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe a key focus of our business is nurturing a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to develop wellperforming investment capabilities within our local and global markets 

the ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm as an example our highly regarded real estate team in dallas has produced industryleading results for clients over most of its 20 years in the business real estate securities and reits managed in dallas were first introduced to the us institutional and retail markets in 1988 a few years later we saw demand for this highly marketable capability in japan and australia and made it available to investors through mutual funds in those markets we introduced our reit capability to the european offshore market in august 2005 and to the canadian retail market in 2007 more recently we leveraged this capability in an actively managed real estate exchangetraded fund etf delivered in the us  the first of its kind 

there are many more examples where invesco has leveraged marketleading capabilities in one part of our business to meet client demand in other parts of our business this is another of invescos great strengths and it is supported by our efficient global operating platform and effective sales platform that span established and growing markets around the world its also a tremendous competitive advantage since few firms have the breadth of strategies strong investment culture and ontheground sales and service presence to match invescos our ability to understand local needs and provide solutions globally represents a significant 

  

opportunity in a worldwide market of investable funds that exceeds 54 trillion as of december 31 2011 

we take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

recent developments 

throughout 2011 we continued to execute our longterm strategy which we believe further improved our ability to serve our clients reinforced our reputation as a premier global investment manager and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins in addition we took steps to further strengthen our financial position and augment our capital flexibility through the execution of a new credit facility and the maintenance of a balanced approach to capital management currently invesco is one of only four publicly rated investment managers designated with a “strong” enterprise risk management rating from standard  poors which reflects our comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating risks outside of the firms risk tolerance levels 

invescos commitment to a multiyear strategy set a firm foundation for the companys many achievements throughout the year 

 

the 2010 acquisition of morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments enabled invesco to further strengthen our competitive position in the us the addition of this diversified business on june 1 2010 brought 1146 billion in aum across equity fixed income and alternative asset classes including mutual funds variable insurance funds separate accounts and unit investment trusts uits furthermore invesco gained the experience knowledge and expertise of nearly 600 investment distribution and operations support professionals globally the combined depth and breadth of our investment capabilities our strong investment performance and a focused client engagement effort resulted in solid momentum in our us retail business throughout 2011 

together these efforts resulted in positive net flows for our business in 2011 adjusted operating margin improved to 369  in 2011 from 356  in 2010 see part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and by calculation a reconciliation of operating margin to adjusted operating margin and important additional disclosures 

 

 

certain demographic and industry trends 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be welldiversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

 5 

  

for an array of investment solutions that span the breadth of investment capabilities with a particular emphasis on savings vehicles for retirement we believe invesco as one of the few truly global independent investment managers is very wellpositioned to attract these retirement assets through its products that are focused on longterm investment performance 

 

invesco is well positioned to capture the opportunities created by global demographic and industry trends through a variety of economic and market environments we have significantly strengthened our competitive position our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and ensure our longterm success across a variety of markets 

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global operating platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail institutional and highnetworth investors we have a significant presence in the institutional and retail segments of the investment management industry in north america europe and asiapacific serving clients in more than 100  countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment centers and their welldefined investment disciplines and risk management provide us with a competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invescos and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market fixed income balanced equity and alternatives approximately 43  of our aum as of december 31 2011  were invested in equity securities  december 31 2010  48  24  in fixed income and 33  in other investments  december 31 2010  21  in fixed income and 31  in other investments

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment styles product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both distribute andor serve investment products and manage investment products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategy will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional and private wealth management clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invescos revenues operations financial condition and liquidity and may continue to do so 

the capital and credit markets continue to experience substantial volatility in this regard

investment vehicles or to timely meet client redemption requests 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under our   management as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net   outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management assets under management may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease assets under management and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated approximately 43 of our total assets under management were invested in equity securities and approximately 57 were invested in fixed income and other investments at december 31 2011  our aum as of january 31 2012  were 6483 billion  we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our assets under management are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts   managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional or individual accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts therefore our revenues may decline if clients shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

declines in the value of seed capital and partnership investments the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and partnership investments as of december 31 2011  the company had 1941 million  in seed capital and partnership investments 

  

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our   fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each funds board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the board of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts of invesco or our subsidiaries generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under our management and individual clients may elect to close their accounts redeem their shares in our funds or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or assets under management would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be   harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its net asset value although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining net asset value some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have 255 million invested in invesco mortgage capital inc 504 million  of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products and 165 million  invested in fixed income seed money at december 31 2011  the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many   countries and any adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could   decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict business activities subsidiaries operating in the european union eu also are subject to various eu directives which are implemented by member state national legislation possible sanctions include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities a subgroup of invesco subsidiaries including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2011  the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4400 million   december 31 2010  4562 million   much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company invesco ltd we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years various changes in law and regulation have been enacted or adopted and are beginning to be implemented or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by various legislators regulators other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their 

  

implementation could have a material impact on invescos business while many of these provisions appear designed to address perceived problems in the banking sector certain of the provisions will or may be applied to other financial services companies including investment managers we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law on july 21 2010 while invesco does not at this time believe that the doddfrank act will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its fundamental strategy certain provisions will and other provisions may increase regulatory burdens and related compliance costs in addition the scope and impact of many provisions of the doddfrank act will be determined by implementing regulations some of which require lengthy proposal and promulgation periods moreover the doddfrank act mandates many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation as a result of these uncertainties regarding implementation of the doddfrank act and such other future potential legislative or regulatory changes the impact of the doddfrank act on the investment management industry and invesco cannot be predicted at this time 

the european union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but it does appear certain provisions will and other provisions may increase regulatory burdens and compliance costs similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business such developments could have similar effects 

potential developments under enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes and related matters include without limitation 

 13 

  

 

invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes on its business it is possible such changes could impose new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invescos results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and results of operations might be adversely affected 

civil litigation and governmental enforcement actions and investigations could   adversely affect our assets under management and future financial results and   increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of   our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of   those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of key individuals or significant investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net   income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries material errors in public reports employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed further our business requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client or those of invesco we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage conflicts of interest but this task can be complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

  

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations   

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or contractual requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and net income to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase   commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those   intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

as part of our business strategy we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets including for purposes of financing potential acquisitions depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3stable and astable from moodys and standard  poors credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k according to moodys obligations rated a are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk invescos rating of a3 is at the low end of the a range a1 a2 a3 but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of baa3 standard and poors rating of a is at the lower end of the a rating with bbb representing standard and poors lowest investment grade rating according to standard and poors a obligations exhibit a strong capacity to meet financial commitments but are somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility negative tangible equity and potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings 

  

thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our long or shortterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues continued volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2011  we had outstanding total debt of 12847 million  and total equity attributable to common shareholders of 77848 million  excluding retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if   amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets   to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and   hinder our growth 

we sell a significant portion of our investment products through a variety of financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and financial organizations in europe and asia increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these trends continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other unconflicted third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if one of our major distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the 

  

breach 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service   functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims   against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success in recent periods illiquid markets for certain types of securities have required increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty vendors these systems or vendors could suffer deficiencies failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity   problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory   actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to regularly assess and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and   have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates   to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the   next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our assets under management is presently denominated in us dollars however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews we also have definitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified goodwill and intangible assets totaled 69079 million  and 13228 million  respectively at december 31 2011   december 31 2010  69802 million  and 13372 million  respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies  goodwill” and “ intangibles” for additional details of the companys goodwill impairment analysis process 

  

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less   protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda companies act the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances directors and officers may owe duties to a companys creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

our byelaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental   authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect   our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments   for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity 

  

of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and   results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

financial markets began 2011 on an upswing due to optimism that the global economy was finally recovering from the 2008 financial crisis however the optimism was replaced by volatility as a number of shocks hit the global economy negatively impacting equity markets around the world first japan suffered a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami and nuclear emergency while markets outside of japan recovered from the initial shock the nikkei 225 index declined over 17 for the year additionally continental europes sovereign debt issues worsened during 2011 resulting in deepening concern about the financial condition of greece and other countries efforts by european authorities to address the crisis repeatedly fell short of market expectations and as a result equity markets in europe suffered declines in 2011 with the ftse 100 index down almost 6 in the us concern of default on the countrys debt payments intensified in early august 2011 followed immediately thereafter by the firstever downgrade of the uss credit rating by sp to aa from aaa us equity markets as illustrated by the movement in the sp 500 were able to recover from double digit declines in the third quarter of 2011 to finish at levels consistent with the beginning of 2011 although global equity markets have staged a strong recovery after december 2008 many still remain below their 2007 highs 

the table below summarizes the year ended december 31  returns based on price appreciation of several major market indices for 2011  2010  and 2009  



despite the downgrade of the us credit rating returns on us treasury securities increased significantly in 2011  as investors concern about the solvency of european sovereigns and continued uncertainty on the economic recovery resulted in a flight to perceived safety the increased demand for treasury securities caused 10year treasury prices to soar pushing yields to record lows during the year briefly touching 170 during the third quarter for the year of 2011 the 10year treasury returned 172 

invesco made progress in a number of areas that further enhanced our competitive position as the markets continued their 

  

measured return to prefinancial crisis levels throughout 2011 the companys financial performance strengthened in addition invesco continued to deliver strong longterm investment performance maintained its focus on its clients and enhanced its profile in the industry 

as a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our bestinclass risk management approach a key factor in invescos ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management 

invescos enterprise risk management erm approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization broadly our approach includes two governance structures  one for investments and another for business risk 

 

our global performance measurement and risk group provides senior management and the board with insight into core investment risks while our corporate risk management committee facilitates a focus on strategic operational and other key business risks further business component functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business a key value of a robust enterprise risk management process is facilitating the flow of information and insight across the organization and applying that information to more effectively managing risk through this regular and consistent risk communication the board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a riskaware culture in which effective risk management is sewn into the fabric of the business as a result of our efforts in this area invesco is one of only four publicly rated asset managers designated with a “strong” enterprise risk management rating by sp 

in addition we benefited from our longterm efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management one of invescos core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world this broad diversification enables invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

  

the addition of morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments the acquired business or acquisition in 2010 and our anticipated successful integration of the business during 2011 enabled invesco to further strengthen our competitive position in the us the depth and breadth of our investment capabilities our strong investment performance and a focused client engagement effort resulted in solid momentum in our us retail business throughout 2011 

european infrastructure 

as part of the transformational initiative announced earlier this year the company is in the process of outsourcing its transfer agency function in europe which is presently operated internally this outsourcing activity is expected to be completed by december 2012 we believe that taking steps today to outsource our european transfer agency will allow the firm to better respond in the future to the pending but still uncertain regulatory environment it is too early to accurately forecast the implications of all the proposed regulations eg mifid ii in europe and the retail distribution review in the uk but it is clear that these have the potential to significantly change the relationships between distributors clients and investment managers under any likely scenario we believe outsourcing our european transfer agency will reduce both the cost and risk of operations for us and will allow us to react more swiftly to changes in the marketplace and therefore further solidify and strengthen our competitive position 

during the year ended december 31 2011  the company incurred 188 million  of costs directly related to the implementation of this initiative and will incur total implementation costs of up to 40 million by the projected completion date of december 2012 the 40 million estimate is based on the expected cost to outsource our european transfer agency and on our plans to make certain structural changes to our product and distribution platforms as regulations become more clear in the future we will be able to provide updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative to the extent that clarity of regulations affects the scope of the initiative the implementation costs associated with the european transformation will include primarily systems and data conversion surplus leased space staff severance related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 330 employees fund redomicile legal and consulting costs these costs will be included within the respective expense line items in the us gaap condensed consolidated income statement and will be excluded in arriving at nongaap earnings information this initiative is expected to generate material ongoing cost savings approximately 15 million per year that will more than fully offset the implementation expense within a three year time frame after completion 

  

presentation of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies” and note 20 “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

effective january 1 2010 the company adopted guidance now encompassed in accounting standards codification topic 810 “consolidation” the adoption of this new guidance had a significant impact on the presentation of the companys financial statements in 2011 and 2010 as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain clos that were not previously consolidated in accordance with the standard prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these clos the majority of the companys consolidated investment products balances were clorelated as of december 31 2011  and 2010 the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets additionally the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

  

the impact of consolidation of investment products is so significant to the presentation of companys financial statements but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company that combined with the presentation of newlyincurred transaction and integration costs and additional intangible asset amortization resulting from the acquired business the company expanded its use of nongaap measures beginning with the presentation of the companys results for the three months ended march 31 2010 the discussion that follows therefore combines results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with the companys nongaap presentation there are four distinct sections within this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations after the assets under management discussion 

 

the results of operations balance sheet and cash flow within the liquidity and capital resources section discussions begin with tables illustrating the impact of the consolidation of investment products the narrative that follows each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company before consolidation of investment products as well as of the financial statement activity of consolidated investment products additionally wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the companys income statements for the periods presented 

  

reclassifications 

in 2011 the company changed its presentation of marketing support expenses from marketing expenses to thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses in the consolidated statements of income such reclassifications had no impact on total operating expenses net income or equity attributable to common shareholders the impact to 2010 2009 2008 and 2007 is illustrated below 



throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation in addition all measures calculated from net revenues and operating expenses such as net revenue yield and adjusted operating margin have been recalculated based on the new presentation 

  

summary operating information 

summary operating information for 2011  2010  and 2009  is presented in the table below 



 

 

a significant portion of our business and aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from most global capital markets decreased in the year ended december 31 2011  these market value decreases were offset by net new business inflows which resulted in a net increase in aum of 88 billion during the year aum at january 31 2012  were 6483 billion  

  

investment capabilities performance overview 

invescos first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients longterm performance in our equities capabilities as measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance within our equity asset class asian european global ex us and emerging markets have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over three and fiveyear periods our us value funds have exceptional longterm performance with over 96 of assets ahead of benchmarks and peer group medians on a three and fiveyear basis uk and european equity funds reflect strong performance with 96 and 93 respectively of assets beating benchmarks and peers on a fiveyear basis within our fixed income asset class stable value products have achieved excellent longterm performance with 100 of aum ahead of benchmarks and peers on a one three and fiveyear basis 



 

  

assets under management 

the companys rolling presentation of aum from period to period on the following pages illustrates longterm inflows and outflows separately from the net flows into institutional money market funds longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change their investment preferences fiduciaries making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of advised clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investors decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

aum at december 31 2011  were 6253 billion   december 31 2010  6165 billion  december 31 2009  4595 billion  during the year ended december 31 2011  net longterm inflows   increased  aum by 192 billion  while negative  market movements decreased  aum by 153 billion  we experienced net inflows  in institutional money market funds of 53 billion  and decreases  in aum of 04 billion  due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2011  during the year ended december 31 2010  net inflows   increased  aum by 55 billion  and positive  market movements increased aum by 439 billion we experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of 155 billion and increases in aum of 16 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2010  morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” added 1146 billion in aum at june 1 2010 additionally during the year ended december 31 2010  other acquisitions added 69 billion of aum net of dispositions during the year ended december 31 2009  net inflows increased aum by 166 billion and positive market movements increased aum by 547 billion we experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of 01 billion and increases in aum of 112 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2009  average aum during the year ended december 31 2011  were 6343 billion  compared to 5323 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  and 4158 billion  for the year ended december 31 2009  

net inflows  during the year ended december 31 2011  included net longterm inflows  of etf uit and passive aum of 175 billion  and other net longterm inflows  of 17 billion  net flows were driven by net inflows into both our retail and institutional distribution channels of 91 billion  and 89 billion  respectively primarily in the fixed income asset class while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of 79 billion 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying investments from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends of the total decrease  in aum resulting from market losses during the year ended december 31 2011  148 billion  of this decrease  was due to the change in value of our equity asset class across all of our business components our balanced and alternatives asset classes were also negatively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period during the year ended december 31 2011  our equity aum decreased in line with equity markets globally as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this managements discussion and analysis the equity markets were extremely volatile during the year ended december 31 2011  of the 439 billion increase in aum resulting from market gains during the year ended december 31 2010 334 billion was due to the change in value of our equity asset class in line with increases in the sp 500 and the ftse 100 indices of 128 and 90 respectively during that period of the 547 billion increase in aum resulting from market increases during the year ended december 31 2009  421 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class in line with increases in the sp 500 and the ftse 100 indices of 235 and 221 respectively during that period 

foreign exchange rate movements in our aum result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as nonus dollar denominated aum is translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2011  was driven primarily by the weakening of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased aum into us dollars the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our canadian dollarbased aum into us dollars the weakening of the euro relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our eurobased aum into us dollars partly offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our yenbased aum into us dollars the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended december 31 2010  was driven primarily by the strengthening of the japanese yen and canadian dollar relative to the us dollar partially offset by the weakening of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2009  was driven by the strengthening of the pound sterling canadian dollar and euro relative 

  

to the us dollar 

the table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates for translation into the us dollar the reporting currency of the company at december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  



net revenue yield decreased 17 basis points to 457 basis points in the year ended december 31 2011  from the year ended december 31 2010  level of 474 basis points market driven changes in our asset mix significantly impact our net revenue yield our equity aum generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market aum at december 31 2011  equity aum were 2710 billion  representing 43  of our total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2010  equity aum were 2940 billion representing 48 of our total aum at that date in addition etf uit and passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes at december 31 2011  etf uit and passive aum were 963 billion  representing 154  of total aum at that date whereas at december 31 2010  etf uit and passive aum were 808 billion representing 131 of our total aum at that date 

gross revenue yield on aum decreased 11 basis points to 649 basis points in the year ended december 31 2011  from the year ended december 31 2010  level of 660 basis points management does not consider gross revenue yield the most comparable us gaapbased measure to net revenue yield to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure operating revenues excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products however the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products therefore the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the companys true effective fee rate from aum see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues gross revenues to net revenues

adoption of guidance now encompassed in accounting standards codification asc topic 810 “consolidation” 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies” and note 20 “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

the guidance now encompassed in asc topic 810 which was effective january 1 2010 had a significant impact on the presentation of the companys financial statements in 2011 and 2010 as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain clos that were not previously consolidated in accordance with the standard prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these clos 

the majority of the companys consolidated investment products balances were clorelated as of december 31 2011  and 2010 the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the companys minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets additionally the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability the discussion that follows will separate consolidated investment product results of operations from the companys investment management operations through the use of nongaap financial measures see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 



operating revenues increased by 173  in the year ended december 31 2011  to 40922 million  year ended december 31 2010  34877 million  net revenues increased  by 150  in in the year ended december 31 2011  to 28984 million  year ended december 31 2010  25211 million  net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements plus management and performance fees 

  

earned from less other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 749 million   124  of the increase  in operating revenues and was 18  of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2011  when compared to the year ended december 31 2010  additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum as more fully discussed below movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period 

the company acquired morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” on june 1 2010 the operating results for the year ended december 31 2010  include the operating results of the acquired business from the purchase date of june 1 2010 through december 31 2010  while the operating results for the year ended december 31 2011 include the results of the acquisition for the entire year the integration of the acquired business was largely completed at the end of 2010 as such accurate segregated revenue and expense information for the acquired business is not available resulting in the inability of the company to quantify the impact of the acquisition on operating revenues and expenses in the detailed variance discussion that follows 

as part of the acquisitionrelated us mutual fund product alignment 70 of the 71 planned us funds mergers are complete as of december 31 2011  as a consequence of the alignment certain 1 year and 2 year fee waivers were agreed between the company and the fund boards which will reduce the company’s annual management fees by approximately 30 million commencing june 1 2011 

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees increased  by 4176 million   153  in the year ended december 31 2011  to 31385 million  year ended december 31 2010  27209 million  the increase compares to a 192 increase in average aum and a 221  increase in average longterm aum as discussed above in the “assets under management” section the mix of our aum asset classes changed partly due to the aum acquired through acquisitions and partly due to market value changes and investor flows such that the revenue yield on our average aum was lower in 2011 when compared to 2010 the percentage increase in investment management fees is therefore lower than the percentage increase in average aum and average longterm aum the lower yield also reflects the acquisitionrelated us mutual fund fee waivers that commenced in june 2011 foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 672 million   161  of the increase  in investment management fees during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in the year ended december 31 2011  service and distribution fees increased  by 1348 million   209  to 7803 million  year ended december 31 2010  6455 million  primarily due to the acquisition and due to the increase in average aum during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  

  

performance fees 

performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with method 1 of asc topic 60520s99 “revenue recognition  services  sec materials” cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect we have performance fee arrangements that include monthly quarterly and annual measurement dates given the uniqueness of each transaction performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies if performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance of our 6253 billion  in aum at december 31 2011  approximately 480 billion  or 77  could potentially earn performance fees 

in the year ended december 31 2011  performance fees increased  by 118 million   452  to 379 million  year ended december 31 2010 261 million  the performance fees generated in 2011 arose primarily due to products managed by the european real estate group 119 million atlantic trust 119 million invesco perpetual 53 million and the us private equity business 45 million the performance fees generated in 2010 arose primarily due to products managed by the european real estate group 43 million invesco perpetual 34 million and atlantic trust 118 million 

other revenues 

other revenues include fees derived from our uit operations transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds these transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products 

following the acquisition the company is the sponsor of uits in its capacity as sponsor of uits the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of uit products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new uit products these revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute uits to investors 

in the year ended december 31 2011  other revenues increased  by 403 million   423  to 1355 million  year ended december 31 2010  952 million  other revenues included an increase of 153 million  in uit revenues reflecting a full year of the acquisition higher real estate acquisition and disposition fees of 115 million  due to increased real estate fund property activity an 113 million  increase in transaction commissions generated by our private equity group and an increase in mutual funds front end fees of 13 million  offset by a 07 million  decline in other revenues during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  the impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 14 million   35  of the increase  in other revenues during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include periodic “renewal” commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution service and advisory expenses for the uk and canada where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues as noted above 

  

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased  by 2287 million   217  in the year ended december 31 2011  to 12825 million  year ended december 31 2010  10538 million  which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues reflecting the impact of the acquired business foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 247 million   108  of the increase  in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint   venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the companys most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49  investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

the 19   decrease  in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments to 414 million  in 2011  year ended december 31 2010  422 million  is driven by the decline in average aum of the invesco great wall joint venture our share of the invesco great wall joint ventures average aum for the year ended december 31 2011  was 33 billion  a 83   decline  in average aum from 36 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  

management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products increased  by 20 million  to 473 million  in the year ended december 31 2011  year ended december 31 2010  453 million  the increase reflects the management fees from real estate products consolidated as of december 31 2010 in connection with the acquisition of aig asia real estate 

  

operating expenses 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 



the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense 



during the year ended december 31 2011  operating expenses increased by 2963 million   102  to 31941 million  year ended december 31 2010  28978 million  as discussed above the acquisition occurred on june 1 2010 which increased expenses across all categories except transaction and integration expenses which have decreased during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  

in addition to the acquired business foreign exchange differences have an impact on our reported expense variances the impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 618 million   209  of the increase in operating expenses and was 19  of total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010

in the year ended december 31 2010  interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products were 2409 million and 1186 million respectively the balances reflect the adoption of guidance now encompassed in asc topic 810 on january 1 2010 in accordance with the standard prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation 

gains and losses of consolidated investment products net income impact of consolidated investment products and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

included in other income and expenses are gains and losses of consolidated investment products net which are driven by realized and unrealized gains and losses of underlying investments held by consolidated investment products in the year ended december 31 2010  other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net gain of 1140 million as compared to a net loss of 1069 million in the year ended december 31 2009  the net gain in the period is primarily due to changes in market values of investments held by consolidated private equity funds 

as illustrated in the condensed consolidating statements of income for the year ended december 31  2010  and 2009  at the beginning of this results of operations section the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31 2010  resulted in an increase to net income of 1807 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests invesco invests in only 

  

a portion of these products and as a result this net gain is offset by noncontrolling interests of 1709 million resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of 98 million consolidated investment products had no material net income impact to the company for the year ended december 31 2009  

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in consolidated investment products movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the companys consolidated statements of income generally offset the gains and losses interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products 

other gains and losses net 

other gains and losses net were a net gain of 156 million in the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to a net gain of 78 million in the year ended december 31 2009  included in other gains and losses is a net gain of 142 million as a result of the appreciation of assets held for our deferred compensation plans year ended december 31 2009  none together with 92 million of net realized gains from seed investments year ended december 31 2009  37 million net realized gains the 2010  other gains and losses also included 66 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds year ended december 31 2009  30 million and 04 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our clo products year ended december 31 2009  52 million in the year ended december 31 2010  we incurred 02 million in net foreign exchange losses year ended december 31 2009  84 million in net foreign exchange gains on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries in addition included in the 2009 net gain is a gross gain generated upon a debt tender offer of 43 million 33 million net of related expenses 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for 2010  was 297 down from 315 for 2009  the rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pretax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed the rate decrease was partially offset by nondeductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business and a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2010  versus 2009  

the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities decreased our effective tax rate to 236 in 2010  and increased it to 415 in 2009  the 2010 rate was lower than 2009 due to a lower impact from losses in noncontrolling interests 

  

schedule of nongaap information 

beginning with the presentation of the companys results for the three months ended march 31 2010 the company expanded its use of nongaap measures to include reconciling items primarily relating to guidance now encompassed in the accounting standards codification topic 810 discussed in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies” and the acquisition of morgan stanleys retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” we are presenting the following nongaap measures net revenue and by calculation net revenue yield on aum adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted earnings per share eps we believe these nongaap measures provide greater transparency into our business and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and they are consistent with internal management reporting the most directly comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income and by calculation operating margin net income and by calculation diluted eps each of these measures is discussed more fully below 

these nongaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these nongaap measures if deemed appropriate 

also beginning with the presentation of the companys results for the three months ended march 31 2010 the net revenue measure has been redefined from that previously used to adjust for the impact of consolidating certain investment products 

the presentation of net revenue in this report for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 2008 and 2007 have been restated to conform the calculation to the current periods methodology see part ii item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  reclassifications for additional information 

the following are reconciliations of operating revenues operating income and by calculation operating margin and net income and by calculation diluted eps on a us gaap basis to net revenues adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and by calculation adjusted diluted eps 

  



 

 

 

 

  

 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions management fee rebates and distribution costs 12b1 and marketing support paid to brokers and independent financial advisors see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 accounting policies revenue recognition for additional details while the terms used for these types of expense vary by geography they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum and the related computation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of and distribute the company’s managed funds further these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with us peer investment managers and within invesco’s own investment units additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes 

  

 

the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 67 billion  as of december 31 2011  the company has a 490 interest in invesco great wall the company also has a 50 joint venture with huaneng capital services to assess private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the companys financial statements as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business it is also consistent with the presentation of aum and net flows where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum 

 

see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20  “consolidated investment products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of investment products the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap condensed consolidated statements of income 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a readers analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues operating income and operating margin for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating the respective net revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the operating and nonoperating income and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the us gaap consolidated statements of income 

 

acquisitionrelated adjustments include transaction and integration expenses and intangible asset amortization related 

  

to acquired assets amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co and tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets these charges reflect the legal regulatory advisory valuation integrationrelated employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees general and administrative costs including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction and the post closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the preacquisition period with respect to various closedend funds included in the acquisition see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19  “commitments and contingencies” for additional information additionally acquisitionrelated reconciling items include changes in estimates of acquisition earnout liabilities booked from prior acquisitions which is offset in the period by increased amortization related to the writeoff of related management contract intangible assets the us gaap to nongaap reconciling items also include acquisitionrelated amortization charges related to previous business combinations the tax benefit is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit 

management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges and the amortization expenses in arriving at adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted eps as this will aid comparability of our results period to period and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisitionrelated charges 

while finitelived intangible assets are amortized under us gaap there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in certain qualifying situations these can be amortized for tax purposes generally over a 15year period as is the case in the us these cash flows in the form of reduced taxes payable represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business we believe it is useful to include these tax cash flow benefits in arriving at the adjusted eps measure the company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under us gaap is not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations 

 

certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation depreciation of specified investments typically the funds managed by the employee invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet us gaap requires the appreciation depreciation in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense the full value of the investment appreciation depreciation is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multiyear vesting period during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense operating income and operating margin in a manner which over the life of the award will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income the nongaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

since these plans are hedged economically management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income and by calculation adjusted operating margin and adjusted net income and by calculation adjusted eps to produce results that will be more comparable period to period the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period the nongaap measures therefore exclude the mismatch created by differing us gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments 

additionally dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s consolidated statements of income on the record dates this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company the nongaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense 

  

  

 

expenses related to the companys european infrastructure alignment efforts represent primarily severance and consulting costs associated with the companys fund rationalization and distribution efforts in europe for the year ended december 31 2011 this adjustment includes 76 million in compensation expenses primarily due to severance costs  53 million in general and administrative costs primarily related to consulting services and 59 million of property and technology costs the companys income tax provision included tax benefits of 19 million in the the year ended december 31 2011 

management does not include these costs in internal reporting and these costs do not form part of the overall evaluation of the business management therefore believes that the exclusion of these costs due to their incremental nature and projected magnitude from total operating expenses provides useful information to investors as this view is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the business exclusion of these costs will aid in comparability of our results from periods to period and the comparability of our results with those of peer investment managers 

 

included within other gains and losses in the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2011 is a credit of 450 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor included within general and administrative expenses are legal fees associated with this litigation of 36 million the companys income tax provision included a taxation charge of 156 million related to the settlement credit net of legal fees

included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended december 31 2010 is a charge of 89 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds the company’s income tax provision includes tax benefits of 29 million relating to this charge a 03 million credit was recorded in the year ended december 31 2011 reflecting the final amount reimbursed together with an associated 01 million tax charge 

management does not include these items in internal reporting and these items do not form part of the overall evaluation of the business management therefore believes that the exclusion of these items due to their unique character and magnitude from net income provides useful information to investors as this view is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the business exclusion of these items will aid in comparability of our results from period to period and the comparability of our results with those of peer investment managers

goodwill 

goodwill decreased  from 69802 million  at december 31 2010  to 69079 million  at december 31 2011  see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 7 goodwill for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods the companys annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year as a result of that analysis the company determined that no impairment existed at that date see “critical accounting policies  goodwill” for additional details of the companys goodwill impairment analysis process

liquidity and capital resources 

our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility proceeds from the public offering of our shares and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements the companys 5625 senior notes of 2151 million at december 31 2011 mature on april 17 2012 as of the date of this report the company expects to use its existing cash flows from operations and credit facility to satisfy the upcoming maturity and has no plans to issue new senior notes during 2010 sp announced an upgrade of our credit rating from bbbpositive to astable also in 2010 invesco became and remains as of the date of this report one of only four publicly rated investment managers designated with a “strong” enterprise risk management rating from sp standard  poors rates companies enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of fair adequate strong and excellent

the coverage ratios as defined in our credit facility were as follows during 2011  2010  and 2009  





  



 

 

the december 31 2011  coverage ratio calculations are as follows 



 

 

 

we have received credit ratings of a3stable and astable from moodys and standard and poors credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt these credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by moodys or standard  poors each rating should be evaluated independently see also part i item 1a  risk factors for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings 

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the companys liquidity and capital resources the executive overview of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a broader discussion of the companys overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with 

  

external high creditquality financial institutions however we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 12847 million  in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 19 “commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet commitments” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments and support agreements 

  

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2011  



 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  note 1 “accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below however the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

taxation we operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

  

net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the us uk and canada based on managements belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

goodwill  our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2011  and 2010  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary however the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 69079 million  and 69802 million  at december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the companys assets under management or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees 

the october 1 2011 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2010 annual impairment tests with assumptions updated for current market conditions including the companys updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses market gains are based upon historical returns of the sp 500 index treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns as applicable to the companys aum mix on the testing date the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the most significant change in assumptions from 2010 related to an increase in the market risk premium which resulted in a discount rate of 160 for the october 1 2011 analysis 2010 149 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates a 30 decline in fair value or more than a 400 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our october 1 2011 goodwill impairment analysis would be required to cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the market value thus triggering step two of the goodwill impairment test the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments 

intangible assets  where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definitelived intangible assets will contribute to the companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a definitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the companys amortization expense which was 422 million  303 million  and 126 million  for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including aum growth rates product mix effective fee rates pretax profit margins effective tax rates and discount rates the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions in 2011 2010 and 2009 annual impairment reviews of indefinitelived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates the classifications of indefinitelived and definitelived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definitelived intangible assets were required 

  

investments most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values of our 4845 million  total investments at december 31 2011  those most susceptible to impairment include 635 million  seed money investments in our affiliated funds seed money investments are investments held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one three and fiveyear historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets we also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

consolidated investment products assessing if an entity is a vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are vies 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns for investment products other than clos involves estimation and probability assumptions for clos there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly effect the clos economic results and to assess if the companys interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income 

as of december 31 2011  the company consolidated vies that held investments of 57251 million   december 31 2010  62642 million  and voe fund investments of 9038 million   december 31 2010  9413 million  as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes 

contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event that is 

  

both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes as well as various contractual obligations and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other noncurrent liabilities as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from state or federal agencies if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business

invesco ltd is organized under the laws of bermuda and our common shares are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ivz” we maintain a web site at wwwinvescocom information contained on our web site shall not be deemed to be part of or be incorporated into this document 

strategy 

the company focuses on four key strategic priorities that are designed to strengthen our business over time and help ensure our longterm success 

 

 

since 2005 invesco has taken a number of steps to further unify our business and present the organization as a single firm to our clients around the world we believe these changes have strengthened invesco’s ability to operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization 

since we take a unified approach to our business we present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management” 

recent developments 

on june 1 2010 invesco acquired morgan stanley’s retail asset management business including van kampen investments the addition of this diversified business brought 1146 billion in aum across equity fixed income and alternative asset classes including mutual funds variable insurance funds separate accounts and unit investment trusts uits furthermore invesco gained the experience knowledge and expertise of nearly 600 investment distribution and operations support professionals globally this transformational combination 

 

our goal from the day we announced the transaction was to complete the preparatory integration work prior to close with a focused effort across invesco we accomplished our goal and were able to deliver the value of the combined organization to clients from day 1 throughout the second half of 2010 we saw strong momentum in the combined business 

in addition to our acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business invesco’s commitment to a multiyear strategy set a firm foundation for the company’s many achievements throughout the year during 2010 

 

 

 5 

together these efforts resulted in positive net flows for our business in 2010 adjusted operating margin improved to 345 in 2010 from 285 in 2009 see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and by calculation a reconciliation of operating margin to adjusted operating margin and important additional disclosures 

throughout 2010 we continued to execute our longterm strategy making disciplined capital and resource allocation decisions which we believe further improved our ability to serve our clients reinforced our reputation as a premier global investment manager and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins as we progressed through the year in addition we took steps to further strengthen our financial position and augment our capital flexibility through the execution of a new credit facility and the maintenance of a balanced approach to capital management we have received credit ratings of a3stable and astable from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k in the fourth quarter standard  poor’s increased invesco’s enterprise risk management erm rating from “adequate” to “strong” making invesco one of only four publicly rated investment managers with a “strong” erm designation 

certain demographic and industry trends 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and our business and underscore the need to be welldiversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes 

 

invesco is well positioned to capture the opportunities created by global demographic and industry trends through a variety of economic and market environments our progress over the past five years has significantly strengthened our competitive position our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and ensure our longterm success 

investment management capabilities 

supported by a global operating platform invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail institutional and highnetworth investors on a global basis we have a significant presence in the institutional and retail segments of the investment management industry in north america europe and asiapacific serving clients in more than 150 countries 

we believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment centers and their welldefined investment disciplines provide us with a competitive advantage there are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as invesco’s and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles we offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage our asset classes broadly defined include money market fixed income balanced equity and alternatives approximately 48 of our aum as of december 31 2010 were invested in equity securities december 31 2009 41 and approximately 52 was invested in fixed income and other investments december 31 2009 59 

the following table sets forth the investment objectives sorted by asset class which we manage

distribution channels 

channel refers to the distribution channel from which the aum originated retail aum arose from client investments into funds available to the public with shares or units institutional aum originated from individual corporate clients endowments foundations government authorities universities or charities private wealth management aum arose from high net worth client investments 

retail 

invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets invesco in the us invesco trimark in canada invesco perpetual in the uk invesco in europe and asia and invesco powershares for our etf products additionally invesco is now also a market leading sponsor of uit products as a result of the acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business collectively the retail investment management teams managed assets of 3784 billion as of december 31 2010 we offer retail products within all of the major asset classes money market fixed income balanced equity and alternatives our retail products are primarily distributed through thirdparty financial intermediaries including traditional brokerdealers fund “supermarkets” retirement platforms financial advisors banks insurance companies and trust companies 

the uk us and canadian retail operations rank among the largest by aum in their respective markets as of december 31 2010 invesco perpetual was the no 1 retail fund provider in the uk invesco’s us retail business was the 9th largest nonproprietary fund complex in the us by longterm assets including the invesco powershares franchise and invesco trimark was the 9th largest retail fund manager in canada by longterm assets invesco great wall our joint venture in china was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with aum of approximately 72 billion as of december 31 2010 invesco powershares adds a leading set of etf products with 557 billion in aum and 176 exchangetraded funds as of december 31 2010 to the extensive choices we make available to our retail investors we provide our retail clients with one of the industry’s most robust and comprehensive product lines

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the quality and diversity of our investment styles product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both distribute andor serve investment products and manage investment products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategy will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts as well as certain etfs investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days’ notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional and private wealth management clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods

 item 1a risk factors 

volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy can negatively affect invesco’s revenues and may continue to do so 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing substantial volatility and disruption since 2007 while these disruptions moderated to some extent following the march 2009 lows in equity markets historical norms have not returned and the potential for extreme disruptions remains these market events have materially impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so and could materially impact our financial condition and liquidity in this regard 

 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets 

if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues would be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under our management as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management assets under management may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain fixed factors that could decrease assets under management and therefore revenues include the following 

  declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated approximately 48 of our total assets under management were invested in equity securities and approximately 52 were invested in fixed income and other investments at december 31 2010 our aum as of january 31 2011 was 6243 billion we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our assets under management are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

  redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional or individual accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts therefore our revenues may decline if clients shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

  declines in the value of seed capital and partnership investments the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and partnership investments as of december 31 2010 the company had 1980 million in seed capital and partnership investments 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days’ notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund’s board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the board of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts of invesco or our subsidiaries generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under our management and individual clients may elect to close their accounts redeem their shares in our funds or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or assets under management would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its net asset value although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining net asset value some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have 329 million invested in invesco mortgage capital inc 233 million of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products and 71 million invested in fixed income seed money at december 31 2010 the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict business activities subsidiaries operating in the european union eu also are subject to various eu directives which are implemented by member state national legislation possible sanctions include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities a subgroup of invesco subsidiaries including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2010 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4562 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company invesco ltd we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes could impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

various changes in law and regulation have been enacted or adopted and are beginning to be implemented or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007 various other proposals remain under consideration by various legislators regulators other government officials and other public policy commentators certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and depending upon their implementation could have a material impact on invesco’s business while many of these provisions appear designed to address perceived problems in the banking sector certain of the provisions will or may be applied to other financial services companies including investment managers 

in the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law on july 21 2010 while invesco does not at this time believe that the doddfrank act will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its fundamental strategy it does appear that certain provisions will and other provisions may increase regulatory burdens and related compliance costs in addition the scope of many provisions of the doddfrank act will be determined by implementing regulations some of which will require lengthy proposal and promulgation periods moreover the doddfrank act mandates many regulatory studies some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry which could lead to additional legislation or regulation as a result of these uncertainties regarding implementation of the doddfrank act and such other future potential legislative or regulatory changes the impact of the doddfrank act on the investment management industry and invesco cannot be predicted at this time 

the european union has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services including investment managers such directives are progressing at various stages and are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states as with the doddfrank act invesco does not believe implementation of these directives will fundamentally change our industry or cause us to reconsider our fundamental strategy but it does appear certain provisions will and other provisions may increase regulatory burdens and compliance costs similar developments are being implemented or considered in other jurisdictions where we do business such developments could have similar effects 

potential developments under enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes and related matters include 

 

 

invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes on its business it is possible such changes could impose new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invesco’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and results of operations might be adversely affected 

civil litigation and governmental enforcement actions and investigations could adversely affect our assets under management and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of key individuals or significant investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and our good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries material errors in public reports employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed further our business requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client or those of invesco we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage conflicts of interest but this task can be complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail — or appear to fail — to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify guidelines or contractual requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and net income to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations 

  competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

as part of our business strategy we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets including for purposes of financing potential acquisitions depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3stable and astable from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k according to moody’s obligations rated ‘a’ are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk invesco’s rating of a3 is at the low end of the a range a1 a2 a3 but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of baa3 standard and poor’s rating of a is at the lower end of the a rating with bbb representing standard and poor’s lowest investment grade rating according to standard and poor’s a obligations exhibit a strong capacity to meet financial commitments but are somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our revenues are somewhat exposed to equity market volatility negative tangible equity potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry and integration risk related to the acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these 

factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our long or shortterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues continued volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position 

as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding total debt of 13157 million and total equity attributable to common shareholders of 77691 million excluding retained earnings appropriated for investors in consolidated investment products the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 

we sell a significant portion of our investment products through a variety of financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and financial organizations in europe and asia increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues following the financial crisis there has been consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these trends continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other unconflicted third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular client’s needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future if one of our major distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients’ data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success in recent periods illiquid markets for certain types of securities have required increased use of fair value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty vendors these systems or vendors could suffer deficiencies failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to regularly assess and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our assets under management is presently derived from the united states however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 69802 million and 11617 million respectively at december 31 2010 2009 64676 million and 1106 million respectively we may not realize the value of such assets we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies — goodwill” and “— intangibles” for additional details of the company’s goodwill impairment analysis process 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda “companies act” the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances directors and officers may owe duties to a company’s creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

our byelaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries’ income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances

in july 2010 various closedend funds formerly advised by van kampen investments or morgan stanley investment management included in the acquired business had complaints filed against them in new york state court commencing derivative lawsuits purportedly brought on behalf of the common shareholders of those funds the funds are nominal defendants in these derivative lawsuits and the defendants also include van kampen investments acquired by invesco on june 1 2010 morgan stanley investment management and certain officers and trustees of the funds who are or were employees of those firms invesco has certain obligations under the applicable acquisition agreement regarding the defense costs and any damages associated with this litigation the plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties owed by the nonfund defendants to the funds’ common shareholders related to the funds’ redemption in prior periods of auction rate preferred securities “arps” theretofore issued by the funds the complaints are similar to other complaints recently filed against investment advisers officers and trustees of closedend funds in other fund complexes which issued and redeemed arps the complaints allege that the advisers distributors and certain officers and trustees of those funds breached their fiduciary duty by redeeming arps at their liquidation value when there was no obligation to do so and when the value of arps in the secondary marketplace were significantly below their liquidation value the complaints also allege that the arps redemptions were principally motivated by the fund sponsors’ interests to preserve distribution relationships with brokers and other financial intermediaries who held arps after having repurchased them from their own clients certain other funds included in the acquired business have received demand letters expressing similar allegations such demand letters could be precursors to additional similar lawsuits being commenced against those other funds the boards of trustees of the funds are evaluating the complaints and demand letters and have established special committees of independent trustees to conduct an inquiry regarding the allegations invesco believes the cases should be dismissed following completion of such review period although there can be no assurance of that result invesco intends to defend vigorously any cases which may survive beyond initial motions to dismiss 

the investment management industry also is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the united states and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the us and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate any material loss of investor andor client confidence as a result of such inquiries andor litigation could result in a significant decline in assets under management which would have an adverse effect on the company’s future financial results and its ability to grow its business 

in the normal course of its business the company is subject to various litigation matters although there can be no assurances at this time management believes based on information currently available to it that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

invesco is a leading independent global investment manager with offices in more than 20 countries as of december 31 2010 we managed 6165 billion in assets for retail institutional and highnetworth investors around the world by delivering the combined power of our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities invesco provides a comprehensive array of enduring solutions for our clients we have a significant presence in the institutional and retail segments of the investment management industry in north america uk europe and asiapacific serving clients in more than 150 countries 

despite a number of challenges during the year including the us equity market flash crash in may the heightened risk of european sovereign default and continued uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery most global equity markets achieved positive returns in 2010 marking the second year of recovery from the financial crisis as illustrated in the chart below 

the response to these challenges by governments and central banks around the world of providing additional fiscal and monetary stimulus led to an investor environment that favored riskier assets as yields on less risky government bonds reached record lows as a result most global equity markets achieved positive returns in 2010 with the sp 500 climbing almost 13 the ftse 100 rising 9 and the msci eafe index gaining nearly 5 the exception was the equity market in japan which declined 3 as the strength in the japanese yen up almost 15 against the us dollar in 2010 negatively impacted the profits of japanese exporters and multinational corporations the table below summarizes the year ended december 31 returns of several major market indices for 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

both treasury markets and corporate credit markets achieved positive returns in 2010 as well treasury securities benefited from the combination of the “flight to quality” trade in the first half of the year coinciding with the us equity market flash crash and increased risk of default by some european governments as well as the federal reserve beginning the second round of quantitative easing a process whereby the federal reserve creates new money to purchase treasury securities for the year 10year treasury notes gained 8 while shorter dated 3 and 5year notes gained 5 and 7 respectively corporate credit markets benefited from improved fundamentals as earnings improved and corporations stockpiled cash further the stimulus efforts from central bankers around the globe provided support as yields on government securities reached record lows and fixed income investors moved out the credit risk curve in search of higher yields for the year investment grade credit gained 90 while highyield bonds returned 146 

invesco continued to make progress in a number of areas that better positioned our company as the markets continue their measured return to prefinancial crisis levels throughout the course of 2010 the company’s financial performance strengthened in addition during this period invesco continued to strengthen its competitive position with respect to investment performance maintained its focus on its clients and enhanced its profile in the industry 

a critical factor in invesco’s ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management our risk management framework provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company our global performance measurement and risk group provides senior management and the board with insight into core investment risks while our corporate risk management committee facilitates a focus on strategic operational and all other business risks further business component functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business through this regular and consistent risk communication the board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a riskaware culture in which effective risk management is built into the fabric of the business 

in addition we benefited from having a diversified asset base one of invesco’s core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world invesco is also diversified by asset class with approximately 48 of our assets under management in equities and the remaining 52 invested in fixed income and other investments this broad diversification enables invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

on june 1 2010 the company acquired morgan stanley’s retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” in exchange for a combination of 7700 million in cash paid and 309 million common shares and common share equivalents which were subsequently sold as converted to unrelated third parties the acquisition added assets under management across equity fixed income and alternative asset classes including mutual funds variable insurance funds separate accounts and uits more specifically this acquisition 

 

presentation of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity real estate fundoffunds collateralized loan obligation products clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 “accounting policies” and note 20 “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

effective january 1 2010 the company adopted guidance now encompassed in accounting standards codification topic 810 “consolidation” the adoption of this new guidance had a significant impact on the presentation of the company’s financial statements in 2010 as its provisions required the company to consolidate certain clos that were not previously consolidated in accordance with the standard prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these clos the majority of the company’s consolidated investment products balances were clorelated as of december 31 2010 the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos the company has no right to the benefits from nor does it bear the risks associated with the collateral assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from the clos if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets additionally the investors in the clos have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability 

the impact of consolidation of investment products is so significant to the presentation of company’s financial statements but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company that combined with the presentation of newlyincurred transaction and integration costs and additional intangible asset amortization resulting from the acquired business the company expanded its use of nongaap measures beginning with the presentation of the company’s results for the three months ended march 31 2010 the discussion that follows therefore combines results presented under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with the company’s nongaap presentation there are four distinct sections within this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations after the assets under management discussion 

 

each of the financial statement summary sections results of operations balance sheet discussion and liquidity and capital resources begins with a table illustrating the impact of the consolidation of investment products the narrative that follows each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company before consolidation of investment products as well as of the financial statement activity of consolidated investment products additionally wherever a nongaap measure is referenced a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of nongaap information where additional details regarding the use of the nongaap measure by the company are disclosed along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable us gaap measures to the nongaap measures to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section separate tables for each of the revenue expense and nonoperating incomeexpense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows providing a sectionbysection review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented 

summary operating information 

summary operating information for 2010 2009 and 2008 is presented in the table below 

 

 

 

 a significant portion of our business and aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling and the canadian dollar will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from most global capital markets increased in the year ended december 31 2010 which also contributed to net increases in aum of 357 billion excluding acquisitions during the year aum at january 31 2011 was 6243 billion 

investment capabilities performance overview 

invesco’s first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients longterm performance in our equities capabilities as measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance within our equity asset class asian continental european and us core have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over three and fiveyear periods our us value and global exus and emerging markets have exceptional longterm performance with over 92 of assets ahead of benchmarks and peer group medians within our fixed income asset class global fixed income products have achieved strong longterm performance with at least 80 of aum ahead of benchmarks and 77 of aum ahead of peers on a 3year and 5year basis 

 

 

  assets under management 

the company’s rolling presentation of aum from period to period on the following pages illustrates longterm inflows and outflows separately from the net flows into institutional money market funds longterm inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients existing clients adding new accountsfunds or contributionssubscriptions into existing accountsfunds and new funding commitments into private equity funds we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically utilize them as shortterm funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to shortterm interest rate movements 

there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows including individual investor decisions to change their investment preferences fiduciaries making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of advised clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor’s decisionmaking process including their risk appetite or liquidity needs therefore the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows 

to align our external reporting of aum with how invesco is portrayed in the industry and to reflect more fully the company’s revenue drivers in the three months ended june 30 2010 the company changed its definition of aum to include assets with which the company is also associated the powershares qqqq etf powershares db etfs and other passive assets these products previously were not included in the company’s reported aum because the company does not receive investment management fees from these assets these assets are marketed as invesco products and to include them as part of our aum more accurately reflects the full size and capabilities of invesco additionally the company may receive meaningful performance service distribution or transaction revenues from these assets the inclusion of these assets as aum changed the following data points from those previously disclosed

additionally as a result of the acquisition the company now manages unit investment trust uit products which are categorized in this passive asset group and for which we earn revenues related to transactional sales charges from the sale of these products and trading income arising from securities temporarily held to form new uit products 

aum at december 31 2010 were 6165 billion december 31 2009 4595 billion december 31 2008 3771 billion the acquisition added 1146 billion in aum at june 1 2010 additionally during the year ended december 31 2010 other acquisitions added 69 billion of aum net of dispositions during the year ended december 31 2010 net inflows increased aum by 55 billion while positive market movements increased aum by 439 billion we experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of 155 billion and increases in aum of 16 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2010 during the year ended december 31 2009 net inflows increased aum by 166 billion and positive market movements increased aum by 547 billion we experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of 01 billion and increases in aum of 112 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2008 net outflows decreased aum by 203 billion and negative market movements decreased aum by 1130 billion we experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of 84 billion and decreases in aum of 273 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2008 average aum during the year ended december 31 2010 included the impact of the acquired business and were 5323 billion compared to 4158 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 and 4689 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 

net inflows during the year ended december 31 2010 included net longterm inflows of etf uit and passive aum of 43 billion and other net longterm inflows of 12 billion net flows were driven by net inflows into our institutional and high net worth distribution channels of 56 billion and 11 billion respectively primarily in the fixed income asset class while our retail distribution channel experienced net outflows of 12 billion 

market gains and lossesreinvestment of aum includes the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying investments from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends of the total increase in aum resulting from market gains during the year ended december 31 2010 334 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class across all of our business components our balanced and alternatives asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period during the year ended december 31 2010 our equity aum increased in line with equity markets globally as discussed in the “executive overview” section of this management’s discussion and analysis the sp 500 and the ftse 100 indices increased 128 and 90 respectively during the year ended december 31 2010 of the 547 billion increase in aum resulting from market increases during the year ended december 31 2009 421 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class in line with increases in the sp 500 and the ftse 100 indices of 235 and 221 respectively during that period of the 1130 billion decrease in aum resulting from market declines during the year ended december 31 2008 947 billion of this decrease was due to the change in value of our equity asset class in line with decreases in the sp 500 and the ftse 100 indices of 370 and 280 respectively during that period 

foreign exchange rate movements in our aum result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as nonus dollar denominated aum is translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2010 was driven primarily by the weakening of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our pound sterlingbased aum into us dollars the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our canadian dollarbased aum into us dollars and to the weakening of the euro relative to the us dollar which was reflected in the translation of our eurobased aum into us dollars the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2009 was driven by the strengthening of the pound sterling canadian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2008 was driven by the weakening of the pound sterling canadian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar

operating revenues and net revenues 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 

 

operating revenues increased by 327 in 2010 to 34877 million year ended december 31 2009 26273 million net revenues increased by 311 in 2010 to 26022 million year ended december 31 2009 19846 million net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 180 million 21 of the increase in operating revenues and was 05 of total operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2010 when compared to the year ended december 31 2009 additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum as more fully discussed below movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period 

as discussed in the company’s form 10q filings for the june 30 2010 and september 30 2010 periods the company acquired morgan stanley’s retail asset management business including van kampen investments the “acquired business” or the “acquisition” on june 1 2010 the acquisition had a significant impact on our results for the 2010 period the operating results for the year ended december 31 2010 include the operating results of the acquired business from the purchase date of june 1 2010 through december 31 2010 the integration of the acquired business is largely complete as such accurate segregated expense information for the acquired business is not available prior to any significant product mergers revenues associated with the acquired business can be separately identified and as a result the impact can be estimated operating revenues of the acquired business for the year ended december 31 2010 were approximately 468 million which represents the incremental impact of the acquired business and does not represent the standalone results of the acquired business 

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees increased by 6007 million 283 in the year ended december 31 2010 to 27209 million year ended december 31 2009 21202 million due to the acquisition increases in average aum primarily retail aum changes in the mix of aum between asset classes and foreign exchange rate movement the acquisition contributed to the increase in investment management fees with an estimated 257 million in these fees during the year ended december 31 2010 average longterm aum which generally earn higher fee rates than money market aum increased 410 to 4635 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 from 3288 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 while average institutional money market aum decreased 209 to 688 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 from 870 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in average 

longterm aum includes the impact of the acquired business see the company’s disclosures regarding the changes in aum during the year ended december 31 2010 in the “assets under management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum foreign exchange rate movements led to an increase in investment management fees of 170 million 28 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 

additionally the change in investment management fee revenues reflects the adoption of guidance now encompassed in asc topic 810 on january 1 2010 as part of the consolidation management fees earned from consolidated clos and other products of 453 million were eliminated from the company’s operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 in accordance with the standard prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these clos the company uses a nongaap financial measure net revenues to add back these eliminated management fees as part of net revenues as the company has earned them for providing investment management services to the consolidated investment products see “schedule of nongaap information” for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues 

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in 2010 service and distribution fees increased by 2329 million 564 to 6455 million year ended december 31 2009 4126 million the acquisition contributed an estimated 172 million of the increase in service and distribution fees in the year ended december 31 2010 the remaining increase is largely attributable to the increase in average aum during the year 

performance fees 

performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with method 1 of asc topic 60520s99 “revenue recognition — services — sec materials” cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect we have performance fee arrangements that include monthly quarterly and annual measurement dates given the uniqueness of each transaction performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies if performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance of our 6165 billion in aum at december 31 2010 only approximately 368 billion or 59 could potentially earn performance fees of the 1146 billion aum acquired on june 1 2010 through the acquisition 27 billion or 24 are eligible to earn performance fees 

in the year ended december 31 2010 performance fees decreased by 39 million 130 to 261 million year ended december 31 2009 300 million the performance fees generated in 2010 arose primarily due to products managed by the european real estate group 43 million invesco perpetual 34 million and atlantic trust 118 million the performance fees generated in 2009 arose primarily due to products managed by the invesco global strategies group 24 million invesco perpetual 134 million and atlantic trust 57 million 

other revenues 

other revenues include fees derived from our uit operations transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties private equity 

transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds these transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products 

following the acquisition the company is the sponsor of uits in its capacity as sponsor of uits the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of uit products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new uit products these revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute uits to investors 

in the year ended december 31 2010 other revenues increased by 307 million 476 to 952 million year ended december 31 2009 645 million increases in other revenues included 389 million in uit revenues during the year a result of the acquired business and higher real estate acquisition and disposition fees of 24 million which were offset by a 52 million decline in transaction commissions 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include periodic “renewal” commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients’ assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution service and advisory expenses for the uk and canada where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues as noted above 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses increased by 2793 million 403 in the year ended december 31 2010 to 9727 million year ended december 31 2009 6934 million which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues foreign exchange rate movements increased thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses by 53 million 19 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement is our 490 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

the 56 decrease in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses to 422 million in 2010 year ended december 31 2009 447 million is driven by the decline in average aum of the invesco great wall joint venture our share of the invesco great wall joint venture’s average aum for the year ended december 31 2010 was 36 billion a 27 decline in average aum from 37 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 

management fees earned from consolidated investment products 

management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader’s analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company accordingly management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

management fees earned from consolidated investment products increased by 373 million to 453 million in the year ended december 31 2010 year ended december 31 2009 80 million the increase reflects the adoption of guidance now encompassed in asc topic 810 on january 1 2010 clo management fees of 354 million were eliminated from the company’s operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 in accordance with the standard prior periods have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of these clos 

other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products 

operating revenues of consolidated investment products are included in us gaap operating revenues resulting from the consolidation of investment products into the company’s results of operations management believes that this consolidation could impact a reader’s analysis of our underlying results of operations therefore management believes that it is appropriate to deduct operating revenues of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 

operating expenses 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 

 

the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense

in addition to the acquired business foreign exchange differences have a large impact on our expenses a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for 132 million 17 of the increase in operating expenses and was 05 of total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2010

income tax expense 

our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world each with its own statutory income tax rate as a result our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries the majority of our profits are earned in the us canada and the uk the current uk statutory tax rate is 28 the canadian statutory tax rate is 31 and the us federal statutory tax rate is 35 

on december 14 2007 legislation was enacted to reduce the canadian income tax rate over five years which changed the rate to 335 in 2008 and 330 in 2009 the legislation was revised in december 2009 further reducing the rate to 310 in 2010 2825 in 2011 2625 in 2012 255 in 2013 and 25 thereafter on july 27 2010 legislation was introduced to reduce the uk income tax rate to 27 on april 1 2011 further reductions to the rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1 per year to 24 by april 1 2014 these reductions are expected to be introduced in future finance bills for each annual reduction 

our effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for 2010 was 297 down from 315 for 2009 the rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pretax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed the rate decrease was partially offset by nondeductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business and a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2010 versus 2009 

the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities decreased our effective tax rate to 236 in 2010 and increased it to 415 in 2009 the 2009 rate was higher than 2008 due to a larger impact from losses in noncontrolling interests

assets held by the clos beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in and management fees generated from these products which are eliminated upon consolidation if the company were to liquidate the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company and as a result the company does not consider them to be company assets additionally the investors in the clos debt tranches have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 20 “consolidated investment products” for additional details 

on july 28 2010 sp announced an upgrade of our credit rating from bbbpositive to astable in october 2010 invesco became one of only four public investment managers with a “strong” risk management rating from sp standard  poor’s rates companies’ enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of fair adequate strong and excellent 

we believe that our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility proceeds from the public offering of our shares and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements on june 1 2010 we used a combination of existing cash balances and 6500 million credit facility borrowing to satisfy the 7700 million cash consideration related to acquisition we issued 309 million shares of new equity in the form of common and nonvoting common equivalent preferred shares with economic rights identical to common stock other than no right to vote such shares to morgan stanley without holding restrictions in conjunction with the close the preferred shares were subsequently sold as converted to unrelated third parties the ultimate purchase price for the business was lower than the 15 billion previously announced purchase price due to depreciation of invesco’s common share price from the announcement date to the june 1 2010 closing date during the last two quarters we repurchased 94 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing 1922 million in cash we believe that the cash flow generated from operations of the combined firm the remaining 6800 million in credit facility capacity and our ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet future capital resource needs 

the following summary of our recent capital transactions confirms our ability to access capital markets in a timely manner 

 

our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities a subgroup of invesco subsidiaries including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable european union eu directives and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2010 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4562 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

in addition the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its uit broker dealer entity which was included in the acquired business at december 31 2010 these cash deposits totaled 149 million 

cash flows discussion 

the ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company’s fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

cash flows of consolidated investment products discussed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 20 “consolidated investment products” are reflected in invesco’s cash used in operating activities provided by investing activities and provided by financing activities cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products accordingly the table below presents the cash flows of the company separately and before consolidation of investment products as the cash flows of consolidated investment products do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted the discussion that follows the table will focus on the company’s cash flows as presented in the “before consolidation” column of the table 

condensed consolidating statements of cash flows 

cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows

operating activities 

operating cash flows are generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities although some receipts and payments are seasonal particularly bonus payments in general after allowing for the change in cash held by consolidated investment products our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income 

in 2010 cash generated by operating activities increased 165 million to 3792 million from 3627 million in 2009 as shown in the tables above consolidated investment products used 2220 million of cash in operating activities in 2010 compared to contributing 369 million in 2009 the sum of the operating investing and financing cash flows of consolidated investment products offsets to a zero impact to the company’s change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period excluding the impact of consolidated investment products cash generated by operations was 6012 million in 2010 compared to 3258 million in 2009 

the generation of 6012 million of cash from operations in 2010 included

after excluding the net purchase of trading investments cash generated from other operating activities in 2010 improved by 3070 million from 3546 million in 2009 to 6616 million in 2010 this reflects the improved operating income together with the timing differences on staff bonus and other staff compensation related payments 

the 352 reduction in operating income for the year ended december 31 2009 when compared to 2008 is a significant factor in the yearonyear reduced operating cash flows after excluding the impact of consolidated investment products cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was 3258 million a decrease of 2500 million or 434 over 2008 the timing of the funding of annual bonuses combined with the lower levels of accrued bonus awards at the end of 2009 contributed to operating cash falling by a greater percentage than operating income

we have received credit ratings of a3stable and astable from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k according to moody’s obligations rated ‘a’ are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk invesco’s rating of a3 is at the low end of the a range a1 a2 a3 but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of baa3 standard and poor’s rating of a is at the lower end of the a rating with bbb representing standard and poor’s lowest investment grade rating according to standard and poor’s a obligations exhibit a strong capacity to meet financial commitments but are somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our revenues are somewhat exposed to equity market volatility negative tangible equity potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry and integration risk related to the acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings however management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt these credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by moody’s or standard  poor’s each rating should be evaluated independently 

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company’s liquidity and capital resources the executive overview of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a broader discussion of the company’s overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the company’s liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions however we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 13157 million in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

the company has transactions with various private equity real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business many of the company’s investment products are structured as limited partnerships the company’s investment may take the form of the general partner or a limited partner and the entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified at december 31 2010 the company’s undrawn capital commitments were 1364 million december 31 2009 776 million 

the volatility and valuation dislocations that have occurred from 2007 to the date of this report in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated pricing issues in many areas of the market as a result of these valuation dislocations during the fourth quarter of 2007 invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure these two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to strictly limited types of investors in december 2010 the agreements were amended to extend the term through june 30 2011 further extensions are likely as of december 31 2010 the total committed support under these agreements was 360 million with an internal approval mechanism to increase the maximum possible support to 660 million at the option of the company the estimated value of these agreements at december 31 2010 was 20 million december 31 2009 25 million which was recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the estimated value of these agreements is lower than the maximum support amount reflecting management’s estimation that the likelihood of funding under the support agreements is low significant investor redemptions out of the trusts before the scheduled maturity of the underlying securities or significant credit default issues of the securities held within the trusts’ portfolios could change the company’s estimation of likelihood of funding no payment has been made under either agreement nor has invesco realized any loss from the support agreements through the date of this report these trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 “accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

  taxation we operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

as a multinational corporation the company operates in various locations around the world and we generate substantially all of our earnings from our subsidiaries under asc 74030 deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company’s subsidiaries consolidated investment products and joint ventures except where it is our intention to and we continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings our canadian and us subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by invesco holding company limited formerly invesco plc our predecessor company which is directly owned by invesco ltd our canadian unremitted earnings for which we are indefinitely reinvested are estimated to be 1131 million at december 31 2010 compared with 1016 million at december 31 2009 if distributed as a dividend canadian withholding tax of 50 would be due dividends from our investment in the us should not give rise to additional tax as we are not subject to withholding tax between the us and uk deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 31 million 2009 23 million for additional tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future there is no additional tax on dividends from the uk to bermuda 

net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the us uk and canada based on management’s belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

  goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the first step of the goodwill impairment test then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the company’s annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year as a result of that analysis the company determined that no impairment existed at that date our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2010 and 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary 

we have determined that we have one operating and reportable segment the company evaluated the components of its business which are business units one level below the operating segment level and has determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the company’s components include invesco institutional invesco north american retail invesco perpetual invesco continental europe and invesco asia pacific the company’s operating segment represents one reporting unit because all of the components are similar due to the common nature of products and services offered type of clients methods of distribution manner in which each component is operated extent to which they share assets and resources and the extent to which they support and benefit from common product development efforts traditional profit and loss measures are not produced and therefore not reviewed by component management for any of the components furthermore the financial information that is available by component is not sufficient for purposes of performing a discounted cash flow analysis at the component level in order to test goodwill for impairment at that level as none of our components are reporting units we have determined that our single operating segment investment management is also our single reporting unit 

the principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows recent results and projections based on expectation regarding revenues expenses capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the present value produced for the reporting unit is the fair value of the reporting unit this amount is reconciled to the company’s market capitalization to determine an implied control premium which is compared to an analysis of historical control premiums experienced by peer companies over a long period of time to assess the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit 

the company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary and corroborative fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature scope and size the results of the secondary market approach to provide a fair value estimate are not combined or weighted with the results of the income approach described above but are used to provide an additional basis to determine the reasonableness of the income approach fair value estimate 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 69802 million and 64676 million at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s assets under management or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees 

due to deteriorating market conditions interim impairment tests were performed at october 31 2008 and march 31 2009 using the most recently available operating information these interim tests also concluded that no impairment had occurred following the march 31 2009 interim test the general market conditions improved and the company did not identify the need for further interim tests during 2009 as no indicators of impairment existed the march 31 2009 interim impairment test adopted an income approach consistent with the annual 2008 impairment tests but utilized the company’s updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenues and expenses the primary assumption changes from the october 31 2008 valuation test were increases in the anticipated rise in equity markets in the nearterm and in net aum sales the increase in equity markets was based on an analysis of the dow jones industrial average for 10 recession events between 1945 and 2001 the october 31 2008 valuation had assumed an equity market rise inline with more normal nonrecessionary experience the higher aum net sales reflects new flows into the equity markets as values stabilize and confidence returns and also took into account the company’s improved relative investment performance a discount rate of 137 was used for the march 31 2009 test similar to the october 31 2008 rate of 136 october 1 2008 116 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates 

the october 1 2009 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the march 31 2009 interim impairment test with the exception that adjustments were made to remove the nearterm equity market rise assumption since much of the market rebound had been experienced in the period between march 31 2009 and october 1 2009 a discount rate of 129 was used for the october 1 2009 analysis a 40 decline in the fair value of our reporting unit or a 500 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our october 1 2009 goodwill impairment analysis would have caused the carrying value of our reporting unit to be in excess of its fair value which would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to be performed which would have required a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill 

the october 1 2010 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2009 annual impairment test with assumptions updated for current market conditions the most significant change in assumptions from 2009 related to an increase in the market risk premium which resulted in a discount rate of 149 for the october 1 2010 analysis a 43 decline in market value or a 700 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our october 1 2010 goodwill impairment analysis would be required to cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the market value thus triggering step two of the goodwill impairment test the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill 

  intangible assets intangible assets identified on the acquisition of a business are capitalized separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition transaction date and if they are determined to be finitelived are amortized and recorded as operating expenses on a straightline basis over their useful lives from two to 12 years which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized the company considers its own assumptions which require management’s judgment about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement consistent with its expected use of the asset a change in the useful life of an intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense 

where evidence exists that the underlying management contracts have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis the company reevaluates the useful life determination for intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life or an indication of impairment the indicators in asc topic 35030 paragraphs 3523 and 24 were considered in making the determination that the indefinitelived intangibles that arose from the june 1 2010 acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business comprise one unit of account for impairment testing purposes none of the indicators were considered presumptive or determinative however due to the fact that the retail fund management contracts are managed under invesco’s single retail branding strategy and are used by various business components within the organization the single unit of account was deemed appropriate 

definitelived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable ie carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment including discount rates revenue multiples and aum growth rates changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions 

  investments most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market using quoted close or bid prices as of each reporting period end when a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values of our 4732 million total investments at december 31 2010 those most susceptible to impairment include 995 million seed money investments in our affiliated funds seed money investments are investments held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one three and fiveyear historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets we also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

  consolidated investment products the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies consolidate the vies a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests the company provides investment management services to and has transactions with various private equity funds real estate funds fundoffunds clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business the company serves as the investment manager making daytoday investment decisions concerning the assets of the products certain of these entities are considered to be vies 

for all investment funds with the exception of clos if the company is deemed to have a variable interest in these entities the company is deemed to be the fund’s primary beneficiary if the company has the majority of rewardsrisks of ownership for clos if the company is deemed to have a variable interest in these entities the company is deemed to be the fund’s primary beneficiary if it has the power to direct the activities of the clo that most significantly impact the clo’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb lossesright to receive benefits from the clo that could potentially be significant to the clo 

assessing if an entity is a vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the company’s contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are vies additionally certain investment products are voes and are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kickout liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners these investment products are also consolidated into the company’s financial statements 

determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns for investment products other than clos involves estimation and probability assumptions for clos there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly effect the clos economic results and to assess if the company’s interests could be deemed significant if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products net and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities net amounts on the consolidated statements of income

 item 1 business 

introduction 

invesco is a leading independent global investment management company dedicated to helping people worldwide build their financial security by delivering the combined power of our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities invesco provides a comprehensive array of enduring investment products for retail institutional and highnetworth clients around the world operating in 20 countries invesco had 4231 billion in assets under management aum as of december 31 2009 

the key drivers of success for invesco are longterm investment performance and client service delivered across a diverse spectrum of investment management capabilities distribution channels geographic areas and market exposures by achieving success in these areas we seek to generate positive net flows increased aum and associated revenues we are affected significantly by market movements which are beyond our control however we endeavor to mitigate the impact of market movement by offering broad investment capability client and geographical diversification we measure relative investment performance by comparing our investment capabilities to competing products industry benchmarks and client investment objectives generally distributors investment advisors and consultants take into consideration longerterm investment performance eg threeyear and fiveyear performance in their selection of investment product and manager recommendations to their customers although shorterterm performance may also be an important consideration thirdparty ratings may also have an influence on client investment decisions quality of client service is monitored in a variety of ways including periodic client satisfaction surveys analysis of response times and redemption rates competitive benchmarking of services and feedback from investment consultants 

invesco ltd is organized under the laws of bermuda and our common shares are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ivz” we maintain a web site at wwwinvescocom information contained on our web site shall not be deemed to be part of or to be incorporated into this document 

strategy 

the company focuses on four key strategic priorities that are designed to further strengthen our business and help ensure our longterm success 

 

 

 

 

over the past four years invesco has taken a number of steps to leverage the individual strengths of our distinct investment centers and present the organization as a single firm to our clients around the world we believe these changes have strengthened invesco’s ability to operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization 

since we take a unified approach to our business we are presenting our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “asset management” 

recent developments 

the global economic recession the general weakening of government agency and corporate credit the dissolution and strategic redirection of certain large financial institutions and the market volatility over the past two years has had a significant impact on our industry these factors among others created a unique competitive opportunity for few investment management firms that were able to deliver superior relative investment performance maintain their corporate financial strength and remain intensely focused on their clients we believe invesco was one of these few firms that was able to emerge from this challenging economic and market environment in an improved competitive position 

several investment credit and liquidity issues affected many key competitors within the asset management industry including significant economic and reputational exposure to assetbacked securities illiquid credit derivatives structured investment vehicles sivs auction rate preferred shares hedge funds that were effectively operating as ponzi schemes and securities lending programs that lost value invesco had little to no exposure to such factors furthermore while some competitors were withdrawing from the marketplace we were meeting regularly with clients helping them navigate the difficult markets and sharing solutions to meet their longterm investment needs that enhanced visibility allowed us to deepen our existing relationships and foster new ones putting us in a strong position as clients began returning to the markets 

invesco’s commitment to our multiyear strategy set a firm foundation for the company’s many achievements during 2009 including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together these efforts resulted in positive net flows for our business in each quarter of 2009 at the same time reflecting the decline in global markets and resulting decline in the company’s assets under management operating margin and net operating margin decreased to 184 and 259 in 2009 respectively from 226 and 316 in 2008 respectively see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income — and by calculation a reconciliation of operating margin to net operating margin — and important additional disclosures 

we continued to execute on our longterm strategy making disciplined capital and resource allocation decisions in a challenging environment which we believe further improved our ability to serve our clients reinforced our reputation as one of the premiere global asset managers and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins as we progressed through the year in addition we took steps to further strengthen our financial position and augment our capital flexibility through a successful capital raise and a new credit facility we retain a positive outlook by sp and stable outlook with moody’s 

perhaps the most visible of our accomplishments in 2009 was our announcement in october that we are acquiring morgan stanley’s retail asset management business including van kampen the combination of our organizations has tremendous implications for invesco’s business when the transaction closes in mid2010 through this transaction we expect to expand the depth and breadth of our investment strategies strengthen our overall distribution capabilities and greatly enhance our ability to serve clients both in the us and globally the planned acquisition provided invesco the opportunity to review its overall branding approach in the us under the new approach beginning april 30 2010 invesco aim will be rebranded as invesco and aim funds will be rebranded with the invesco name eg aim charter fund will become invesco charter fund in addition after the close of the transaction invesco will be added to the van kampen openend fund names eg van kampen comstock fund will become invesco van kampen comstock fund and invesco will rebrand the morgan stanley products that are included in the transaction eg morgan stanley special value fund will become invesco special value fund 

certain demographic and industry trends 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and our business 

 

 

 

 

our four strategic priorities and our plans for taking the business forward acknowledge these demographic and economic trends as we work to further strengthen our competitive position our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and ensure our longterm success 

investment management capabilities 

invesco is a leading independent global investment manager with operations in 20 countries as of december 31 2009 invesco managed 4231 billion in assets for retail institutional and highnetworth investors around the world by delivering the combined power of our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities invesco provides a comprehensive array of enduring solutions for our clients

competition 

the investment management business is highly competitive with points of differentiation including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength the depth and continuity of relationships quality of service and the level of fees charged for services we compete with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks broker dealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions we believe that the diversity of our investment styles product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business we also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both distribute investment products and manage investment products lastly we believe continued execution against our multiyear strategy will further strengthen our longterm competitive position 

management contracts 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients and funds fees vary with the type of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income money market and stable value accounts investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days’ notice typically retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional and private wealth management clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very shortnotice periods

 item 1a risk factors 

recent volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy have negatively affected invesco’s revenues and may continue to do so 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing substantial volatility and disruption for over a year while these disruptions moderated to some extent following the march 2009 lows in equity markets historical norms have not returned and the potential for extreme disruptions remains these market events have materially impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so and could materially impact our financial condition and liquidity in this regard 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match further significant deterioration in global financial markets 

in response to significant reductions in our assets under management related to recent adverse changes in world financial markets we have undertaken a variety of efforts to achieve cost savings and reduce our overall operating expenses if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our revenues would be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under our management as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management assets under management may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain relatively fixed factors that could decrease assets under management and therefore revenues include the following 

  declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated approximately 41 of our total assets under management were invested in equity securities and approximately 59 were invested in fixed income and other securities at december 31 2009 through the date of the filing of the annual report on form 10k with the sec markets continue to be volatile our aum as of january 31 2010 was 4126 billion we cannot predict whether the continued volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our assets under management are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

  redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional or individual accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts therefore our revenues may decline if clients shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

  declines in the value of seed capital and partnership investments the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed investments as of december 31 2009 the company had 1518 million in seed capital and partnership investments 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days’ notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the 

event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund’s board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the board of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts of invesco or our subsidiaries generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under our management and individual clients may elect to close their accounts redeem their shares in our funds or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or assets under management would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

in a risingrate environment certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its net asset value although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining net asset value some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have 179 million of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries and any adverse changes in the regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict business activities possible sanctions include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities after redomicile and after consultation with the uk financial services authority fsa it has been determined that for the purposes of prudential supervision invesco ltd is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current european union eu directives a subgroup however including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to these consolidated capital requirements and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2009 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 3335 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company invesco ltd we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes could impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

various regulators legislators other government officials and other public policy commentators have proposed or are considering proposals for regulatory reform in response to the ongoing crisis in the financial markets certain proposals are far reaching and if enacted could have a material impact on invesco’s business while many of these proposals are designed to address perceived problems in the banking sector certain of the proposals could be applied to other financial services companies including asset managers potential developments include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain proposals would require national legislation or international treaties invesco cannot at this time predict the impact of potential regulatory changes on its business it is possible such changes could impose material new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invesco’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity moreover such changes could require us to modify our strategies businesses or operations and we may incur other new constraints or costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and revenues might be adversely affected 

civil litigation and governmental enforcement actions and investigations could adversely affect our assets under management and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

the us supreme court is expected to reach a decision in the case of jones v harris during its current term which is scheduled to end in june 2010 that case involves the interpretation of section 36b of the investment company act of 1940 as amended section 36b grants private parties the right to sue to challenge fees paid by mutual funds to their investment advisers depending on the nature and scope of the court’s ruling the mutual fund industry in the us could face additional litigation defense costs new compliance costs and additional pressure on mutual fund fees 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and the resulting good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries material errors in public reports employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed further our business requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage conflicts of interest but this task is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail — or appear to fail — to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

many of the asset management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify guidelines or contractual requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and net income to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations 

  competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

in 2009 we saw several instances of industry consolidation both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future particularly if the economic environment and the financial markets remain uncertain and volatile the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain 

direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

as part of our business strategy we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements 

on october 19 2009 we announced that the company had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire morgan stanley’s retail asset management business including van kampen investments the transaction was valued at 15 billion subject to adjustment consisting of payments by invesco of 5000 million in cash for which we expect to use available cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and an aggregate of approximately 441 million invesco common shares and nonvoting common equivalent preferred shares which will result in morgan stanley obtaining an approximately 93 equity interest in our company the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in mid2010 subject to customary regulatory client and fund shareholder approvals as a result of this transaction and until the time of the deal closing contractual limitations are in place with respect to our issuing or repurchasing our common shares other than those related to employee compensation plans and we are also unable to declare or pay any extraordinary dividends 

the aggregate amount of approximately 441 million invesco common shares and nonvoting common equivalent preferred shares with economic rights identical to common stock other than no right to vote such shares that we expect to issue to morgan stanley in exchange for their asset management business upon closing the transaction are largely unrestricted since no “lock up” exists morgan stanley may sell these shares in the open market or through a secondary offering subject to certain limited restrictions if morgan stanley were to sell their future equity stake in invesco or express an intention to sell the stake after the close this may have a significant impact on the company’s stock price 

acquisitions including the pending acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to closing or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

our access to the capital markets including for purposes of financing potential acquisitions depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3 and bbb from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k standard  poor’s has a “positive” outlook for the rating and moody’s has a “stable” outlook for the rating as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels product type and geographies our level of indebtedness our risk appetite and approach to risk management our ability to maintain consistent positive investment the profitability of our business under a sustained downturn scenario and integration risk related to the pending acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire asset management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit rating or outlook thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing or receive mandates management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

a reduction in our long or shortterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues the continuing current levels of unprecedented volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position 

as of december 31 2009 we had outstanding total debt of 7457 million and shareholders’ equity of 69129 million the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios as well as maintaining a minimum amount of longterm assets under management this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our longterm assets under management or our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 

we sell a portion of our investment products through a variety of financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and financial organizations in europe and asia increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues as a result of recent market turmoil there has been some consolidation of banks and brokerdealers particularly in the us and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice if these trends continue our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated additionally particularly outside of the us certain of the intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products increasingly investors particularly in the institutional market rely on external consultants and other unconflicted third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular client’s needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future additionally if one of our major distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability moreover any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients’ data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and investors in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success in recent periods illiquid markets for certain types of securities have required increased use of fair 

value pricing which is dependent on certain subjective judgments any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty vendors these systems could suffer deficiencies failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to regularly assess and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our assets under management is presently derived from the united states however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill on our balance sheet that is subject to an annual impairment review goodwill totaled 64676 million at december 31 2009 2008 59668 million we may not realize the value of such goodwill we perform impairment reviews of the book values of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies — goodwill” for additional details of the company’s goodwill impairment analysis process 

implementation of new accounting rules in our consolidated financial statements could result in investor confusion or potential deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” fasb statement no 167 now encompassed in accounting standards codification topic 810 “consolidation” fasb statement no 167 is effective january 1 2010 and its adoption will be reflected in our first quarter 2010 form 10q the adoption of fasb statement no 167 will have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial statements as it will require us to consolidate for the first time certain collateralized loan and debt obligation products clos with approximately 6 billion in aum at december 31 2009 into our financial statements as a result the company’s consolidated statement of income will reflect the elimination of management and performance fees earned from these clos in addition fasb statement no 167 will require that our consolidated balance sheet reflect the collateral assets held and nonrecourse debt issued by these clos despite the fact that the 

assets cannot be used by the company nor is the company obligated for the debt in addition the new rules will require our consolidated cash flow statement to reflect the cash flows of the clos the adoption of fasb statement no 167 in the company’s financial statements could have an impact on users’ analyses of our underlying results of operations financial position or liquidity as a result external credit rating agencies or analysts could report information not reflective of the underlying financial condition of the company 

deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting could result as the financial information of the funds required to be consolidated do not form part of the company’s financial reporting systems and processes 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda “companies act” the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances directors and officers may owe duties to a company’s creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

our byelaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries’ income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances

 item 3 legal proceedings 

following the industrywide regulatory investigations in 2003 and 2004 multiple lawsuits based on market timing allegations were filed against various parties affiliated with invesco these lawsuits were consolidated in the united states district court for the district of maryland together with market timing lawsuits brought against affiliates of other mutual fund companies and on september 29 2004 three amended complaints were filed against companyaffiliated parties 1 a putative shareholder class action complaint brought on behalf of shareholders of aim funds formerly advised by invesco funds group inc 2 a derivative complaint purportedly brought on behalf of certain aim funds and the shareholders of such funds and 3 an erisa complaint purportedly brought on behalf of participants in the company’s 401k plan the company and plaintiffs have reached settlements in principle of these lawsuits the proposed settlements which are subject to court approval call for a payment by the company of 98 million recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income in 2007 in exchange for dismissal with prejudice of all pending claims in addition under the terms of the proposed settlements the company may incur certain costs in connection with providing notice of the proposed settlements to affected shareholders based on information currently available it is not believed that any such incremental notice costs will have any material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 

the asset management industry also is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the united states and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the us and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate any material loss of investor andor client confidence as a result of such inquiries andor litigation could result in a significant decline in assets under management which would have an adverse effect on the company’s future financial results and its ability to grow its business 

in the normal course of its business the company is subject to various litigation matters although there can be no assurances at this time management believes based on information currently available to it that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

although the global equity markets began to recover after the first quarter of 2009 they began the year under extreme pressure as illustrated in the table below it is important to note that the markets remain below their historical highs with the sp down 2573 from october 2007 to january 2010 

in expectation of volatile financial markets invesco senior leadership adopted a disciplined approach to our business beginning in 2008 a key component of this approach was to significantly reduce discretionary spending freeing resources which enabled the company to reinvest in opportunities that would strengthen our business over the long term and enhance our competitive position this approach served the company well over the past two years — during which the dow jones industrial average saw its worst year of performance since 1931 in 2008 and other markets around the globe suffered significant declines as well 

after bottoming out in march 2009 global financial markets staged a dramatic recovery with several major global market indices rebounding in record fashion off of record declines in 2008 the response from governments and central banks around the world to the financial crisis in 2008 was an unprecedented amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus central banks lowered interest rates to near zero issued a number of debt guarantees for banks and other nonbank financial institutions and began to increase the supply of money through open market asset purchases additionally governments around the globe passed legislation that poured billions of dollars into the global economy these actions alleviated the risk aversion that dominated the latter half of 2008 and as a result financial markets rallied in 2009 the dow jones industrial average climbed 538 off of march lows to finish the year up 226 the nasdaq composite index rebounded 789 above its march low to return 452 for the full year the ftse 100 gained 221 in 2009 its largest advance since 1997 the largest returns were found in the emerging markets as the msci emerging market index returned 790 for the year 

the dramatic easing of monetary policy also contributed to major improvements in the credit markets as interest rates remained close to zero investors fled the relative safety of us treasury securities for riskier asset classes such as investment grade high yield and emerging market bonds in search of yield credit spreads tightened to levels not seen since the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in september 2008 providing corporations around the world access to capital markets additionally the us dollar weakened from march until december as investors redeployed from the relative safety of us treasury securities into nonus investments 

in spite of the difficult operating environment over the past year invesco continued to make progress in a number of areas that further positioned our company for a time when the markets return throughout the course of 2009 the company’s financial performance strengthened in addition during this period invesco continued to strengthen its competitive position with respect to investment performance maintain its focus on its clients and enhance its profile in the industry 

a critical factor in invesco’s ability to weather the economic storms of the past two years was our integrated approach to risk management our risk management framework provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up down and across the company our global performance measurement and risk group provides senior management and the board with insight into core investment risks while our corporate risk management committee facilitates a focus on strategic operational and all other business risks further a network of business unit functional and geographic risk management committees maintains an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottomup perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business through this regular and consistent risk communication the board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a riskaware culture in which good risk management is built into the fabric of the business 

in addition we benefited from having a diversified asset base one of invesco’s core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles asset classes and distribution channels our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world invesco is also diversified by asset class with 41 of our assets under management in equities and the remaining 59 covering the risk spectrum from alternatives to money market invesco’s assets are roughly split between retail and institutional and the private wealth management channel provides further diversification this broad diversification enables invesco to weather different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 

a significant portion of our business and assets under management aum is based outside of the us the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling and the canadian dollar will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from most global capital markets increased in the three months and year ended december 31 2009 which also contributed to net increases in aum of 62 billion and 659 billion during the respective periods aum at january 31 2010 was 4126 billion 

summary operating information for 2009 and 2008 is presented in the table below

 results of operations 

results of operations for the year ended december 31 2009 compared with the year ended december 31 2008 

operating revenues and net revenues 

operating revenues decreased by 206 in 2009 to 26273 million 2008 33076 million net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements net revenues decreased by 205 in 2009 to 19787 million 2008 24894 million see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates over the course of the year the average us dollar foreign exchange rate was stronger when compared to other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar and euro which impacted our reported revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the impact of foreign exchange rate movements resulted in 1520 million 223 of the decline in operating revenues during the year ended december 31 2009 additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum as more fully discussed below movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period 

the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 

 

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees decreased 190 in 2009 to 21202 million 2008 26178 million due to decreases in average aum during the year changes in the mix of aum between various asset classes and foreign exchange rate movements average aum for the year ended december 31 2009 were 3887 billion 2008 4406 billion a decrease of 118 average longterm aum which generally earn higher fee rates than institutional money market aum for the year ended december 31 2009 were 3017 billion a decrease of 164 from 3608 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 while average institutional money market aum increased 90 to 870 billion at december 31 2009 from 798 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees can include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

in 2009 service and distribution fees decreased 195 to 4126 million 2008 5125 million primarily due to decreases in average aum during the year included in the decline in service and distribution fees in the three months ended december 31 2009 was a reduction of 54 million reflecting the fullyear impact of a reduction in transfer agency and administrative revenues in canada as certain fund expense recovery limits were reached 

performance fees 

performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with method 1 of asc topic 60520s99 “revenue recognition — services — sec materials” cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect and therefore we have performance fee arrangements that include monthly quarterly and annual measurement dates given the uniqueness of each transaction performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies if performance 

arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance additionally of our 4231 billion in aum at december 31 2009 only approximately 300 billion or 71 could potentially earn performance fees 

in 2009 performance fees decreased 601 to 300 million 2008 751 million the performance fees generated in 2009 arose primarily due to products managed by the invesco global strategies group 24 million invesco perpetual 134 million and atlantic trust 57 million the performance fees generated in 2008 arose primarily due to products managed by the invesco global strategies 223 million and real estate 145 million groups as well as by invesco perpetual 211 million 

other revenues 

other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds these transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products 

in 2009 other revenues decreased 369 to 645 million 2008 1022 million driven by decreases in transaction commissions due to the tightening of the credit markets and fewer real estate transactions and foreign exchange rate movements 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include periodic “renewal” commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients’ assets over the time they are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution service and advisory expenses for the uk and canada where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues as noted above 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses decreased 208 in 2009 to 6934 million 2008 8755 million consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement is our 490 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture 

the 218 decrease in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses to 448 million in 2009 2008 573 million is driven by the declines in average aum of the invesco great wall joint venture our share of the invesco great wall joint venture’s average aum at december 31 2009 was 37 billion a 178 decline in average aum from 45 billion at december 31 2008 

operating expenses 

during 2009 operating expenses decreased 163 to 21430 million 2008 25598 million reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2008 expense levels as discussed above a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into us dollars the reporting currency of the company using average foreign exchange rates over the course of the year the average us dollar foreign exchange rate was stronger when compared to other currencies primarily the pound sterling canadian dollar and euro which impacted our reported expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the impact of foreign exchange rate movements resulted in 1080 million 259 of the decline in operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 additionally operating expenses were lower in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting the impact of general cost containment measures and costs that move in line with revenues 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 

 

the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense 

 

employee compensation 

employee compensation includes salary cash bonuses and sharebased payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation 

employee compensation decreased 1050 million or 99 in 2009 from 2008 due predominantly to overall decreases in variable compensation including decreases in discretionary and investment performancebased staff bonuses decreases in base salary costs resulting from decreases in headcount and foreign exchange rate movements headcount declined 82 to 4890 at december 31 2009 from 5325 at december 31 2008 included in compensation expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 are sharebased payment costs of 908 million compared to 977 million during the year ended december 31 2008 additionally employee compensation costs for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 included 200 million of prepaid compensation amortization expenses related to the 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co this expense amortization will continue through 2010 and the acquisitionrelated asset will be fully amortized by the third quarter of 2011

marketing expenses decreased 265 in 2009 to 1089 million 2008 1482 million due to decreased marketing support payments related to the decline in average aum in the us a lower level of advertising and a reduction in marketingrelated travel costs 

property office and technology 

property office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities depreciation of companyowned property and capitalized computer equipment costs minor noncapitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments and costs related to externally provided operations technology and other back office management services 

property office and technology costs decreased 09 to 2123 million in 2009 from 2143 million in 2008 decreases in technology costs resulting from general disciplined expense management measures and foreign exchange rate movement were offset by increases in property and office costs during the year property and office expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 included 120 million in charges relating to vacating leased property including our denver colorado operations facility property and office expenses during 2008 included a 51 million rent charge related to vacating leased property offset by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of 82 million property office and technology costs increased in the three months ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the outsourcing of facilities management in north america and the significant growth of the hyderabad india facility 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses include professional services costs such as information service subscriptions consulting fees professional insurance costs audit tax and legal fees nonmarketing related employee travel expenditures recruitment and training costs and the amortization of certain intangible assets 

general and administrative expenses decreased by 992 million 373 to 1668 million in 2009 from 2660 million in 2008 due to several factors including an insurance recovery of 95 million related to legal costs associated with the markettiming regulatory settlement foreign exchange rate movement and general disciplined expense management measures including reduced travel and entertainment and professional services expenses recorded during the year ended december 31 2009

operating income net operating income operating margin and net operating margin 

operating income decreased 352 to 4843 million in 2009 from 7478 million in 2008 driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced aum as a result of the decline in our operating revenues the following measures have also declined in 2009 operating margin net operating income and net operating margin operating margin operating income divided by operating revenues was 184 in 2009 down from 226 in 2008 net operating income operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements decreased 349 to 5127 million in 2009 from 7875 million in 2008 net operating margin was 259 in 2009 down from 316 in 2008 net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues net revenues are equal to operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues net operating income and net operating margins 

other income and expenses 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 198 million 423 to 270 million in the year ended december 31 2009 december 31 2008 468 million resulting primarily from declines in our share of the pretax earnings of our joint venture investments in china as well as net losses in certain of our partnership investments 

interest income decreased 737 to 98 million in 2009 from 372 million in 2008 due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2009 the decrease in yields was consistent with the market movement from 2008 to 2009 interest expense decreased 161 to 645 million in 2009 from 769 million in 2008 due to decreases in the average debt balance in 2009 

other gains and losses net were a net gain of 78 million in 2009 compared to a net loss of 399 million in 2008 included in the net gain is a gross gain generated upon the debt tender offer of 43 million 33 million net of related expenses and net gain of 43 million realized upon the disposal of other investments 2008 74 million gain on maturity of a clo investment offset by a loss of 41 million realized upon the disposal of a private equity investment the 2009 net gain also included 52 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our clo products 2008 227 million and 30 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds 2008 85 million the clo impairments arose principally from adverse changes in the timing of estimated cash flows used in the valuation models in the year ended december 31 2009 we also benefited from 84 million in net foreign exchange gains whereas in 2008 we incurred 130 million in net foreign exchange losses see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 13 other gains and losses net” for additional details related to other gains and losses 

included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products in 2009 the net losses of consolidated investment products were 1069 million compared to net losses of 580 million in 2008 reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products invesco invests in only a small equity portion of these products and as a result these losses are offset by noncontrolling interests of 1139 million resulting in a net impact to the company of 70 million 

income tax expense 

our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world each with its own statutory income tax rate as a result our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries the majority of our profits are earned in the us canada and the uk the current uk statutory tax rate is 28 the canadian statutory tax rate is 33 and the us federal statutory tax rate is 35 

our effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for 2009 was 315 down from 329 for 2008 the rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pretax income and a larger benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2009 versus 2008 the rate decrease was partially offset by an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and additional state taxes 

the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate to 415 in 2009 and to 359 in 2008

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses decreased 167 in 2008 to 8755 million 2007 10511 million consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments 

the 54 decrease in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses to 573 million in 2008 2007 606 million is driven by the declines in average aum in the invesco great wall joint venture our share of the invesco great wall joint venture’s aum at december 31 2008 was 30 billion a 58 decline in aum from 71 billion at december 31 2007 reflecting the increased volatility of equity markets in this region during the year 

operating expenses 

during 2008 operating expenses decreased 113 to 25598 million 2007 28846 million reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2007 expense levels 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 

 

the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense 

 

employee compensation 

employee compensation decreased 818 million or 72 in 2008 from 2007 due predominantly to overall decreases in sales commissions and variable compensation offsetting these declines were increases in base salary expenses resulting from annual merit increases which were effective march 1 2008 additionally in the three months ended december 31 2008 the company experienced increases in bonus expense tied to improved investment performance and performance fee revenues these increases in bonus expense during the three months ended december 31 2008 which incorporated recognition of a full year impact tied to investment performance improvements were equally offset in the three months ended december 31 2008 by the reversal of 188 million 126 million net of tax or 05 per share of cumulative sharebased compensation charges related to performancebased share awards granted in 2007 the reversal was made because the company does not expect that the required performance targets for the vesting of these awards will be achieved of the charges reversed 108 million was originally recorded in 2007 with the remainder originally recorded in the first nine months of 2008 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section 

marketing 

marketing expenses decreased 60 in 2008 to 1482 million 2007 1576 million due to decreased marketing support payments related to decreased sales and aum in the us consistent with overall market declines during the period 

property office and technology 

property office and technology costs decreased 116 to 2143 million in 2008 from 2425 million in 2007 due primarily to reduced depreciation charges reflecting longer useful lives for certain global technology initiatives during the three months ended december 31 2008 charges of 51 million were recorded related to vacating leased property however these charges were offset during the year by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of 82 million rent expense during the year ended december 31 2007 included a 74 million charge related to vacating leased property 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses decreased by 298 million 101 to 2660 million in 2008 from 2958 million in 2007 during the three months ended december 31 2007 we recorded 128 million of expense related to the relisting of the company on the new york stock exchange and a 98 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of markettiming private litigation that commenced in 2003 

operating income net operating income operating margin and net operating margin 

operating income decreased 248 to 7478 million in 2008 from 9943 million in 2007 driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced aum operating margin operating income divided by operating revenues was 226 in 2008 down from 256 in 2007 net operating income operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements decreased 243 to 7875 million in 2008 from 10398 million in 2007 net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues net revenues are equal to operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements net operating margin was 316 in 2008 down from 360 in 2007 see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues net operating income and net operating margins 

other income and expenses 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 13 million 27 to 468 million in the year ended december 31 2008 december 31 2007 481 million resulting primarily from declines in our share of the pretax losses of our partnership investments 

interest income decreased 233 to 372 million in 2008 from 485 million in 2007 due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2008 the decrease in yields was consistent with the market movement from 2007 to 2008 interest expense increased 79 to 769 million in 2008 from 713 million in 2007 due to increases in the average debt balance in 2008 which were only partially offset by lower debt costs in 2008 

other gains and losses net were a net loss of 399 million in 2008 compared to a net gain of 99 million in 2007 the 2008 net loss included 227 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our clo products 2007 54 million and 85 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds 2007 0 million the impairment of the clo products arose principally from increases in discount rates and extended cash flow projections used in the valuation models and the impairment of the seed money arose principally due to extended declines in market values of the underlying funds 142 million of the combined impairment charges arose during the three months ended december 31 2008 

included in other gains and losses net are net gains on disposals of investments of 43 million in 2008 2007 240 million primarily driven by a gain of 74 realized upon the maturity of a clo product in which the company had invested also included in other losses are net foreign exchange losses primarily associated with longterm intercompany financing in the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 130 million in net foreign exchange losses 2007 103 million largely the result of the weakening of the pound sterling to the euro and us dollar in the three months ended december 31 2008 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 13 other gains and losses net” for additional details related to other gains and losses 

included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products in 2008 the net losses of consolidated investment products were 580 million compared to net gains of 2143 million in 2007 reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the deconsolidation of certain variable 

interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary invesco invests in a small equity portion of these products and as a result the majority of these gains and losses are offset by noncontrolling interests 

income tax expense 

the 2008 uk statutory tax rate was 280 the canadian statutory tax rate was 335 and the us federal statutory tax rate was 350 

the uk’s tax rate decreased from 30 to 280 effective april 1 2008 on december 14 2007 legislation was enacted to reduce the canadian income tax rate over five years which changed the tax rate to 335 in 2008 and 330 in 2009 the legislation was revised in december 2009 further reducing the rate to 310 in 2010 2825 in 2011 and 2625 in 2012 

our effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for 2008 was 329 as compared to 346 in 2007 the decrease related primarily to a net reduction in our reserves lower state taxes and reduced taxes on subsidiary dividends in excess of an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and certain investment writedowns that did not give rise to tax benefits our effective tax rate after noncontrolling interests increased to 529 for the three months ended december 31 2008 largely as a result of the investment writedowns 2007 included a reduction in our canadian and uk deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes 

the inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests increased our effective tax rate to 359 in 2008 and reduced it to 287 in 2007 

schedule of nongaap information 

net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum net operating income and net operating margin are nongaap financial measures the most comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues and by calculation gross revenue yield on aum operating income and operating margin management believes that the exclusion of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of the company’s managed funds which essentially are a share of the related revenues these expenses vary by geography due to the differences in distribution channels the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business removing the distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and assisting in comparison with us peer investment managers thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients’ assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value third party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the thirdparty arrangements the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under us gaap we believe that it is useful information to investors to show these expenses net of operating revenues because net presentation more appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenuesharing activities additionally management evaluates net revenue yield on aum which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period this metric is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors 

management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide useful information to investors as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint venture to the operations of the business the company has two joint venture investments in china the invesco great wall joint venture was one of the largest sinoforeign managers of equity products in china with ending aum of approximately 8 billion as of december 31 2009 enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time accordingly we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business 

net revenues and by calculation net revenue yield on aum net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the company will be expanding its use of nongaap measures in future filings beginning with the form 10q for the three months ended march 31 2010 to include reconciling items relating to fasb statement no 167 discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” and in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” and the acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business 

the following is a reconciliation of operating revenues operating income and operating margin on a us gaap basis to net revenues net operating income and net operating margin 

 

 

 balance sheet discussion 

the following table presents a comparative analysis of significant balance sheet line items 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents increased from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 primarily due to 4418 million of cash received from the equity issuance and 3627 million net cash generated from operating activities offset by 3972 million used to retire debt 1689 million used to pay the quarterly dividends and net 435 million of investments in seeding new products 

invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the european subgroup these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the 

countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2009 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 3335 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

unsettled fund receivables 

unsettled fund receivables increased from 3037 million at december 31 2008 to 3831 million at december 31 2009 due to higher transaction activities unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients of our uk and offshore funds the presentation of the receivable and substantially offsetting payable 3679 million at trade date with both the investor and the fund for normal purchases and sales reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company 

investments current and noncurrent 

as of december 31 2009 we had 3398 million in investments of which 1824 million were current investments and 1574 million were noncurrent investments included in current investments are 748 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products and 846 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans these investments are also held primarily in affiliated funds and increased significantly from december 31 2008 due to new investments purchased to economically hedge new deferred compensation liabilities that arose from both the modification of certain sharebased awards during the period discussed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 17 sharebased compensation” and the establishment of a new deferred compensation plan for certain employees of the company included in noncurrent investments are 1347 million in equity method investments in our chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company’s private equity real estate and other investments equity method investments increased by 394 million from the prior year balance the increase including a 300 million new investment in invesco mortgage capital inc ivr discussed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 16 consolidated investment products” additionally noncurrent investments include 179 million of investments in collateralized loan obligation structures managed by invesco our investments in collateralized loan obligation structures are generally in the form of a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position as such these positions would share in the first losses to be incurred if the structures were to experience significant increases in default rates of underlying investments above historical levels 

assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables 

one of our subsidiaries invesco perpetual life limited is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the uk the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability the increasing balance in these accounts from 8402 million at december 31 2008 to 12830 million at december 31 2009 was the result of foreign exchange movements the increase in the market values of these assets and net flows into the funds 

investments of consolidated investment products 

the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies is required to consolidate the vies a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also vies the primary beneficiary is the party to the vie who absorbs a majority of the losses or absorbs the majority of the rewards generated by the vie additionally under the voting interest entity voe consolidation model the general partner in a partnership that is not a vie consolidates the partnership because the general partner is deemed to control the partnership where the other limited partners do not have substantive kickout liquidation or participation rights investments of consolidated investment products include the investments of both consolidated vies and voes 

as of december 31 2009 investments of consolidated investment products totaled 6850 million december 31 2008 8438 million these investments are offset primarily in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets as the company’s equity investment in these structures is very small the decrease from december 31 2008 reflects the impact of declining market values and the deconsolidation during the period ended december 31 2009 of 533 million of investments held by consolidated investment products and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a result of determining that the company is no longer the primary beneficiary 

goodwill 

goodwill increased from 59668 million at december 31 2008 to 64676 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent the foreign exchange rates at the end of 2009 used to translate the balance sheets of foreign currency subsidiaries into us dollars the reporting currency of the company reflect a weaker us dollar at the end of 2009 mainly against the canadian dollar and pound sterling which resulted in a 4666 million increase in goodwill upon consolidation with a corresponding increase in equity additional goodwill was recorded in 2009 related to the earnout on the wl ross  co acquisition 342 million the company’s annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year as a result of that analysis the company determined that no impairment existed at that date separately due to deteriorating market conditions interim impairment tests were performed at october 31 2008 and march 31 2009 these interim tests also concluded that no impairment had occurred as each test concluded that the fair value was above the carrying value there was no need to progress to the process of separately valuing each class of asset and liability see “critical accounting policies — goodwill” for additional details of the company’s goodwill impairment analysis process 

current portion of total debt 

this balance decreased from 2972 million at december 31 2008 to 00 million at december 31 2009 as a result of the 45 senior notes maturing on december 15 2009 and being repaid from available cash resources 

longterm debt 

the noncurrent portion of our total debt decreased from 8620 million at december 31 2008 to 7457 million at december 31 2009 as 120 million borrowings under the floating rate credit facility were repaid and 1043 million in debt was retired through the tender offer transaction described below in “debt” 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 

noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities decreased by 1988 million from 9067 million at december 31 2008 to 7079 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to 1069 million of losses recorded by the consolidated investment products during the year and the deconsolidation during the period of 533 million of investments held by consolidated investment products and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a result of determining that the company was no longer the primary beneficiary 

the noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities are generally offset by the net assets of consolidated investment products as the company’s equity investment in the investment products is very small 

equity attributable to common shareholders 

equity attributable to common shareholders increased from 56895 million at december 31 2008 to 69129 million at december 31 2009 an increase of 12234 million an issuance of new shares raised a net 4418 million and the changes in foreign currency rates added 4883 million to equity other increases to equity included net income attributable to common shareholders of 3225 million share issuances upon employee option exercises of 803 million and the share based payment credit to capital of 908 million the increases to equity were partially offset by 1689 million in dividend payments 130 million related to the modification of a sharebased payment award into a cashsettled award 229 million in shares acquired from employees to meet withholding tax obligations on share award vestings and a 75 million deduction arising on the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in invesco real estate gmbh 

liquidity and capital resources 

on may 26 2009 we issued 329 million common shares in a public offering that produced gross proceeds of 4605 million 4418 million net of related expenses on june 9 2009 we replaced our existing 9000 million credit facility which was never fully utilized with a 5000 million multiyear credit facility the amount of which was based upon our past and projected working capital needs however we are able to increase the new credit facility to 7500 million subject to certain conditions at december 31 2009 the company had no balance drawn on the credit facility these two transactions reflected our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner on june 30 2009 we completed a 1000 million tender offer to purchase publicly traded debt with a 

principal value of 1043 million on december 15 2009 we repaid the 2942 million 45 senior notes that matured on that date utilizing existing cash balances having repurchased 30 million of these notes earlier in the year 

we believe that our capital structure together with available cash balances cash flows generated from operations existing capacity under our credit facility proceeds from the public offering of our shares and further capital market activities if necessary should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs including operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements additionally we expect to use available cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility to satisfy the 5000 million cash consideration related to acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business including van kampen investments new equity in the form of common and nonvoting common equivalent preferred shares with economic rights identical to common stock other than no right to vote such shares is expected to be issued to morgan stanley without holding restrictions in conjunction with the close the ultimate purchase price for the business may be higher or lower than the 15 billion announced purchase price due to contractual price adjustments that will made depending on certain conditions being met at the closing date and changes in the company’s share price for example a price adjustment may be made based on the degree to which clients of the business being acquired provide their consent for the transaction at the time of closing the deal 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities after redomicile and after consultation with the uk fsa it has been determined that for the purposes of prudential supervision invesco ltd is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current european union eu directives a subgroup however including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to these consolidated capital requirements and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2009 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 3335 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

cash flows 

the ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company’s fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

cash flows of consolidated investment products discussed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 16 consolidated investment products” are reflected in invesco’s cash provided by operating activities used in investing activities and used in financing activities cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products 

cash flows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows 

 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities is generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities although some receipts and payments are seasonal particularly bonus payments in general our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income the reduced operating income for the year ended december 31 2009 when compared to the prior year is a significant factor in the reduced operating cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was 3627 million a decrease of 1628 million or 31 over 2008 changes in operating assets and liabilities used 1183 million of cash while the combined cash generated from other operating items was 4810 million the change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by the funding of annual bonuses combined with the lower levels of accrued bonus awards at the end of 2009 together with higher trade receivables at the end of 2009 compared to the end of 2008 the change in operating assets and liabilities also includes a decrease of 450 million in the cash held by consolidated investment products 

cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was 5255 million a decrease of 3900 million or 426 from 2007 changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed 2739 million of the decrease and lower net income after adjusting for the gains and losses of consolidated investment products contributed a further 1932 million of the decrease in cash flows generated from operating activities 

investing activities 

the launch of a number of new products during mid and late 2009 resulted in a net cash outflow into seed and partnership investments of 435 million during the year during year ended december 31 2009 we recaptured 606 million in cash from redemption of prior investments including seed and partnership investments and invested 1041 million in new products

 on june 9 2009 the company completed a new threeyear 5000 million revolving bank credit facility the new facility replaces the 9000 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on march 31 2010 but was terminated concurrent with the entry into the new credit facility financial covenants under the new credit facility include i the quarterly maintenance of a debtebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement of not greater than 325100 through december 31 2010 and not greater than 300100 thereafter ii a coverage ratio ebitda as defined in the credit agreementinterest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination of not less than 400100 and iii maintenance on a monthly basis of consolidated long term assets under management as defined in the credit agreement of not less than 1948 billion which amount is subject to a onetime reset by the company under certain conditions as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with our debt covenants at december 31 2009 our leverage ratio was 111100 december 31 2008 128100 and our interest coverage ratio was 1101100 december 31 2008 1220100 and our longterm aum were 3436 billion 

the coverage ratios as defined in our credit facility were as follows during 2009 2008 and 2007

the december 31 2009 coverage ratio calculations are as follows 

 

 

 we have received credit ratings of a3 and bbb from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k standard  poor’s has a “positive” outlook for the rating while moody’s has a “stable” outlook for the rating as of the date of this annual report on form 10k according to moody’s obligations rated ‘a’ are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk invesco’s rating of a3 is at the low end of the a range a1 a2 a3 but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of baa3 standard and poor’s rating of bbb is at the upper end of the bbb rating with bbb representing standard and poor’s lowest investment grade rating according to standard and poor’s bbb obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels product type and geographies our level of indebtedness our risk appetite and approach to risk management our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance the profitability of our business under a sustained downturn scenario and integration risk related to the pending acquisition of morgan stanley’s retail asset management business additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire asset management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings however management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt these credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by moody’s or standard  poor’s each rating should be evaluated independently 

the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company’s liquidity and capital resources the executive overview of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a broader discussion of the company’s overall approach to risk management 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the company’s liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external 

firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions however we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

 

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 7457 million in total debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

off balance sheet commitments 

the company transacts with various private equity real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities of which the company is the primary beneficiary and certain of these investments are limited partnerships for which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the absence of substantive kickout liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners and are consolidated into the company’s financial statements under a voting interest entity model see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 16 consolidated investment products” and “note 1 accounting policies” for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated investment products 

many of the company’s investment products are structured as limited partnerships our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner and the entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified at december 31 2009 our undrawn capital commitments were 776 million 2008 365 million 

the volatility and valuation dislocations that occurred from 2007 to 2009 in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated pricing issues in many areas of the market as a result of these valuation dislocations during the fourth quarter of 2007 invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure these two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to accredited investors in december 2009 the agreements were amended to extend the term through june 30 2010 as of december 31 2009 the committed 

support under these agreements was 510 million with an internal approval mechanism to increase the maximum possible support to 660 million at the option of the company the recorded fair value of the guarantees related to these agreements at december 31 2009 was estimated to be 25 million december 31 2008 55 million which was recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets no payments have been made under either agreement nor has invesco realized any losses from the support agreements through the date of this report these trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary as of the date of this report the committed support under these agreements was 360 million 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2009

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

  sharebased compensation we have issued equitysettled sharebased awards to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant these awards consist of restricted share awards rsas restricted share units rsus and share option awards timevested awards vest ratably over or cliffvest at the end of a period of continued employee service performancevested awards cliffvest at the end of a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company’s attainment of certain performance criteria generally the attainment of cumulative eps growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between 100 and 150 per annum during a threeyear period timevested and performancevested share awards are granted in the form of rsas or rsus dividends accrue directly to the employee holder of rsas and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain rsus there is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share awards at their grant date 

the fair value of these awards is determined at the grant date and is expensed based on the company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest on a straightline or accelerated basis over the vesting period the forfeiture rate applied to most grants is 5 per annum based upon our historical experience with respect to employee turnover fair value for rsas and rsus representing equity interests identical to those associated with shares traded in the open market are determined using the market price at the time of grant fair value is measured by use of the black scholes valuation model for certain rsus that do not include dividend rights and a stochastic model a latticebased model for share option awards the expected life of sharebased payment awards used in these models is adjusted based on management’s best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations 

changes in the assumptions used in the stochastic valuation model for share option awards as well as changes in the company’s estimates of vesting including the company’s evaluation of performance conditions associated with certain sharebased payment awards and assumptions used in determining award lapse rates could have a material impact on the sharebased payment charge recorded in each year there have been no grants of share options since 2005 

the table below is a summary as of december 31 2009 of equitysettled sharebased compensation awards outstanding under the company’s sharebased compensation programs details relating to each program are included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 17 sharebased compensation” 

 

 

   other compensation arrangements we offer certain performancebased cash awards to many of our employees that are based upon purely discretionary determinations or alternatively certain formulaic compensation arrangements the formulaic arrangements require that we monitor on an ongoing basis whether or not preestablished metrics are expected to be met in order to properly record the related expense amounts because many of the metrics relate to matters that are highly uncertain or susceptible to change our estimates may not accurately reflect the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved and associated expense that should be recognized with respect to these compensation arrangements 

  taxation we operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

as a multinational corporation the company operates in various locations around the world and we generate substantially all of our earnings from our subsidiaries under asc 74030 deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company’s subsidiaries consolidated investment products and joint ventures except where it is our intention to and we continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings our canadian and us subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by invesco holding company limited formerly invesco plc our predecessor company which is directly owned by invesco ltd our canadian unremitted earnings for which we are indefinitely reinvested are estimated to be 1016 million at december 31 2009 compared with 953 million at december 31 2008 if distributed as a dividend canadian withholding tax of 50 would be due dividends from our investment in the us should not give rise to additional tax as we are not subject to withholding tax between the us and uk deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 23 million 2008 89 million for additional tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future there is no additional tax on dividends from the uk to bermuda 

net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the us uk and canada based on management’s belief that taxable income of the appropriate character more likely than not will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from our expectations or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the prescribed twostep process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

  goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the first step of the goodwill impairment test then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we have determined that we have one reportable segment the company evaluated the components of its business and has determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the company’s components business units one level below the operating segment level include invesco worldwide institutional invesco north american retail invesco perpetual invesco continental europe and invesco asia pacific none of the company’s components are considered individual reporting units as complete operating results are not available for each separate component the company’s operating segment represents one reporting unit because all of the components are similar due to the common nature of products and services offered type of clients methods of 

distribution regulatory environments manner in which each component is operated extent to which they share assets and resources and the extent to which they support and benefit from common product development efforts 

the principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows recent results and projections based on expectation regarding revenues expenses capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value the present value produced for the reporting unit is the fair value of the reporting unit this amount is reconciled to the company’s market capitalization to determine an implied control premium which is compared to an analysis of historical control premiums experienced by peer companies over a long period of time to assess the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit 

the company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary and corroborative fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature scope and size the results of the secondary market approach to provide a fair value estimate are not combined or weighted with the results of the income approach described above but are used to provide an additional basis to determine the reasonableness of the income approach fair value estimate 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 64676 million and 59668 million at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s assets under management or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees the company’s annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year as a result of that analysis the company determined that no impairment existed at that date our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2009 and 2008 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary 

due to deteriorating market conditions interim impairment tests were performed at october 31 2008 and march 31 2009 using the most recently available operating information these interim tests also concluded that no impairment had occurred following the march 31 2009 interim test the general market conditions improved and the company did not identify the need for further interim tests during 2009 as no indicators of impairment existed the march 31 2009 interim impairment test adopted an income approach consistent with the annual 2008 impairment tests but utilized the company’s updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and longterm net flows and the corresponding changes in revenues and expenses the primary assumption changes from the october 31 2008 valuation test were increases in the anticipated rise in equity markets in the nearterm and in net aum sales the increase in equity markets was based on an analysis of the dow jones industrial average for 10 recession events between 1945 and 2001 the october 31 2008 valuation had assumed an equity market rise inline with more normal nonrecessionary experience the higher aum net sales reflects new flows into the equity markets as values stabilize and confidence returns and also took into account the company’s improved relative investment performance a discount rate of 137 was used for the march 31 2009 test similar to the october 31 2008 rate of 136 october 1 2008 116 the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the asset management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates 

the october 1 2009 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the march 31 2009 interim impairment test with the exception that adjustments were made to remove the nearterm equity market rise assumption since much of the market rebound had been experienced in the period between march 31 2009 and october 1 2009 a discount rate of 129 was used for the october 1 2009 analysis a 40 decline in the fair value of our reporting unit or a 500 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our october 1 2009 goodwill impairment analysis would have caused the carrying value of our reporting unit to be in excess of its fair value which would require the second step to be performed the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill 

  investments most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market using quoted close or bid prices as of each 

reporting period end when a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment such as our collateralized loan obligations or clos discussed below the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values of our 3398 million total investments at december 31 2009 those most susceptible to impairment include 748 million seed money investments in our affiliated funds and 179 million invested in clo products seed money investments are investments held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 

the value of investments may decline for various reasons the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company such declines require further investigation by management which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment including but not limited to the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment as part of the review we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one three and fiveyear historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets we also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date the trend of the losses and percent declines in values of the seed money investments along with intent and ability to hold all of these scenarios are considered as part of our otherthantemporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings 

the company provides investment management services to a number of clos these entities are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing clo instruments that offer investors the opportunity for returns that vary with the risk level of their investment the notes issued by the clos are backed by diversified portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt for managing the collateral for the clo entities the company earns investment management fees including in some cases subordinated management fees as well as in certain cases contingent incentive fees the company has invested in certain of the entities generally taking a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position at december 31 2009 the company held 179 million of investment in these clos december 31 2008 175 million which represents its maximum risk of loss our investments in clos are generally subordinated to other interests in the entity and entitle the investor to receive the residual cash flows if any from the entity as a result the company’s investment is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities including changes in forecasted default rates and declines in anticipated recovery rates investors in clos have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the clo structure 

the company has recorded its investments at fair value primarily using an income approach fair value is determined using current information notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest market yields default rates and recovery rates used in the 

company’s estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools in periods of rising market yields default rates and lower debt recovery rates the fair value and therefore carrying value of the company’s investments in these clo entities may be adversely affected the current liquidity constraints within the market for clo products require the use of unobservable inputs for clo valuation the excess of actual and anticipated future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each clo entity cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers the forecasted default rate of the securities and the company’s past experience in managing similar securities if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the updated estimate of future cash flows and is recorded through the income statement 

as discussed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” the company adopted fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 “recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments” fsp fas 1152 now encompassed in asc topic 320 “investments — debt and equity securities” asc topic 320 on april 1 2009 as a result of fsp fas 1152 creditrelated impairment is recorded through the statement of income and noncredit related impairment is recorded through other comprehensive income upon adoption the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of 15 million to the april 1 2009 opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income representing the noncredit component of previously recognized otherthantemporary impairment during the year ended december 31 2009 an additional 52 million was recorded as a charge to earnings representing the creditrelated otherthantemporary impairment during the period and an additional 03 million was recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income from otherthantemporary impairment related to noncredit related factors primarily the change in discount rates during the period an increase or decrease in the discount rate of 10 would change the discounted cash flows of the clos by 06 million as of december 31 2009

strategy 

 

the company is focusing on four key strategic objectives that are designed to strengthen our business and help ensure our longterm success 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior to 2006 invesco operated as a collection of diverse business units beginning in august 2005 invesco began to leverage the individual strengths of these business units in ways that would help us operate more effectively as a unified global organization under the leadership of chief executive officer ceo mr martin l flanagan the company developed and is implementing a comprehensive operating plan designed to achieve our strategic objectives early in 2006 invesco evolved the leadership structure of the organization to ensure alignment with our strategic direction we believe these changes have strengthened invesco’s ability to operate more efficiently and effectively as an integrated global organization 

 

since we take a unified approach to our business we are presenting our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “asset management” 

 

recent developments 

 

on may 24 2007 with approval from our shareholders we changed our name from amvescap plc to invesco plc to better reflect our position as an integrated global company we chose invesco from among our many powerful brands since invesco is recognized in every market in which we operate and because being an investment management company is embedded in the name however we continue to utilize and leverage our unique investment capabilities and geographic brand presence around the world on november 5 2007 we introduced a new brand identity for invesco this move was part of our longrange brand strategy to further unify our company and build on the strength of our existing brands which helps us more effectively promote our global investment management expertise 

 

on december 4 2007 we moved our primary listing to the new york stock exchange and redomiciled the company from the united kingdom to bermuda in a transaction previously approved by shareholders to accomplish this our predecessor company invesco plc effected a courtapproved uk scheme of arrangement under which our shareholders received common shares in invesco ltd our new bermuda parent company in exchange for their ordinary shares in invesco plc holders of our american depositary shares adss and our canadian exchangeable shares also received common shares in the new bermuda parent company following the redomicile invesco ltd effected a onefortwo reverse stock split such that all of our shareholders now hold common shares par value 020 per share in invesco ltd per share amounts have been adjusted throughout this annual report on form 10k to give effect to the reverse stock split see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” for additional information 

 

on december 31 2007 invesco was added to the dow jones wilshire 5000 composite index the dow jones wilshire 4500 completion index the dow jones wilshire us largecap index and the dow jones wilshire us largecap growth index invesco ltd continues to stay in the dow jones wilshire global indexes including the dow jones wilshire global total market index and the dow jones wilshire global largecap index on december 4 2007 invesco was also added to the russell 3000 russell 1000 russell 1000 value russell 1000 growth russell midcap russell midcap value and russell midcap growth indexes additionally we continue to be a member of the russell global large cap index after the close of trading on august 20 2008 common shares of invesco were added to the standard  poor’s 500 index widely regarded as the best single gauge of the us equities market the index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries of the us economy 

 

 

 

throughout 2007 we remained committed to executing our comprehensive operating plan during this period and consistent with our plan we actively pursued multiple growth opportunities however during the summer of 2007 we began to more tightly manage the business in response to looming market pressures and volatility which threatened to adversely impact the global economy continuous improvement activities core to invesco’s operating strategy gave us the flexibility to continue to invest in our core markets and in the longterm success of our business despite these market pressures 

 

in 2008 invesco imposed an even higher degree of discipline to our business given the turmoil in the global markets in anticipation of a challenging year we directed the majority of our efforts and allocated key resources to largely those activities that we believed could best improve our competitive position over time these activities included enhancing our pay for performance approach to compensation upgrading and renewing invesco’s talent pool and investing in our etf private equity real estate and chinese operations to provide the resources and capacity to fund these efforts we undertook a number of cost saving initiatives including streamlining operations to work more effectively as an integrated global organization and more effectively managing our discretionary spending 

 

operating margin and net operating margin decreased to 226 and 316 in 2008 respectively from 256 and 360 in 2007 respectively due primarily to declines in aum see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and by calculation a reconciliation of operating margin to net operating margin and important additional disclosures 

 

certain demographic and industry trends 

 

demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and our business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our plans for taking the business forward acknowledge these demographic and economic trends as we work to further strengthen our competitive position our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities and our talented people to further grow our business and ensure our longterm success

as with all investment management companies our operations and investment products are highly regulated laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant government agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over the activities of our business including the power to limit or restrict business activities possible sanctions for violations of law include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations in general or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

 

we conduct substantial business operations in the us various of our subsidiaries andor products and services offered by such subsidiaries are regulated by the us securities and exchange commission sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra the national futures association the commodity futures trading commission and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ federal statutes that regulate the products and services we offer in the us include the securities act of 1933 the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act the investment advisers act of 1940 investment advisers act the investment company act of 1940 investment company act and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping requirements operational requirements marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations on registered investment companies as well as detailed operational requirements on investment advisers the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations in addition in recent years the sec adopted various rules the effect of which has been to further regulate the investment management industry and has imposed on invesco additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations 

 

various of our subsidiaries are regulated in the united kingdom by the financial services authority fsa our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations other regulators who potentially exert a significant impact on our businesses around the world include the ministry of finance and the financial services agency in japan the austrian financial market authority fma the bundesamt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin in germany the canadian securities administrators including the ontario securities commission the financial regulator in ireland the autorité des marchs financiers in france the china securities regulatory commission in the peoples republic of china the financial supervisory commission of the ministry of finance and the investment commission of the ministry of economic affairs of the peoples republic of china the securities and futures commission of hong kong the commission bancaire financière et des assurances cbfa in belgium the australian securities  investments commission the commissione nazionale per le società e la borsa consob in italy the swiss federal banking commission la comisión nacional del mercado de valores cnmv in spain the monetary authority of singapore the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf in luxembourg the jersey financial services commission and the dubai financial services authority 

 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities after redomicile and after consultation with the uk fsa it has been determined that for the purposes of prudential supervision invesco ltd is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current european union eu directives a subgroup however including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to these consolidated capital requirements and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2008 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4279 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate 

 

 

 

restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their distributions we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation see part 1 item 1a “risk factors” 

 

various regulators legislators other government officials and other public policy commentators have proposed or are considering proposals for regulatory reform in response to the ongoing crisis in the financial markets certain proposals are far reaching and if enacted could have a material impact on invesco’s business potential developments include expanded prudential regulation over investment management firms new or increased capital requirements and related regulation including new capital requirements and related regulation pertaining to money market funds other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements and other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over invesco certain proposals would require national legislation or international treaties invesco cannot at this time predict the impact of potential regulatory changes on its business it is possible such changes could impose material new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invesco’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and revenues might be adversely affected

 item   1a   risk factors 

 

recent volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets as well as adverse changes in the global economy have negatively affected invesco’s revenues and may continue to do so 

 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing substantial volatility and disruption for over a year in recent months the volatility and disruption have reached extreme levels these market events have materially impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so and could materially impact our financial condition and liquidity in this regard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match rapid deterioration in global financial markets 

 

in response to significant reductions in our assets under management related to recent adverse changes in world financial markets we have undertaken a variety of efforts to achieve cost savings and reduce our overall operating expenses if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace our profitability financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

our revenues would be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under our management as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management assets under management may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain relatively fixed factors that could decrease assets under management and therefore revenues include the following 

 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated approximately 36 of our total assets under management were invested in equity securities and approximately 64 were invested in fixed income and other securities at december 31 2008 through the date of the filing of the annual report on form 10k with the sec markets continue to be volatile our aum as of january 31 2009 was 3541 billion we cannot predict whether the continued volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our assets under management are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional or individual accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts therefore our revenues may decline if clients shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

 

declines in the value of seed capital and partnership investments the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products private equity and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed investments as of december 31 2008 the company had 1187 million in seed capital and partnership investments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days’ notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund’s board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the board of trustees or directors of certain other funds accounts of invesco or our subsidiaries generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under our management and individual clients may elect to close their accounts redeem their shares in our funds or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different fee structures any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or assets under management would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

 

in a risingrate environment certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its net asset value although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining net asset value some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have 175 million of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan obligation products the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates we have no significant or direct exposure to sivs or subprime commercial paper 

 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in the us and numerous foreign countries and any adverse changes in the regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict business activities possible sanctions include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities after redomicile and after consultation with the uk financial services authority fsa it has been determined that for the purposes of prudential supervision invesco ltd is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current european union eu directives a subgroup however including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to these consolidated capital requirements and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2008 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4279 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their distributions we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation 

 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes could impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

 

 

 

 

various regulators legislators other government officials and other public policy commentators have proposed or are considering proposals for regulatory reform in response to the ongoing crisis in the financial markets certain proposals are far reaching and if enacted could have a material impact on invesco’s business potential developments include expanded prudential regulation over investment management firms new or increased capital requirements and related regulation including new capital requirements and related regulation pertaining to money market funds other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements and other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over invesco certain proposals would require national legislation or international treaties invesco cannot at this time predict the impact of potential regulatory changes on its business it is possible such changes could impose material new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on invesco’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

 

civil litigation and governmental enforcement actions and investigations could adversely affect our assets under management and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of significant investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and the resulting good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries material errors in public reports employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed further our business requires us to continuously manage actual and potential conflicts of interest including situations where our services to a particular client conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage conflicts of interest but this task is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail – or appear to fail – to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in addition potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

 

many of the asset management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify guidelines or contractual requirements that invesco is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause our revenues and net income to decline we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent detect and correct such errors when an error is detected we typically will make a payment into the applicable client account to correct it significant errors could impact our results of operations 

 

 

 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financial strength stability and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

 

as part of our business strategy we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to accomplish such transactions or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions 

 

acquisitions including completed acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to execution or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

 

our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors 

 

our access to the capital markets including for purposes of financing potential acquisitions depends significantly on our credit ratings we have received credit ratings of a3 and bbb from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k both standard  poor’s and moody’s have a “stable” outlook for the rating as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels product type and geographies our substantial indebtedness and our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire asset management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing or receive mandates management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

 

a reduction in our long or shortterm credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets the current levels of unprecedented volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely affected 

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position 

 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding total longterm debt of 11592 million and shareholders’ equity of 56895 million the significant amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position 

 

 

 

 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts in full 

  our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged marketdriven decline in our operating results would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 

 

we sell a portion of our investment products through a variety of financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and financial organizations in europe and asia increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues as a result of recent market turmoil there has been both consolidation of banks and brokerdealers as well as fragmentation of brokerdealers into smaller or independent firms if these changes increase concentration among our distributors our distribution costs could rise which would lower our net revenues additionally certain of the intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants could favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future additionally if one of our major distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability moreover any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources would impair our ability to sell our products which could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients’ data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

 

our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and investors in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty vendors these systems could suffer deficiencies failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input and thus similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

 

 

 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lowercost geographic locations such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to regularly assess and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our assets under management is presently derived from the united states however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling euro or canadian dollar among other currencies could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

 

the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we have goodwill on our balance sheet that is subject to an annual impairment review goodwill totaled 59668 million at december 31 2008 2007 68480 million we may not realize the value of such goodwill we perform impairment reviews of the book values of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related assets would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period 

 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda “companies act” the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances directors and officers may owe duties to a company’s creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

 

 

 

our byelaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action both individually and on our behalf other than those involving fraud or dishonesty against us or any of our officers directors or employees the waiver applies to any action taken by a director officer or employee or the failure of such person to take any action in the performance of his duties except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director officer or employee this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation 

 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could either limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates treat the company as a us corporation and thereby subject the earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company to us taxation or both we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

 

the company and its subsidiaries’ income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

 

we have antitakeover provisions in our byelaws that may discourage a change of control 

 

our byelaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board as a result shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances

 item   3   legal proceedings 

 

following the industrywide regulatory investigations multiple lawsuits based on market timing allegations were filed against various parties affiliated with invesco these lawsuits were consolidated in the united states district court for the district of maryland together with market timing lawsuits brought against affiliates of other mutual fund companies and on september 29 2004 three amended complaints were filed against companyaffiliated parties 1 a putative shareholder class action complaint brought on behalf of shareholders of aim funds formerly advised by invesco funds group inc 2 a derivative complaint purportedly brought on behalf of certain aim funds and the shareholders of such funds and 3 an erisa complaint purportedly brought on behalf of participants in the company’s 401k plan the company and plaintiffs have reached settlements in principle of these lawsuits the proposed settlements which are subject to court approval call for a payment by the company of 98 million recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income during the three months ended december 31 2007 in exchange for dismissal with prejudice of all pending claims in addition under the terms of the proposed settlements the company may incur certain costs in connection with providing notice of the proposed settlements to affected shareholders based on information currently available it is not believed that any such incremental notice costs will have any material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 

 

the asset management industry also is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the united states and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the us and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate any material loss of investor andor client confidence as a result of such inquiries andor litigation could result in a significant decline in assets under management which would have an adverse effect on the company’s future financial results and its ability to grow its business 

 

in the normal course of its business the company is subject to various litigation matters although there can be no assurances at this time management believes based on information currently available to it that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company

executive overview 

 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

global equity markets declined in the three months and year ended december 31 2008 and continued to fall during the month of january 2009 as illustrated in the table below 

 

 

 

2008 was an extremely challenging period in the financial markets the financial crisis began in 2007 with the subprime mortgage collapse that continued into 2008 financial institutions that held mortgagebacked securities on their balance sheets took a series of writedowns that led to lower market liquidity and the collapse or consolidation of several major financial firms heightened risk perceptions ultimately led to systematic deleveraging across the global markets as investors moved out of risky assets 

 

events in these periods were dominated by challenges in the credit markets many financial institutions had difficulty securing shortterm funding as liquidity rapidly contracted with banks unable to obtain funding and reluctant to lend interbank rates rose both absolutely and relative to central bank policy rates government bonds benefited from a flight to quality particularly shortdated issues this also led to a strengthening of the us dollar from july until november as us investors unwound carry trades and repatriated funds and nonus investors increasingly purchased us government issues further credit spreads widened sharply particularly for financials and economic growth around the world slowed under the impact of the credit squeeze global manufacturing orders slumped as business and consumer confidence waned emerging markets saw weakening demand for both exported goods and commodities asian markets also experienced lower export demand with concerns about inflation becoming secondary to economic growth 

 

several major global market indices declined by historic amounts the dow jones industrial average saw its worst year since 1931 the sp 500 had its worst year since 1937 japan’s nikkei average saw its biggest decline ever and the ftse 100’s decline ranks as its worst year since it was created in 1985 

 

in response to the market disruptions governments and central banks have acted to help revive credit markets and restore stability in the financial system these actions include direct and indirect support of financial institutions the imposition of shortselling restrictions easing of monetary policy and the guaranteeing of certain financial instruments the us federal reserve cut the federalfunds rate target seven times during 2008 from 425 at the beginning of the year to setting a target rate of 0 to 025 in december a historic low despite these actions the equity and credit markets continue to operate under considerable pressure 

 

a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the pound sterling and the canadian dollar will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period additionally our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from most global capital markets declined in the three months and year ended december 31 2008 which contributed to declines in aum of 524 billion and 1429 billion during the respective periods 

 

 

 

 

assuming a continuation of yearend 2008 market and foreign exchange levels invesco expects to decrease 2009 total operating expenses by 450 million or 176 to 2110 million from 2560 million in 2008 this reduction is comprised of three components 1 48 of the reduction is expected to be realized from decreases in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses which naturally decline with aum levels 2 35 of the reduction is expected to be realized from decreases in employee compensation expenses and 3 17 of the reduction is expected to be realized from declines in other expenses including general and administrative marketing and property office and technology expenses as part of the 450 million expense reduction we expect 140 million in savings to be generated from our continued movement towards global operating platforms further use of our lowcost enterprise centers managing discretionary spending continued leverage of our centers of expertise on a global basis and managing our staff expenses we will also continue to reinvest in our business in 2009 targeting 35 million of incremental cost which is included in the 450 million total reduction in 2009 versus 2008 including investments in our private equity business exchangetraded funds common technology platforms and building out our institutional sales and client service group we expect to incur transition expenses of approximately 15 million also included in the 450 million in order to achieve the planned savings 

 

summary operating information for 2008 and 2007 is presented in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment capabilities performance overview 

 

 

 

 

 

invesco’s first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the longterm for our clients performance in our equities capabilities as measured by the percentage of aum ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance and some areas where we have been challenged within our equity asset class us core uk asian european and global exus and emerging markets have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over one three and fiveyear periods investment performance in our us value equities has lagged while our canadian equity one and threeyear year performance has sharply improved within our fixed income and balanced asset classes the global fixed income products have had at least 58 of aum ahead of benchmark and peers over one three and fiveyear periods the balanced products were largely ahead of peers and benchmarks and the us fixed income products had at least 55 of aum ahead of peers our money market capability had at least 95 of aum ahead of peers on a one three and fiveyear basis while performance versus benchmark was tempered as some of the larger products underperformed their respective benchmarks by anywhere from 1 to 24 basis points 

 

 

 

assets under management 

 

aum at december 31 2008 were 3572 billion compared to 5001 billion at december 31 2007 the decline in aum during the year was due to 1028 billion in reduced market values 266 billion impact of less favorable foreign exchange rates and total net outflows of 135 billion longterm net flows plus net flows in institutional money market funds average aum for 2008 were 4406 billion compared to 4891 billion in 2007 our retail total net outflows for 2008 were 106 billion compared to total net inflows of 57 billion in 2007 institutional net outflows were 31 billion in 2008 compared to total net inflows of 12 billion in 2007 including stable value net outflows of 162 billion in 2007 attributable to the departure of employees to a competitor our private wealth management pwm channel had total net inflows of 02 billion in 2008 compared to total net outflows of 02 billion in 2007

results of operations for the year ended december   31 2008 compared with the year ended december   31 2007 

 

operating revenues and net revenues 

 

operating revenues decreased by 147 in 2008 to 33076 million 2007 38789 million net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements net revenues decreased by 138 in 2008 to 24894 million 2007 28884 million see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

investment management fees 

 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees received from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs exchangetraded funds investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed 

 

investment management fees decreased 150 in 2008 to 26178 million 2007 30801 million due to decreases in average aum during the year and the mix of aum between various asset classes average aum for the year ended december 31 2008 were 4406 billion 2007 4891 billion a decrease of 99 average longterm aum which generally earn higher fee rates than institutional money market aum for the year ended december 31 2008 were 3608 billion a decrease of 149 from 4242 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 while average institutional money market aum increased 230 to 798 billion at december 31 2008 from 649 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 in addition our equity aum as a percentage of total aum fell from 49 at december 31 2007 to 36 at december 31 2008 this decline in equities within our asset mix is consistent with the decline in global equity markets 

 

performance fees 

 

performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved they are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date when the contractual performance criteria have been met the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect if performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms and no later than the first date of performance measurement after the expiration of these terms performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than absolute performance 

 

in 2008 these fees increased 68 to 751 million 2007 703 million the performance fees generated in 2008 arose primarily in the invesco quantitative strategies and real estate groups as well as in the uk whereas the performance fees generated in 2007 included amounts generated primarily in the uk and asia 

 

service and distribution fees 

 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees earned from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting us distribution fees can include 12b1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed generally retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 

 

in 2008 service and distribution fees decreased 136 to 5125 million 2007 5931 million primarily due to decreased retail aum offset by increases in institutional money market revenues resulting from the 230 increase in average institutional money market aum during the year 

 

other revenues 

 

other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our retail funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our real estate and private equity assets groups real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds the 

 

 

 

measurement date in which these transaction fees are recorded is the date on which the transaction is legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products 

 

in 2008 other revenues decreased 245 to 1022 million 2007 1354 million driven by decreases in sales volumes of funds subject to frontend commissions offset by higher transaction fees within our private equity business 

 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses 

 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients’ assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value thirdparty distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions call center support and client reporting thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution service and advisory expenses for the uk and canada where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues as noted above 

 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses decreased 167 in 2008 to 8755 million 2007 10511 million consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues 

 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture investments 

 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement as identified in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 4 investments” is our 490 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the “invesco great wall” joint venture in september 2008 the company entered into a 50 joint venture with huaneng capital services a subsidiary of china huaneng group the largest power producer in china to form huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd this joint venture will assess private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china 

 

the 54 decrease in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution expenses to 573 million in 2008 2007 606 million is driven by the declines in average aum in the invesco great wall joint venture our share of the invesco great wall joint venture’s aum at december 31 2008 was 30 billion a 58 decline in aum from 71 billion at december 31 2007 reflecting the increased volatility of equity markets in this region during the year 

 

operating expenses 

 

during 2008 operating expenses decreased 113 to 25598 million 2007 28846 million reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2007 expense levels 

 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense 

 

 

 

 

employee compensation 

 

employee compensation includes salary cash bonuses and sharebased payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees 

 

employee compensation decreased 818 million or 72 in 2008 from 2007 due predominantly to overall decreases in sales commissions and variable compensation offsetting these declines were increases in base salary expenses resulting from annual merit increases which were effective march 1 2008 additionally in the three months ended december 31 2008 the company experienced increases in bonus expense tied to improved investment performance and performance fee revenues these increases in bonus expense during the three months ended december 31 2008 which incorporated recognition of a full year impact tied to investment performance improvements were equally offset in the three months ended december 31 2008 by the reversal of 188 million 126 million net of tax or 05 per share of cumulative sharebased compensation charges related to performancebased share awards granted in 2007 the reversal was made because the company does not expect that the required performance targets for the vesting of these awards will be achieved of the charges reversed 108 million was originally recorded in 2007 with the remainder originally recorded in the first nine months of 2008 

 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses

marketing expenses decreased 60 in 2008 to 1482 million 2007 1576 million due to decreased marketing support payments related to decreased sales and aum in the us consistent with overall market declines during the period 

 

property office and technology 

 

property office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities depreciation of companyowned property and capitalized computer equipment costs minor noncapitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments and costs related to externally provided operations technology and other back office management services 

 

property office and technology costs decreased 116 to 2143 million in 2008 from 2425 million in 2007 due primarily to reduced depreciation charges reflecting longer useful lives for certain global technology initiatives during the three months ended december 31 2008 charges of 51 million were recorded related to vacating leased property however these charges were offset during the year by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of 82 million rent expense during the year ended december 31 2007 included a 74 million charge related to vacating leased property 

 

 

general and administrative 

 

general and administrative expenses include professional services costs such as information service subscriptions consulting fees professional insurance costs audit tax and legal fees nonmarketing related employee travel expenditures recruitment and training costs and the amortization of certain intangible assets

operating income net operating income operating margin and net operating margin 

 

operating income decreased 248 to 7478 million in 2008 from 9943 million in 2007 driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced aum operating margin operating income divided by operating revenues was 226 in 2008 down from 256 in 2007 net operating income operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements decreased 243 to 7875 million in 2008 from 10398 million in 2007 net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues net revenues are equal to operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements net operating margin was 316 in 2008 down from 360 in 2007 see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues net operating income and net operating margins 

 

other income and expenses 

 

interest income decreased 233 to 372 million in 2008 from 485 million in 2007 due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2008 the decrease in yields was consistent with the market movement from 2007 to 2008 interest expense increased 79 to 769 million in 2008 from 713 million in 2007 due to increases in the average debt balance in 2008 which were only partially offset by lower debt costs in 2008 

 

other gains and losses net were a net loss of 399 million in 2008 compared to a net gain of 99 million in 2007 the 2008 net loss included 227 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our clo products 2007 54 million and 85 million in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds 2007 0 million the impairment of the clo products arose principally from increases in discount rates and extended cash flow projections used in the valuation models and the impairment of the seed money arose principally due to extended declines in market values of the underlying funds 142 million of the combined impairment charges arose during the three months ended december 31 2008 

 

included in other gains and losses net are net gains on disposals of investments of 43 million in 2008 2007 240 million primarily driven by a gain of 74 realized upon the maturity of a clo product in which the company had invested also included in other losses are net foreign exchange losses primarily associated with longterm intercompany financing in the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 130 million in net foreign exchange losses 2007 103 million largely the result of the weakening of the pound sterling to the euro and us dollar in the three months ended december 31 2008 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 14 other gains and losses net” for additional details related to other gains and losses 

 

included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products in 2008 the net losses of consolidated investment products were 580 million compared to net gains of 2143 million in 2007 reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary invesco invests in a small equity portion of these products and as a result the majority of these gains and losses are offset by minority interests 

 

 

 

income tax expense 

 

our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world each with its own statutory income tax rate as a result our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries the majority of our profits are earned in the us canada and the uk the current uk statutory tax rate is 280 the canadian statutory tax rate is 335 and the us federal statutory tax rate is 350 

 

the uk’s tax rate decreased from 30 to 280 effective april 1 2008 on december 14 2007 legislation was enacted to reduce the canadian income tax rate over five years beginning january 1 2008 the canadian rate was reduced to 335 with further reductions to 330 in 2009 320 in 2010 305 in 2011 and finally 290 in 2012 

 

our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2008 was 329 as compared to 346 in 2007 the decrease related primarily to a net reduction in our fin 48 reserves lower state taxes and reduced taxes on subsidiary dividends in excess of an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and certain investment writedowns that did not give rise to tax benefits our effective tax rate after minority interests increased to 529 for the three months ended december 31 2008 largely as a result of the investment writedowns 2007 included a reduction in our canadian and uk deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes 

 

the inclusion of income from minority interests increased our effective tax rate to 359 in 2008 and reduced it to 287 in 2007

schedule of nongaap   information 

 

net revenues net operating income and net operating margin are nongaap financial measures the most comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues operating income and operating margin management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties which essentially are a share of the related revenues management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of distribution expenses from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide useful information to investors as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint venture investment to the operations of the business net revenues net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

 

 

 

the following is a reconciliation of operating revenues operating income and operating margin on a us gaap basis to net revenues net operating income and net operating margin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance sheet discussion 

 

the following table presents a comparative analysis of significant balance sheet line items 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

cash and cash equivalents decreased from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 primarily because cash provided by our operating activities was exceeded by cash used for financing and investment activities including the purchase of our shares in the market under our share repurchase program and payments to reduce the drawn balance on our credit facility details regarding changes in cash balances are provided within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the european subgroup these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2008 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4279 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

 

 

 

unsettled fund   receivables 

 

unsettled fund receivables decreased from 6055 million at december 31 2007 to 3037 million at december 31 2008 due to lower transaction activities unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients of our uk and offshore funds we are legally required to establish a receivable and a substantially offsetting payable at trade date with both the investor and the fund for normal purchases and sales 

 

investments noncurrent and current 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had 2449 million in investments of which 1213 million were noncurrent investments and 1236 million were current investments included in current investments are 691 million of seed money in affiliated funds and 355 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans included in noncurrent investments are 953 million in equity method investments in our chinese joint venture and in certain of the company’s private equity real estate and other investment products additionally noncurrent investments include 175 million of investments in collateralized loan obligation structures managed by invesco our investments in collateralized loan obligation structures are generally in the form of a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position as such these positions would share in the first losses to be incurred if the structures were to experience significant increases in default rates of underlying investments above historical levels 

 

assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables 

 

one of our subsidiaries invesco pensions limited is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the uk the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability the decreasing balance in these accounts was the result of the transfer of a portion of our uk pension administration operations to another provider foreign exchange movements and the decline in the market values of these assets and liabilities 

 

investments of consolidated investment products 

 

financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies consolidate the vies a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also vies the primary beneficiary is the party to the vie who absorbs a majority of the losses or absorbs the majority of the rewards generated by the vie emerging issues task force eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” requires that the general partner in a partnership that is not a vie consolidate the partnership because the general partner is deemed to control the partnership where the other limited partner do not have substantive kickout liquidation or participation rights investments of consolidated investment products include the investments of both consolidated vies and partnerships that have been consolidated under eitf 045 investment products are also consolidated under fasb statement no 94 “consolidation of all majorityowned subsidiaries” if appropriate 

 

as of december 31 2008 investments of consolidated investment products totaled 8438 million 2007 12396 million these investments are offset primarily in minority interests on the consolidated balance sheets as the company’s equity investment in these structures is very small the decrease from 2007 reflects the impact of declining market values and the deconsolidation of certain previously consolidated vies resulting from the company’s determination that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of these entities 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill decreased from 68480 million at december 31 2007 to 59668 million at december 31 2008 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent the weakening of the us dollar during 2008 mainly against the canadian dollar and pound sterling resulted in a 9263 million decrease in goodwill upon consolidation with a corresponding decrease to equity additional goodwill was recorded in 2008 related to the earnout on the wl ross acquisition 438 million the company’s annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year as a result of that analysis the company determined that no impairment existed at that date 

 

 

due to the declines in global markets experienced during the three months ended december 31 2008 the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment test at october 31 2008 and determined that no impairment existed at that date interim impairment conclusions including a reassessment of key assumptions were reviewed again at december 31 2008 and the company concluded that no significant changes had occurred 

 

current portion of longterm debt 

 

this balance increased from december 31 2007 as a result of the reclassification out of longterm and into current of 2972 million 45 senior notes that mature on december 15 2009 

 

longterm debt 

 

the decrease in this balance was due to the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 

 

minority interests in equity of consolidated entities 

 

minority interests in equity of consolidated entities decreased from 11212 million at december 31 2007 to 9067 million at december 31 2008 primarily due to the impact of declining market values and the deconsolidation of vies for which the company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the arrangements as a result of reconsideration events the minority interests in equity of consolidated entities are generally offset by the investments of consolidated investment products as the company’s equity investments in these investment products are very small 

 

total equity 

 

shareholders’ equity decreased from 65906 million at december 31 2007 to 56895 million at december 31 2008 a decrease of 9011 million the decrease included foreign currency translation losses of 10342 million with respect to subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent together with 3180 million of share repurchases offset by net income of 4817 million and share issuances on employee option exercises of 757 million dividends totaling 2071 million were recorded during 2008 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the existing capital structure of the company together with the cash flows from operations and borrowings under the credit facility should provide the company with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs we believe that our cash flows from operations and credit facilities together with our ability to obtain alternative sources of financing will enable us to meet operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements future obligations include the maturity of the remaining 2972 million 45 senior notes due december 15 2009 and the expiration of the 900 million credit facility on march 31 2010 our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating the condition of the global economy investors’ willingness to purchase our securities interest rates credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner our business could be adversely impacted 

 

invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the european subgroup these requirements require the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2008 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 4279 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

 

cash flows 

 

the ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company’s fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

 

 

 

cash flows of consolidated investment products discussed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 17 consolidated investment products” are reflected in invesco’s cash provided by operating activities used in investing activities and used in financing activities cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products 

 

cash flows for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are summarized as follows 

 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities is generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum offset by operating expenses 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was 4957 million a decrease of 4180 million or 457 over 2007 changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed 2416 million of the decrease and lower net income contributed a further 1919 million of the decrease in cash flows generated from operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was 9137 million an increase of 4578 million or 1004 over 2006 changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed 3072 million of the increase and higher net income contributed 1909 million of the increase in cash flows generated from operating activities 

 

investing activities 

 

in our institutional operations we periodically invest in our collateralized loan obligation structures through a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position and in our private equity funds as is customary in the industry other investors into these structures have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the structures many of our private equity products are structured as limited partnerships our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner we received 264 million 2007 101 million 2006 136 million in return of capital from such investments we also make seed investments in affiliated funds to assist in the launch of new funds during 2008 we invested 706 million in new funds and recaptured 335 million from redemptions of prior investments 

 

during the fiscal years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 our capital expenditures were 841 million 367 million and 379 million respectively the increase over 2007 is primarily due to leasehold improvements related to new headquarters space other expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow and backup disaster recovery systems also in each year a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices these projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows during the fiscal years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets 

 

net cash outflows of 1743 million in 2008 and 560 million in 2007 related primarily to acquisition earnout payments related to the 2006 acquisitions of powershares and wl ross  co 

 

 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities reduced from 7408 million in 2007 to 6664 million in 2008 primarily due to lower levels of purchases of treasury shares cash used for treasury share purchases in 2008 totaled 3134 million compared to 7160 million in 2007 

 

net cash used in financing activities increased from 1631 million in 2006 to 7408 million in 2007 as the increase in net inflows from share issuances were offset by the increase in dividends paid and purchase of treasury shares a summary of shares purchased by month for the fourth quarter of 2008 is presented in part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” 

 

dividends 

 

in 2008 invesco began declaring and paying dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears the 2008 quarterly dividend was 010 per invesco ltd common share on october 27 2008 the company declared the third quarter cash dividend which was paid on december 17 2008 to shareholders of record as of november 26 2008 on january 30 2009 the company declared the fourth quarter cash dividend which will be paid on march 11 2009 to shareholders of record as of february 25 2009 the 2008 total dividend of 040 per share represented a 42 increase over the 2007 total dividend of 0384 per share 

 

the declaration payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our earnings financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered the board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion with due consideration given to profit levels overall debt levels and historical dividend payouts 

 

the following table sets forth the historical amounts for interim final and total dividends per american depositary share in respect of each year indicated 

 

 

 

share repurchase plan 

 

in march 2008 the company completed the 5000 million share repurchase program that was authorized by the board of directors in june 2007 on april 23 2008 the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 15 billion with no stated expiration date during the year ended december 31 2008 123 million shares of invesco ltd were purchased in the market at a cost of 3134 million including 07 million of shares purchased directly from current executives for 200 million these shares were recorded as treasury shares on the consolidated balance sheets the company did not make any purchases in the three months ended december 31 2008 under the 15 billion authorization but did purchase 11638 shares at a cost of 121965 from a current officer of the company additionally an aggregate of 03 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended december 31 2008 to meet employees’ tax obligations the value of these shares withheld was 46 million 

 

 

 

debt 

 

our total indebtedness at december 31 2008 is 11592 million december 31 2007 12764 million and is comprised of the following 

 

 

 

for the three months and year ended december 31 2008 the company’s weighted average cost of debt was 493 and 487 respectively three months and year ended december 31 2007 524 and 522 respectively longterm debt decreased from 12764 million at december 31 2007 to 11592 million at december 31 2008 due primarily to repayment of borrowings under our floating rate credit facility as well as repurchases of longterm debt on november 24 2008 the company received board authorization to begin repurchasing up to 120 million of the 300 million 45 senior notes due december 15 2009 in open market and privately negotiated transactions as of december 31 2008 the company has repurchased 28 million at 9328 of par value due to the infrequency with which these bonds trade it is unlikely that the firm will be able to retire significant amounts of this debt in the open market 

 

in the past debt issuance proceeds have been used by the company to form part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and also for the integration of the acquired businesses over time on january 16 2007 3000 million of our 59 senior notes matured and was paid using a draw on our credit facility on april 17 2007 the company issued 3000 million fiveyear 5625 senior notes the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes interest is paid semiannually on the senior notes the senior notes are unsecured 

 

on march 31 2005 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured 9000 million credit facility with a group of lenders that was amended and restated in december 2007 in conjunction with the redomicile and relisting of the company the company draws and repays its credit facility balances and utilizes the credit facility for working capital and other cash needs the financial covenants under our credit agreement include a leverage ratio of not greater than 325100 debtebitda as defined in the credit facility and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 400100 ebitda as defined in the credit facilityinterest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters the breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility which could lead to lenders requiring all balances under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with our debt covenants the coverage ratios as defined in our credit facility were as follows during 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have received credit ratings of a3 and bbb from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k both standard  poor’s and moody’s have a “stable” outlook for the rating as of the date of this annual report on form 10k according to moody’s obligations rated ‘a’ are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk invesco’s rating of a3 is at the low end of the a range a1 a2 a3 but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of baa3 standard and poor’s rating of bbb is at the upper end of the bbb rating with bbb representing standard and poor’s lowest investment grade rating according to standard and poor’s bbb obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels product type and geographies our substantial indebtedness and our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance additionally the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire asset management industry based on their perspective of future growth and solvency material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing because our credit facility borrowing rates are not tied to credit ratings and interest rates on our outstanding senior notes are fixed there is no direct correlation between changes in ratings and interest expense of the company however management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt these credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by moody’s or standard  poor’s each rating should be evaluated independently 

 

credit and liquidity risk 

 

capital management involves the management of the company’s liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products as well as with external high creditquality financial institutions however we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

 

credit risk 

 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

 

 

 

 

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

 

liquidity risk 

 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 11592 million in total longterm debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

 

effects of inflation 

 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense 

 

 

 

increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum 

 

off balance sheet commitments 

 

the company transacts with various private equity real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities of which the company is the primary beneficiary and certain of these investments are limited partnerships for which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the absence of substantive kickout liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners and are consolidated into the company’s financial statements under eitf 045 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 17 consolidated investment products” and “note 1 accounting policies” for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated investment products 

 

many of the company’s investment products are structured as limited partnerships our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner and the entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified at december 31 2008 our undrawn capital commitments were 365 million 2007 602 million 

 

  the volatility and valuation dislocations that occurred during 2007 and 2008 in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated some pricing issues in many areas of the market as a result of these valuation dislocations during the fourth quarter of 2007 invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure these two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to accredited investors in december 2008 the agreements were amended to extend the term through june 30 2009 as of december 31 2008 the committed support under these agreements was 430 million with an internal approval mechanism to increase the maximum possible support to 645 million at the option of the company the fair value of these agreements at december 31 2008 was estimated to be 55 million which was recorded as a guarantee obligation no payments have been made under either agreement nor has invesco realized any losses from the support agreements these trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary under fin 46r 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

 

sharebased compensation we have issued equitysettled sharebased awards to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant these awards consist of restricted share awards rsas restricted share units rsus and share option awards timevested awards vest ratably over or cliffvest at the end of a period of continued employee service performancevested awards cliffvest at the end of a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company’s attainment of certain performance criteria generally the attainment of cumulative eps growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between 100 and 150 per annum during a threeyear period timevested and performancevested share awards are granted in the form of rsas or rsus dividends accrue directly to the employee holder of rsas and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain rsus there is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share awards at their grant date 

 

the fair value of these awards is determined at the grant date and is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest the forfeiture rate applied to most grants is 5 per annum based upon our historical experience with respect to employee turnover fair value for rsas and rsus representing equity interests identical to those associated with shares traded in the open market are determined using the market price at the time of grant fair value is measured by use of the black scholes valuation model for certain rsus that do not include dividend rights and a stochastic model a latticebased model for share option awards the expected life of sharebased payment awards used in these models is adjusted based on management’s best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations 

 

changes in the assumptions used in the stochastic valuation model for share option awards as well as changes in the company’s estimates of vesting including the company’s evaluation of performance conditions associated with certain sharebased payment awards and assumptions used in determining award lapse rates could have a material impact on the sharebased payment charge recorded in each year during the three months ended december 31 2008 the company reversed cumulative costs previously recognized related to performancebased share awards granted in 2007 based upon the expectation that the required performance targets for the vesting of these awards will not be attained and the awards will not vest there have been no grants of share options since 2005 

 

 

 

rsus that do not include dividend rights or cash payments in lieu of dividends are valued using the black scholes model there were no such awards granted in 2008 or 2007 the assumptions used in the black scholes model for these awards granted in 2006 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table below is a summary as of december 31 2008 of equitysettled sharebased compensation awards outstanding under the company’s sharebased compensation programs details relating to each program are included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 18 sharebased compensation” 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other compensation arrangements we offer certain performancebased cash awards to many of our employees that are based upon purely discretionary determinations or alternatively certain formulaic compensation arrangements the formulaic arrangements require that we monitor on an ongoing basis whether or not preestablished metrics are expected to be met in order to properly record the related expense amounts because many of the metrics relate to matters that are highly uncertain or susceptible to change our estimates may not accurately reflect the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved and associated expense that should be recognized with respect to these compensation arrangements 

 

taxation after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

 

income taxes are provided for in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that 

 

includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

 

as a multinational corporation the company operates in various locations outside of bermuda and generates substantially all of its earnings from our subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company’s subsidiaries consolidated investment products and joint ventures except where it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings our canadian and us subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by invesco holding company limited formerly invesco plc our predecessor company which is directly owned by invesco ltd our canadian unremitted earnings for which we are indefinitely reinvested are estimated to be 953 million at december 31 2008 compared with 880 million at december 31 2007 if distributed as a dividend canadian withholding tax of 50 would be due deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 89 million 2007 141 million for additional uk tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future dividends from our investment in the us should not give rise to additional tax as we are not subject to withholding tax between the us and uk the underlying us tax rate is greater than the uk tax rate and we have uk tax credits available there are no additional taxes on dividends from the uk to bermuda 

 

net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the us uk and canada based on management’s belief that operating income and capital gains will more likely than not be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

invesco adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 on january 1 2007 this interpretation prescribes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the twostep process prescribed by fin 48 for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement invesco classifies any interest and penalties on tax liabilities or any overpayments on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist if the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value the first step of the goodwill impairment test then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

 

the principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows recent results and projections based on expectations regarding revenues expenses capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value we have determined that we have one reporting unit as defined under fasb statement no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” 

 

the company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary and corroborative fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature scope and size the results of the secondary market approach to provide a fair value estimate are not combined or weighted with the results of the income approach described above but are used to provide an additional basis to determine the reasonableness of the income approach fair value estimate 

 

 

 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 59668 million and 68480 million at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s assets under management or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2008 and 2007 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary the company’s annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year as a result of that analysis the company determined that no impairment existed at that date due to the declines in global markets experienced during the three months ended december 31 2008 the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment test at october 31 2008 and determined that no impairment existed at that date interim impairment conclusions including a reassessment of key assumptions were reviewed again at december 31 2008 and the company concluded that no significant changes had occurred a 5 decline in the fair value of our reporting unit or a 1 increase in the discount rate assumption used during our october 31 2008 interim goodwill impairment analysis would have caused the carrying value of our reporting unit to be in excess of its fair value which would require the second step to be performed the second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill 

 

investments most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market using quoted close or bid prices as of each reporting period end when a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment such as our collateralized loan obligations discussed below the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our otherthantemporary impairment assessments are dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values 

 

the company provides investment management services to a number of collateralized loan obligation entities clos these entities are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing clo instruments that offer investors the opportunity for returns that vary with the risk level of their investment the notes issued by the clos are backed by diversified portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt for managing the collateral for the clo entities the company earns investment management fees including in some cases subordinated management fees as well as contingent incentive fees the company has invested in certain of the entities generally taking a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position at december 31 2008 the company held 175 million of investment in these clos which represents its maximum risk of loss our investments in clos are generally subordinated to other interests in the entity and entitle the investor to receive the residual cash flows if any from the entity as a result the company’s investment is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities including changes in the forecasted default rates and any declines in anticipated recovery rates investors in clos have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the clo structure 

 

management has concluded that the company is not the primary beneficiary of any of the clo entities and it has recorded its investments at fair value primarily using an income approach fair value is determined using current information notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest market yields default rates and recovery rates used in the company’s estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools in periods of rising market yields default rates and lower debt recovery rates the fair value and therefore carrying value of the company’s investments in these clo entities may be adversely affected the current liquidity constraints within the market for clo products require the use of unobservable inputs for clo valuation the excess of actual and anticipated future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf 9920 “recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets” the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each clo entity cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers the forecasted default rate of the securities and the company’s past experience in managing similar securities if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value and is recorded through the income statement an increase or decrease in the discount rate of 10 would change the valuation of the clos by 05 million 2007 09 million 2006 12 million as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

consolidated investment products financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies consolidate the vies a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also vies the primary beneficiary is the party to the vie who absorbs a majority of the losses or retains the majority of the rewards generated by the vie additionally certain investment products are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kickout liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners these investment products are also consolidated into the company’s financial statements under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” the company also consolidates certain investment products under fasb statement no 94 “consolidation of all majorityowned subsidiaries” fasb statement no 94 

 

assessing if an entity is a vie or an entity falling under the consolidation requirements of eitf 045 involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the company’s contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns involves estimation and probability assumptions if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or an investment product consolidated under eitf 045 estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related minority interest as of december 31 2008 the company consolidated vies that held investments of 1419 million 2007 8258 million and partnership investments under eitf 045 and fasb statement no 94 of 7019 million 2007 4138million effective april 1 2008 the company determined that certain previouslyconsolidated vies should be deconsolidated since the company no longer was the primary beneficiary of these entities as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation under eitf 045 

 

contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies the nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other noncurrent liabilities as appropriate for identified losses that are in our judgment probable and reasonably estimable management’s judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel ruling on various motions by the applicable court review of the outcome of similar matters if applicable and review of guidance from state or federal agencies if applicable contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded when the outcome of the contingency is resolved and the consideration is issued or becomes issuable

invesco ltd is organized under the laws of bermuda and our common shares are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ivz” we maintain a web site at wwwinvescocom information contained on our web site shall not be deemed to be part of or to be incorporated into this document 

strategy 

the company is focusing on four key strategic drivers that we believe will contribute to our longterm success 

 

prior to 2006 invesco operated as a collection of diverse business units during 2006 and 2007 invesco increasingly leveraged the individual strengths of these business units by working more effectively as a unified global organization under the leadership of chief executive officer ceo mr martin l flanagan the company developed and is implementing a comprehensive operating plan designed to achieve our strategic objectives we believe these changes have strengthened the business invesco’s primary senior management team consists of the ceo and eight direct reports each of whom has responsibility for a core aspect of our global business since we take a unified approach to our business we are presenting our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “asset management” 

recent developments 

in september 2006 we acquired powershares a leading provider of exchangetraded funds etfs as of december 31 2007 powershares managed approximately 145 billion in assets and offered investors more than 100 domestic and international etfs in october 2006 we acquired wl ross  co one of the industry’s leading financial restructuring groups expanding the range of highquality alternative investment offerings for our clients led by wilbur ross and his team wl ross  co assumed responsibility for the direct private equity operations of invesco with 68 billion in combined assets under management as of year end 2007 our 2007 operating results include a full year of operations of both powershares and wl ross  co 

on may 24 2007 with approval from our shareholders we changed our name from amvescap plc to invesco plc to better reflect our position as an integrated global company we chose invesco from among our many powerful brands since invesco is recognized in every market in which we operate and because being an investment management company is embedded in the name on november 5 2007 we introduced a new brand identity for invesco this move was part of our longrange brand strategy that will further unify our company and build on the strength of our existing brands to help us promote our global investment management expertise 

throughout the year we remained committed to executing on our comprehensive operating plan at the same time we were intensely focused on investing for growth our focus on continuous improvement gave us the flexibility to invest in our core markets and in the longterm success of our business during 2007 we undertook a number of initiatives that provided the resources for reinvesting in our business including 

 

these initiatives provided resources that were reinvested in the business to support our expansion in key markets launch new products enhance our infrastructure and retain and motivate our highperforming employees see part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data  note 13 restructuring charge” for additional details 

operating margin and net operating margin increased to 256 and 360 in 2007 respectively from 234 and 314 in 2006 respectively see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and by calculation a reconciliation of operating margin to net operating margin and for important additional disclosures 

on december 4 2007 we moved our primary listing to the new york stock exchange and redomiciled the company from the united kingdom to bermuda in a transaction previously approved by shareholders to accomplish this our predecessor company invesco plc effected a courtapproved uk scheme of arrangement under which our shareholders received common shares in invesco ltd our new bermuda parent company in exchange for their ordinary shares in invesco plc holders of our american depositary shares adss and our canadian exchangeable shares also received common shares in the new bermuda parent company following the redomicile invesco ltd effected a onefortwo reverse stock split such that all of our shareholders now hold common shares par value 020 per share in invesco ltd per share amounts have been adjusted throughout this annual report on form 10k to give effect to the reverse stock split see part i item 4 “submission of matters to a vote of security holders” and part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” for additional information 

certain demographic and industry trends 

during 2007 we saw demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and our business 

 

 

our plans for taking the business forward acknowledge these demographic and economic trends as well as our competitive position our multiyear strategy is designed to leverage our global presence our distinctive worldwide investment management capabilities and our talented people to grow our business and ensure our longterm success 

during the last half of 2007 and continuing into early 2008 through the date of this report the fixed income markets experienced unprecedented disruptions impacting the liquidity and valuation of certain securities including a variety of assetbacked securities and other securities with complex structures particularly those exposed to subprime mortgage securities these market events in turn caused the investment management industry to experience a marked decline in investor demand for certain creditsensitive us fixed income products in particular certain collateralized debt obligations cdo vehicles that directly or indirectly held these types of securities in addition certain other products including certain short duration fixed income funds experienced liquidity and valuation difficulties with respect to investments in these types of securities these events had a negative impact on several financial institutions as well as many asset managers some of these firms decided to provide financial support to these products in order to offset or prevent losses as securities were sold at or portfolio values adjusted to reflect distressed prices although invesco does have limited levels of exposure to these types of securities within its cdos and certain unregistered short duration funds among other products it manages this exposure has not created any material financial loss or a need to fund any payment under support agreements as of the date of this report in addition as of the date of this report none of invesco’s registered money market funds have experienced any significant liquidity or valuation disruptions as a result of these market factors

as with all investment management companies our operations and investment products are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant government agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over the activities of our business including the power to limit or restrict business activities possible sanctions for violations of law include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations in general or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

we conduct substantial business operations in the us various of our subsidiaries andor products and services offered by such subsidiaries are regulated by the us securities and exchange commission sec the financial industry reporting authority finra the national futures association the commodity futures trading commission and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ federal statutes that regulate the products and services we offer in the us include the securities act of 1933 the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act the investment company act of 1940 the investment company act the investment advisers act of 1940 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping requirements operational requirements marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations on registered investment companies as well as detailed operational requirements on investment advisers the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations in addition in recent years the sec adopted various rules the effect of which has been to further regulate the investment management industry and has imposed on invesco additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations 

various of our subsidiaries are regulated in the united kingdom by the financial services authority fsa our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations other regulators who potentially exert a significant impact on our businesses around the world include the ministry of finance and the financial services agency in japan the austrian financial market authority fma the bundesamt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin in germany the canadian securities administrators including the ontario securities commission the financial regulator in ireland the autorité des marchs financiers in france the china securities regulatory commission in the peoples republic of china the financial supervisory commission of the ministry of finance and the investment commission of the ministry of economic affairs of the peoples republic of china the securities and futures commission of hong kong the commission bancaire financière et des assurances cbfa in belgium the australian securities  investments commission the commissione nazionale per le società e la borsa consob in italy the swiss federal banking commission la comisión nacional del mercado de valores cnmv in spain the monetary authority of singapore the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf in luxembourg the jersey financial services commission and the dubai financial services authority 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities after redomicile and after consultation with the uk fsa it has been determined that for the purposes of prudential supervision invesco ltd is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current european union eu directives a subgroup however including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to these consolidated capital requirements and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2007 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 7581 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their distributions we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation see part 1 item 1a “risk factors” 

to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and revenues might be adversely affected

 item 1a risk factors 

our revenues would be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under our management as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows which would reduce the investment management fees we earn 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients under these contracts the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value from time to time of assets under management assets under management may decline for various reasons for any period in which revenues decline our income and operating margin may decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses remain relatively fixed factors that could decrease assets under management and therefore revenues include the following 

declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which those assets are concentrated approximately 496 of our total assets under management were invested in equity securities and approximately 504 were invested in fixed income and other securities at december 31 2007 through the date of the filing of the annual report on form 10k with the sec markets continue to be volatile and our aum as of january 31 2008 had fallen 49 from yearend levels we cannot predict whether the continued volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our assets under management are concentrated any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues income and operating margin 

redemptions and other withdrawals from or shifting among the funds and accounts managed these could be caused by investors in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities reducing their investments in funds and accounts in general or in the market segments on which invesco focuses investors taking profits from their investments poor investment performance of the funds and accounts managed by invesco and portfolio risk characteristics which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales increased redemptions of fund shares and the loss of private institutional or individual accounts with corresponding decreases in our revenues failure of our funds and accounts to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us furthermore the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts along with real estate and alternative asset products and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts therefore our revenues may decline if clients shift their investments to lower fee accounts 

declines in the value of seed capital and partnership investments the company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including but not limited to equities fixed income products and real estate investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed investments as of december 31 2007 the company had 1136 million in seed capital and partnership investments 

our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or nonrenewal and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time 

substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements investment advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days’ notice agreements with us mutual funds may be terminated with notice or terminated in the event of an “assignment” as defined in the investment company act and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund’s board of directors or trustees as required by law in addition the board of trustees or directors of certain other funds accounts of invesco or our subsidiaries generally may terminate these investment advisory agreements upon written notice for any reason mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under our management and individual clients may elect to close their accounts redeem their shares in our funds or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or assets under management would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixedincome assets may be harmed by interest rate liquidity and credit volatility 

in a risingrate environment certain institutional investors using money market products and other shortterm duration fixedincome products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments these redemptions would reduce managed assets thereby reducing our revenues in addition rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various investment portfolios and other products thus increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixedincome products if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses there could be negative pressure on its net asset value although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments the company might decide under such a scenario that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement capital infusion or other methods to help stabilize a declining net asset value some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability additionally we have 390 million of equity at risk invested in our collateralized loan and debt obligation products the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates we have no significant or direct exposure to sivs or subprime commercial paper 

we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in the us and numerous foreign countries and any adverse changes in the regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability 

as with all investment management companies our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business laws and regulations applied at the national state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry selfregulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities including the power to limit or restrict business activities possible sanctions include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements it is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us 

certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital these and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities after redomicile and after consultation with the uk financial services authority fsa it has been determined that for the purposes of prudential supervision invesco ltd is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current european union eu directives a subgroup however including all of our regulated eu subsidiaries is subject to these consolidated capital requirements and capital is maintained within this subgroup to satisfy these regulations at december 31 2007 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 7581 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european subgroup as a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their distributions we cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation 

the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations to the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale or increase the redemptions of our products and services or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products our aggregate assets under management and our revenues could be adversely affected in addition regulatory changes could impose additional costs which could negatively impact our profitability 

civil litigation and governmental enforcement actions and investigations could adversely affect our assets under management and future financial results and increase our costs of doing business 

invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations andor matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory actions see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional information 

our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients and the loss of a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability 

retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth the market for investment managers is also increasingly characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms however we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel and the loss of a significant portion either in quality or quantity of our investment management personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and profitability during 2007 several members of our stable value team departed for a competitor which resulted in net outflows of aum of 162 billion 

if our reputation is harmed we could suffer losses in our business revenues and net income 

our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients regulators and other market participants and the resulting good reputation is critical to our business our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries employee misconduct and rumors among other things can substantially damage our reputation even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients increase commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those intermediaries all of which could reduce our profitability 

the investment management business is highly competitive and we compete based on a variety of factors including investment performance the range of products offered brand recognition business reputation financing strength strength and continuity of client and intermediary relationships quality of service level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products 

we face strong competition in every market in which we operate our competitors include a large number of investment management firms commercial banks investment banks brokerdealers hedge funds insurance companies and other financial institutions some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services than we do the recent trend toward consolidation within the investment management industry has served to increase the strength of a number of our competitors these 

strengthened competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer if these competitors are successful our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition 

we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 

as part of our business strategy we regularly review and from time to time have discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations joint ventures or similar transactions some of which may be material there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices have sufficient capital resources to accomplish such transactions or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions 

acquisitions including completed acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems including problems related to execution or integration following the completion of an acquisition we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support including financial reporting and internal controls to the acquired business for a period of time there can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2007 we had outstanding total longterm debt of 12764 million which excludes 1166 million of debt held by consolidated investment products and shareholders’ equity of 65906 million the significant amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position 

we have received credit ratings of a3 and bbb from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k both standard  poor’s and moody’s have a “stable” outlook for the rating as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels product type and geographies our substantial indebtedness and our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing or receive mandates management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings 

our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and if amounts borrowed under it were to be accelerated we might not have sufficient assets to repay such amounts in full 

our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios including maximum debttoearnings and minimum interest coverage ratios this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens the breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility in the event of any such default lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable if any indebtedness under the credit facility were to be accelerated we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full 

changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 

we sell a portion of our investment products through a variety of financial intermediaries including major wire houses regional brokerdealers banks and financial planners in north america and independent brokers and financial advisors banks and financial organizations in europe and asia increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise which would lower our net revenues additionally certain of the intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing 

proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our products in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants could favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future additionally if one of our major distributors were to cease operations it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability moreover any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources would impair our ability to sell our products which could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard confidential and sensitive information 

we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations as part of our regular operations our systems could be attacked by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 

such disclosure could among other things damage our reputation allow competitors to access our proprietary business information result in liability for failure to safeguard our clients’ data result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers subject us to regulatory action or require material capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

our business is vulnerable to failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to loss of customers breaches and errors or claims against us or our subsidiaries 

the ability to consistently and reliably obtain securities pricing information process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and investors in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information processing such transactions or such reports other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us our customer service capability as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on thirdparty vendors these systems could suffer failures or interruptions due to various natural or manmade causes and our backup procedures and capabilities may not be adequate to avoid extended interruptions in operations other similar problems could occur from time to time due to human error 

if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem we could suffer material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a pandemic or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems would provide us with an important advantage nevertheless we could still experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or technology personnel further as we expand our operations in particular areas such as india the potential for particular types of natural or manmade disasters political economic or infrastructure instabilities or other country or regionspecific business continuity risks increases although we seek to regularly assess and improve our existing business continuity plans a major disaster or one that affected certain important operating areas or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates to the us dollar may affect our reported financial results from one period to the next 

the largest component of our net assets revenues and expenses as well as our assets under management is presently derived from the united states however we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the us dollar 

as a result fluctuations in the exchange rates to the us dollar may affect our reported financial results from one period to the next we do not actively manage our exposure to such effects consequently changes in exchange rates to the us dollar could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results 

the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet could become impaired which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have goodwill on our balance sheet that is subject to an annual impairment review goodwill totaled 68480 million at december 31 2007 2006 63607 million we may not realize the value of such goodwill we perform impairment reviews of the book values of goodwill on an annual basis a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired should valuations be deemed to be impaired a writedown of the related asset would occur adversely affecting our results of operations for the period 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda “companies act” the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including provisions relating to interested directors mergers amalgamations and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances directors and officers may owe duties to a company’s creditors in cases of impending insolvency directors and officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

our byelaws provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence default breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to us other than in respect of his own fraud or dishonesty which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act under our byelaws each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action other than those involving fraud against us or any of our officers or directors 

legislative and other measures that may be taken by us andor other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

under current laws as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation additionally under existing us tax rules earnings from nonus subsidiaries of the company are not subject to us taxation 

we continue to assess the impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries that could result in a material increase in our us federal and state taxes more recently several proposals have been introduced in the us congress that if ultimately enacted could limit treaty benefits on certain payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if such proposals were to be enacted or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company including increasing our tax burden increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries’ income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

following the industrywide regulatory investigations multiple lawsuits based on market timing allegations were filed against various parties affiliated with invesco these lawsuits were consolidated in the united states district court for the district of maryland together with market timing lawsuits brought against affiliates of other mutual fund companies and on september 29 2004 three amended complaints were filed against companyaffiliated parties 1 a putative shareholder class action complaint brought on behalf of shareholders of aim funds formerly advised by invesco funds group inc 2 a derivative complaint purportedly brought on behalf of certain aim funds and the shareholders of such funds and 3 an erisa complaint purportedly brought on behalf of participants in the company’s 401k plan on september 15 2006 the court dismissed the erisa lawsuit with prejudice the plaintiff has appealed that dismissal to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit oral argument was held on december 5 2007 the company and plaintiffs have reached a settlement in principle of the shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits the proposed settlement which is subject to court approval calls for a payment by the company of 98 million recorded in general and administrative costs in the 2007 consolidated statement of income in exchange for dismissal with prejudice of all pending claims in addition under the terms of the proposed settlement the company may incur certain costs in connection with providing notice of the proposed settlement to affected shareholders based on information currently available it is not believed that any such incremental notice costs will have any material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 

the company andor companyaffiliated parties have also been named as defendants in a lawsuit alleging that one or more of the company’s funds inadequately employed fair value pricing and thereby made such funds more susceptible to market timing the lawsuit is a purported class action seeking unspecified monetary damages it is now pending in the state court in madison county illinois after a series of removals to the united states district court for the southern district of illinois and remands back to the state court the auditor of the state of west virginia in his capacity as securities commissioner has initiated administrative proceedings against many mutual fund companies including aim seeking disgorgement and other monetary relief based on allegations similar to those underlying the market timing lawsuits the action against aim was initiated on august 30 2005 aim’s time to respond to the auditor’s proceeding has not yet elapsed although there can be no assurances based on information currently available the company does not believe it is probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

the asset management industry also is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination in the united states and other jurisdictions in which the company operates governmental authorities regularly make inquiries hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with 

applicable laws and regulations additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the us and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate any material loss of investor andor client confidence as a result of such inquiries andor litigation could result in a significant decline in assets under management which would have an adverse effect on the company’s future financial results and its ability to grow its business 

in the normal course of its business the company is subject to various litigation matters although there can be no assurances at this time management believes based on information currently available to it that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

on july 18 2007 our predecessor invesco plc announced that it had lost its foreign private issuer status in the united states chiefly as a result of us share ownership exceeding fifty percent of issued share capital as a result of this invesco plc immediately became subject to the full requirements of two primary securities regulators the sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom and two different accounting standards us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs different regulatory and accounting standards placed invesco plc in an untenable position that may have produced supervisory conflicts that may have impeded full compliance with the requirements of either primary regulatory scheme in response invesco plc proposed to its shareholders that the company change its primary listing from the london stock exchange to the new york stock exchange and redomicile from the uk to bermuda by order of a scheme of arrangement 

on november 14 2007 two meetings of invesco plc shareholders were held — a court meeting and an extraordinary general meeting the court meeting was convened so that the appropriate uk court would have the authority to sanction the scheme of arrangement if approved by invesco plc shareholders the extraordinary general meeting was held to authorize the implementation of the following interrelated proposals proposals

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

invesco ltd is organized under the laws of bermuda and our common shares are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ivz” 

prior to december 4 2007 we had outstanding ordinary shares that were listed on the official list of the uk listing authority and were traded on the london stock exchange we also had american depositary shares adss listed for trading on the nyse also under the symbol “ivz” each ads represented the right to receive two ordinary shares we also had exchangeable shares which were issued by one of our subsidiaries and were listed for trading on the toronto stock exchange each exchangeable share represented the right to receive one ordinary share 

on december 4 2007 we redomiciled the company from the united kingdom to bermuda in a transaction previously approved by shareholders to accomplish this our predecessor company invesco plc effected a courtapproved uk scheme of arrangement under which our shareholders received common shares in invesco ltd the new bermuda parent company in exchange for their ordinary shares in invesco plc holders of our adss and our exchangeable shares also received common shares in the new bermuda parent company in exchange for their holdings following the redomicile invesco ltd effected a onefortwo reverse stock split such that all of our shareholders now hold only common shares par value 020 per share in invesco ltd

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented this overview and the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd and its subsidiaries collectively the “company” or “invesco” and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we had net income of 6736 million compared to 4827 million during 2006 the 395 increase in net income was driven by the following factors 

 

the factors above that contributed to the growth in operating income during the year ended december 31 2007 were offset in part by the following 

 

 

invesco ended 2007 with a record yearend aum of 5001 billion an 81 increase over 2006 resulting from a combination of market gains positive flows into money market funds and foreign currency translation partially offset by net outflows of 34 billion larger aum increased operating revenues to 38789 million a 195 increase over the previous year operating expenses increased 160 to 28846 million the growth in operating revenues exceeded the increase in operating expenses producing record operating income of 9943 million in 2007 an increase of 310 over operating income of 7592 million in 2006 and a significant expansion of operating margin and net operating margin to 256 and 360 in 2007 respectively from 234 and 314 in 2006 respectively diluted earnings per share improved 378 from 119 in 2006 to 164 in 2007 see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and by calculation a reconciliation of operating margin to net operating margin and important additional disclosures 

achieving strong investment performance continues to be a strategic focus for invesco within our retail products the uk has continued to have strong relative performance versus its competitors throughout 2007 the us continental europe and asia were ahead of peers over most relevant time periods while the relative performance in canada tended to lag peers due to certain portfolios being underweight in the resources sector while being relatively overweight in consumer discretionary businesses the strong canadian dollar was an additional impediment for funds with higherthanaverage investment in foreign securities many of our institutional products were ahead of benchmark over most relevant time periods with our fixed income and money market products once again delivering consistent outstanding relative performance 

industry discussion 

global equity markets generally increased for the full year of 2007 however both equity and credit markets suffered sharp corrections at times during the fourth quarter mainly due to subprime related writedowns from the large investment banks and tighter liquidity in shortterm money markets in north america during 2007 the dow jones industrial average the sp 500 the nasdaq composite index and the sptsx composite canada were up 89 55 107 and 98 respectively in europe the ftse 100 was up 78 and the ftse world europe was up 33 and in asia the china se shanghai composite was up 979 while the nikkei 225 was down 102 the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index returned 70 for the year bolstered by two interest rate cuts by the federal reserve in the fourth quarter and despite credit concerns that increased across the broader economy the markets continue to be volatile in early 2008 our aum at the end of 2007 were 5001 billion 2006 4626 billion at january 31 2008 aum decreased by 245 billion 49 to 4756 billion due primarily to this market volatility 

assets under management 

average aum for 2007 were 4891 billion compared to 4242 billion in 2006 net outflows for the year ended december 31 2007 were 34 billion with inflows of 1199 billion and outflows of 1233 billion the primary driver of net outflows for 2007 were net outflows from the stable value product of 162 billion these outflows occurred following the departure of several members of our stable value team to a competitor in april 2007 our retail net inflows for 2007 were 60 billion compared to net inflows of 05 billion in 2006 institutional net outflows were 92 billion in 2007 including the stable value net outflows of 162 billion versus net outflows of 12 billion in 2006 our private wealth management pwm channel had net outflows of 02 billion in 2007 compared to net outflows of 07 billion in 2006 

changes in aum were as follows

 

 

our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum therefore movements in global capital market levels net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes may materially affect our revenues from period to period the returns from global capital markets declined in 2007 the total returns in local currency terms of the ftse 100 the sp 500 and the dow jones industrial average djia all declined in 2007 from 2006 ftse 100 — from 148 to 78 sp 500 — from 158 to 55 and the djia — from 190 to 89 respectively the total returns of the nasdaq increased slightly from 104 to 107 our aum by channel by asset class and by client domicile were as follows

investment performance 

 

 

within us retail over 64 of assets were in the top half of their respective peer groups on both a three and fiveyear lipper basis while 45 of assets were in the top half on a oneyear basis morningstar peer groups result in 49 65 and 50 of aum being in the top half on a one three and fiveyear basis respectively during 2007 we evaluated rationalized and merged five funds in the us retail product line and introduced six new target date allocation funds as part of our efforts to ensure we are delivering the best possible investment solutions to our clients 

in our canadian retail operations certain portfolios lagged peers in 2007 due to being underweight in the resources sectors while overweight in consumer discretionary businesses the strong canadian dollar was an additional headwind for funds with higherthanaverage investment in foreign securities 

the uk retail operations have produced particularly strong results across all measured time frames in continental europe and asia 72 57 and 85 of aum are performing in the top half of their peer groups on a one three and fiveyear basis respectively 

in our institutional operations over 98 of our money market assets were in the tophalf of their respective peer groups over one threeand fiveyear periods at least 89 of alternatives and fixed income aum were ahead of benchmark over three and five year periods the institutional equity products experienced some relative weakness over a one year period but had 56 of aum ahead of benchmark over a three and fiveyear period although measuring our investment performance against benchmarks is an important criterion our institutional operations are also evaluated against peer groups and consultant perception 

results of operations 

results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 compared with the year ended december 31 2006 

operating revenues and net revenues 

operating revenues increased by 195 in 2007 to 38789 million 2006 32467 million net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements net revenues increased by 190 in 2007 to 28884 million 2006 24280 million see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 

 

investment management fees 

investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees received from retail mutual funds unit trusts investment companies with variable capital icvcs investment trusts and institutional advisory contracts investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows outflows and market movements investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed 

investment management fees increased 228 in 2007 to 30801 million 2006 25082 million due to increases in assets under management during the year aum at december 31 2007 were 5001 billion 2006 4626 billion 

performance fees 

performance fee revenues are only generated on certain management contracts when certain performance hurdles are achieved they are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date or on the date of achievement of the performance hurdle when the outcome can be estimated reliably the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect 

performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than absolute performance in 2007 these fees decreased 144 to 703 million 2006 821 million the performance fees generated in 2006 were the result of outstanding investment performance across a number of our investment disciplines 

service and distribution fees 

service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses including fund accounting fees sec filings and other maintenance costs for mutual funds unit trusts and icvcs and administrative fees received from closedended funds service fees also include transfer agent fees which are fees charged to cover the expense of transferring shares of a mutual fund or units of a unit trust into the investor’s name distribution fees include 12b1 fees received from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include assetbased sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services instead fees for distribution services are included within investment management fee revenues for these locations 

in 2007 service and distribution fees increased 109 to 5931 million 2006 5349 million due to increased sales and assets under management 

other revenues 

other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions received upon the closing of new investments into certain of our retail funds and fees received upon the closing of real estate investment transactions in our real estate group real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties the performance measurement date in which revenues are recorded is the date on which the transaction is legally closed other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products 

in 2007 other revenues increased 114 to 1354 million 2006 1215 million driven by increases in sales volumes of funds subject to frontend commissions offset by declines in real estate transaction fees from 2006 increases in other revenues were also offset by decreases in the revenues of consolidated investment products which were primarily the result of the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities following the company’s determination that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of those entities see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 18 consolidated investment products” 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients’ assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of the client accounts renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value thirdparty distribution costs also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to brokerdealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time the distribution commissions are amortized over the contractual aumretention period also included in thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs are subtransfer agency fees that are paid to a third party for transferring shares of a mutual fund or units of a unit trust into the investor’s name thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution service and advisory costs for the uk and canada where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues as noted above 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs increased 271 in 2007 to 10511 million 2006 8268 million driven by increased renewal commissions generated by increased assets under management additionally the trend towards platform and fund supermarket sales in the uk has further contributed to the increase in these costs 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs from joint venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the company’s most significant joint venture arrangement as identified in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 3 investments” is our 490 investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited the 6481 increase in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs to 606 million in 2007 2006 81 million is driven by the significant growth in assets under management in this joint venture 

operating expenses 

during 2007 operating expenses increased 160 to 28846 million 2006 24875 million driven by increases in employee compensation thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs and general and administrative costs 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 

 

the table below sets forth these cost categories as a percentage of total operating expenses operating revenues and net revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of cost 

 

 

employee compensation 

employee compensation continues to be the largest component of total operating expenses accounting for 394 of total operating expenses for 2007 2006 430 competitive compensation is critical for the success of the company in attracting and retaining the highest caliber employees 

employee compensation increased 671 million or 63 in 2007 from 2006 due predominantly to increases in base salaries sales incentive bonuses and staff bonuses for performance against corporate objectives and 250 million in amortization related to a component of the cost of the october 2006 acquisition of wl ross  co which was accounted for as prepaid compensation see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data – note 2 acquisitions and dispositions” 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section 

marketing 

marketing expenses include marketing support payments which are payments made to distributors of certain of our retail products over and above the 12b1 distribution payments these fees are contracted separately with each distributor marketing expenses also include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications television and other media public relations costs such as the marketing of the company’s products through conferences or other sponsorships are also included in marketing costs as well as the cost of marketingrelated employee travel 

marketing expenses increased 135 in 2007 to 1576 million 2006 1388 million due to increased marketing support payments related to increased sales and aum in the us but were relatively flat as a percentage of net revenues 55 of net revenues in 2007 vs 57 of net revenues in 2006 

property office and technology 

property office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities depreciation of companyowned property and capitalized computer equipment costs minor noncapitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments and costs related to externally provided computer recordkeeping and portfolio management services 

property office and technology costs increased 51 to 2425 million in 2007 from 2307 million in 2006 due primarily to a 74 million lease charge for unused office space 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses include professional services costs such as information service subscriptions consulting fees professional insurance costs audit tax and legal fees nonmarketing related employee travel expenditures recruitment and training costs and the amortization of certain intangible assets 

general and administrative expenses increased by 882 million 425 to 2958 million in 2007 from 2076 million in 2006 this increase included growth in legal and other costs related to a 240 million insurance recovery in 2006 and to fund launch costs for a broad array of new etf products through powershares in addition during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a 128 million charge related to the relisting of the company on the new york stock exchange and a 98 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of markettiming private litigation that commenced in 2003 

restructuring charge 

we did not incur any restructuring costs in 2007 in 2006 we recorded 131 million in remaining charges related to the operational restructuring efforts that began in 2005 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data – note 13 restructuring charge” for additional information 

operating income net operating income operating margin and net operating margin 

operating income increased 310 to 9943 million in 2007 from 7592 million in 2006 driven by the growth in operating revenues operating margin operating income divided by operating revenues was 256 in 2007 up from 234 in 2006 net operating income operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements increased 364 to 10398 million in 2007 from 7621 million in 2006 net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues net revenues are equal to operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements net operating margin was 360 in 2007 up from 314 in 2006 see “schedule of nongaap information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues net operating income and net operating margins 

other income and expenses 

interest income increased 803 to 485 million in 2007 from 269 million in 2006 largely as a result of growth in our interestearning cash balances during the year interest expense decreased 76 to 713 million in 2007 from 772 million in 2006 due to lower credit facility balances and a lower coupon interest rate on the new senior notes issued in april 2007 

other gains and losses net decreased 631 to 99 million in 2007 from 268 million in 2006 included in other gains and losses net are gains on disposals of investments which increased to 322 million in 2007 from 181 million in 2006 primarily driven by gains realized upon the redemption of seed money investments also included in other gains are net foreign exchange gains and losses in 2007 we incurred 103 million in net foreign exchange losses whereas in 2006 we benefited from 85 million in net foreign exchange gains additionally we incurred 136 million in writedowns and losses on seed capital investments during 2007 2006 17 million see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 15 other gains and losses net” for additional details related to other gains and losses 

included in other income and expenses are net other realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products these net gains decreased 272 to 2143 million in 2007 from 2943 million in 2006 primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary 

income tax provision 

our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world each with its own statutory income tax rate as a result our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries the majority of our profits are earned in the us canada and the uk the current uk statutory tax rate is 300 the canadian statutory tax rate is 360 and the us federal statutory tax rate is 350 

on july 19 2007 legislation was enacted that will decrease the uk’s tax rate to 280 effective april 1 2008 on december 14 2007 legislation was enacted to reduce the canadian income tax rate over the next five years beginning january 1 2008 the canadian tax rate will be reduced to 335 with further reductions to 330 in 2009 320 in 2010 305 in 2011 and finally 290 in 2012 

our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2007 was 346 as compared to 345 in 2006 in 2007 a larger percentage of our profits originated from the uk than in 2006 which further decreased our effective tax rate similar to 2006 this reduction was offset by state taxes additional taxes on subsidiary dividends and an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses in 2007 we also reduced our canadian and uk deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and we incurred transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes 

the inclusion of income from minority interests reduced our effective tax rate to 287 in 2007 and 246 in 2006 

results of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with the year ended december 31 2005 

operating revenues and net revenues 

operating revenues increased by 130 in 2006 to 32467 million 2005 28726 million net revenues are operating revenues less thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs plus our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs from joint venture arrangements net revenues increased by 121 in 2006 to 24280 million 2005 21666 million see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the main categories of revenues and the dollar and percentage change between the periods are as follows 

 

investment management fees 

investment management fees increased 158 in 2006 over 2005 due to market appreciation on fund assets investment performance and increased sales in europe of the dublinbased offshore fund range and the uk onshore fund range 

performance fees 

performance fees increased to 821 million in 2006 from 335 million in 2005 as several institutional products exceeded performance hurdles in the uk strong investment performance contributed to the increase in performance fees 

service and distribution fees 

in 2006 increases in service revenues in the uk in line with higher aum were offset by decreases in distribution and transfer agent revenues distribution fees declined due to the full year of 12b1 rate reductions on certain us retail products the decline in transfer agent fee revenues arose primarily in us retail from a change in the subtransfer agent methodology account fee rate changes and fewer open accounts distribution and transfer agent fees in 2005 included revenues from amvescap retirement which was sold in the second half of 2005 thereby further contributing to the decline in revenues in 2006 

other revenues 

in 2006 other revenues decreased 95 from 2005 primarily due to lower real estate transaction commissions and reduced transaction commissions following the sale of our german banking license in 2005 other revenues included fees earned from our german banking business such as interest earned from balances available on demand from clients and credit institutions and commissions earned from derivative instruments 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs increased 171 to 8268 million in 2006 2005 7060 million due primarily to increases in renewal commissions partially offset by declines in thirdparty distribution fees 

proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs from joint venture investments 

management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making see “schedule of nongaap information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues the 81 million increase in our proportional share of revenues net of thirdparty distribution costs in 2006 2005 nil is driven by the growth in assets under management in our chinese joint venture invesco great wall fund management company limited 

operating expenses 

the main categories of operating expenses are as follows 

 

the table below sets forth these cost categories as a percentage of total operating expenses operating revenues and net revenues which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of cost 

 

 

employee compensation 

employee compensation continues to be the largest component of total operating expenses accounting for 430 of total operating expenses for 2006 2005 424 employee compensation expenses increased 258 million or 25 in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to 842 million in incremental noncash amortization of sharerelated compensation programs including a charge of 447 million 008 per share net of tax relating to the cumulative previously unrecognized cost to the company of performancebased share options granted in 2003 that vested in february 2007 no expense for these options was recorded in 2005 as it was not expected in 2005 that the awards would vest an increase of 155 million in staff bonuses and smaller increases in sales incentive bonuses also contributed to the overall rise in compensation costs the increases in sharebased payment and bonus costs were offset by decreases in base salary and pension costs in 2006 reflecting lower headcount levels 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs 

thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs increased 171 to 8268 million in 2006 2005 7060 million due primarily to increases in renewal commissions partially offset by declines in thirdparty distribution fees 

marketing 

marketing expenses decreased 05 in 2006 from 2005 and were 57 of net revenues in 2006 compared to 64 of net revenues in 2005 

property office and technology 

property office and technology costs decreased 148 to 2307 million in 2006 from 2709 million in 2005 lower costs reflect a reduction in the amount of leased office space and lower depreciation expense caused by a decline in overall hardware purchases 

general and administrative 

general and administrative costs decreased 75 in 2006 compared to 2005 in 2006 legal costs which included a 60 million settlement were offset by a 240 million insurance recovery related to market timing litigation in prior years professional insurance costs declined in 2006 due to reduced premiums and general recruitment costs declined in 2006 these declines were partially offset by increases in external consulting costs related to various strategic initiatives 

restructuring charge 

in 2006 we recorded 131 million in remaining charges related to the operational and structural restructuring efforts that began in 2005 in 2005 we incurred 626 million in restructuring costs see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 13 restructuring charge” for additional information

other income and expenses 

interest income increased 611 to 269 million in 2006 from 167 million in 2005 as a result largely of growth in our interestearning cash balances during the year other gains and losses net increased 268 million in 2006 from 134 million in 2005 driven by the realization of gains from our investments in collateralized debt obligations fund seed money and foreign exchange gains in 2005 we recognized 326 million in gain upon the sale of the amvescap retirement business 

income tax provision 

our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2006 was 345 as compared to 408 in 2005 in 2006 a larger percentage of our profits originated from the uk than in 2005 which further decreased our effective tax rate this reduction was offset by state taxes additional taxes on subsidiary dividends and an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses in 2005 our effective tax rate excluding minority interest was higher due primarily to the absence of lower taxed profits europe and asia operating losses nondeductible restructuring expenses and nondeductible investment writedowns 

the inclusion of income from minority interests reduced our effective tax rate to 246 in 2006 and 314 in 2005 

schedule of nongaap information 

net revenues net operating income and net operating margin are nongaap financial measures management believes that these measures are additional meaningful measures to evaluate our operating performance the most comparable us gaap measures are operating revenues operating income and operating margin management believes that the deduction of thirdparty distribution service and advisory costs from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties which essentially are a share of the related revenues management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of operating revenues net of distribution costs from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provides useful information to investors as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its growing joint venture investment to the operations of the business net revenues net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following is a reconciliation of operating revenues operating income and operating margin on a us gaap basis to net revenues net operating income and net operating margin

 

 

 

balance sheet discussion 

the following table presents a comparative analysis of significant balance sheet line items 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents increased from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 primarily because cash provided by our operating activities significantly exceeded cash used for operations and the purchase of our shares in the market under our share repurchase program details regarding changes in cash balances are provided within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the european subgroup these requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2007 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 7581 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

unsettled fund receivables 

unsettled fund receivables increased from 5616 million at december 31 2006 to 6055 million at december 31 2007 due to the timing of fund and investor settlements unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients of our uk and offshore funds we are legally required to establish a receivable and a substantially offsetting payable at trade date with both the investor and the fund for normal purchases and sales 

investments noncurrent and current 

as of december 31 2007 we had 2995 million in investments of which 1223 million were noncurrent investments and 1772 million were current investments included in current investments are 609 million of seed money in affiliated funds and 588 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans included in noncurrent investments are 747 million in equity method investments in our chinese joint venture and in certain of the company’s private equity real estate and other investment additionally noncurrent investments include 390 million of investments in collateralized loan and debt obligation structures managed by us our investments in collateralized debt obligation structures are generally in the form of a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position as such these positions would share in the first losses to be incurred if the structures were to experience significant increases in default rates of underlying investments above historical levels 

assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables 

one of our subsidiaries invesco pensions limited is an insurancetype company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the uk the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability the increasing balance in these accounts was the result of success in growing this product offering 

investments of consolidated investment products 

financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies consolidate the vies a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also vies the primary beneficiary is the party to the vie who absorbs a majority of the losses or absorbs the majority of the rewards generated by the vie emerging issues task force eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” requires that the general partner in a partnership that is not a vie consolidate the partnership because the general partner is deemed to control the partnership where the other limited partner do not have substantive kickout or participation rights investments of consolidated investment products include the investments of both consolidated vies and partnerships that have been consolidated under eitf 045 

as of december 31 2007 investments of consolidated investment products totaled 12056 million 2006 14820 million these investments are offset primarily in minority interests on the consolidated balance sheets as the company’s equity investment in these structures is very small the decrease from 2006 reflects the deconsolidation of certain previouslyconsolidated vies resulting from the company’s determination that it was no longer was the primary beneficiary of these entities 

goodwill 

goodwill increased from 63607 million at december 31 2006 to 68480 million at december 31 2007 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent the weakening of the us dollar during 2007 mainly against that of the canadian dollar resulted in a 3324 million increase in goodwill upon consolidation with a corresponding increase to equity additional goodwill was also recorded in 2007 related to the earnout on the power shares acquisition 1296 million the earnout on the stein roe acquisition 113 million and other acquisitionrelated adjustments 170 million 

current portion of longterm debt 

this balance decreased from december 31 2006 as a result of the maturity and repayment on january 15 2007 of 3000 million of 59 senior notes 

longterm debt 

the increase in this balance was due to the issuance of 3000 million of 5625 senior notes on april 17 2007 

minority interests in equity of consolidated entities 

minority interests in equity of consolidated entities decreased from 15046 million at december 31 2006 to 11212 million at december 31 2007 primarily due to the deconsolidation of vies for which the company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the arrangements as a result of reconsideration events the minority interests in equity of consolidated entities are generally offset by the investments of consolidated investment products as the company’s equity investment in the investment products is very small 

total equity 

shareholders’ equity increased from 61640 million at december 31 2006 to 65906 million at december 31 2007 an increase of 4266 million the increase included net income of 6736 million share issuance on employee option exercises of 1374 million and foreign currency translation gains of 3511 million with respect to subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent these increases were partially offset by 3529 million in share repurchases under a plan initiated in june 2007 and share purchases of 3308 million to be held by employee trusts in association with sharebased compensation arrangements 

liquidity and capital resources 

the existing capital structure of the company together with the cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility should provide the company with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs we believe that our cash flow from operations and credit facilities together with our ability to obtain alternative sources of financing will enable us to meet operating debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements 

invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the european subgroup these requirements require the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions which we meet in part by holding cash this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european subgroup or in the countries where it is located due to the capital restrictions the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited in addition transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity at december 31 2007 the european subgroup had cash and cash equivalent balances of 7581 million much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements 

cash flows 

the ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company’s fundamental financial strengths operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings our principal uses of cash other than for operating expenses include dividend payments capital expenditures acquisitions purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products 

cash flows of consolidated investment products discussed in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 18 consolidated investment products are reflected in invesco’s cash provided by operating activities provided byused in investing activities and used in financing activities cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by invesco nor is invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products 

cash flows for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows 

 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from aum offset by operating expenses 

cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was 9137 million an increase of 4578 million or 1004 over 2006 changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed 3072 million of the increase and higher net income contributed 1909 million of the increase in cash flows generated from operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was 4559 million an increase of 1490 million 486 over 2005 the increase was reduced by the decline in customer and counterparty payables a component of current liabilities resulting from one depository account sponsored by our former banking subsidiary being replaced by an unaffiliated investment fund 

investing activities 

in our institutional operations we periodically invest through a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position in our collateralized loan and debt obligation structures and in our private equity funds as is customary in the industry other investors into these structures have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the structures many of our private equity products are structured as limited partnerships our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner we received 101 million 2006 136 million 2005 134 million in return of capital from such investments we also make seed investments in affiliated funds to assist in the launch of new funds during 2007 we invested 216 million in new funds and recaptured 48 million from redemptions of prior investments 

during the fiscal years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our capital expenditures were 367 million 379 million and 388 million respectively these expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems improvements in computer hardware and software desktop 

products for employees new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow and backup disaster recovery systems also in each year a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices these projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows during the fiscal years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets 

net cash outflows of 560 million in 2007 and 2001 million in 2006 related primarily to the acquisitions of powershares and wl ross  co in 2005 we received 536 million in cash from business dispositions primarily related to the sale of the retirement business 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased from 1631 million in 2006 to 7408 million in 2007 primarily due to the purchase of shares held by employee trusts held in treasury totaling 3631 million and the purchase of treasury shares totaling 3529 million under our share repurchase program 

net cash used in financing activities decreased from 2510 million in 2005 to 1631 million in 2006 as the increase in net inflows from share issuances and borrowings offset the increase in dividends paid and purchase of shares to meet the requirements of sharebased compensation awards a summary of shares purchased by month for the fourth quarter of 2007 is presented in part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities”

dividends 

an interim dividend of 0164 per invesco plc american depositary share was declared on august 2 2007 and paid on october 25 2007 on february 1 2008 the board of directors declared a final semiannual 2007 dividend of 022 per invesco ltd common share payable on april 7 2008 to shareholders of record as of march 19 2008 shareholders who have a united kingdom address and are directly registered with our transfer agent the bank of new york mellon will receive the dividend in sterling 

the following table sets forth the historical amounts for interim final and total dividends per american depositary share in respect of each year indicated 

 

 

if dividends will be paid in the future they will be declared in us dollars on a quarterly basis the declaration payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our earnings financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered the board of directors has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion with due consideration given to income levels overall cash and debt levels and historical dividend payouts 

debt 

our total indebtedness at december 31 2007 is 12764 million and is comprised of the following 

 

debt proceeds have been used by the company to form part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and also for the integration of the acquired businesses over time on january 16 2007 3000 million of our 59 senior notes matured and was paid using a draw on our credit facility on april 17 2007 the company issued 3000 million fiveyear 5625 senior notes the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes interest is paid semiannually on the senior notes the senior notes are unsecured 

on march 31 2005 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured 9000 million credit facility with a group of lenders that was amended and restated in december 2007 in conjunction with the redomicile and relisting of the company the company draws and repays its credit facility balances and utilizes the credit facility for working capital and other cash needs the financial covenants under our credit agreement include a leverage ratio of not greater than 325100 debtebitda as defined in the credit facility and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 400100 ebitda as defined in the credit facilityinterest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters the breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility which could lead to lenders requiring all balances under the credit facility together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable this credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that among other things restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt transfer assets merge make loans and other investments and create liens as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with our debt covenants the coverage ratios as defined in our credit facility were as follows during 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

we have received credit ratings of a3 and bbb from moody’s and standard  poor’s credit rating agencies respectively as of the date of this annual report on form 10k both standard  poor’s and moody’s have a “stable” outlook for the rating as of the date of this annual report on form 10k according to moody’s obligations rated ‘a’ are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk invesco’s rating of a3 is at the low end of the a range a1 a2 a3 but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of baa3 standard and poor’s rating of bbb is at the upper end of the bbb rating with bbb representing standard and poor’s lowest investment grade rating according to standard and poor’s bbb obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels product type and geographies our substantial indebtedness and our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance 

material deterioration of these factors and others defined by each rating agency could result in downgrades to our credit ratings thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing or receive mandates because our credit facility borrowing rates are not tied to credit ratings and interest rates on our outstanding senior notes are fixed there is no direct correlation between changes in ratings and interest expense of the company however management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold our debt these credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by moody’s or standard  poor’s each rating should be evaluated independently 

credit and liquidity risk 

capital management involves the management of the company’s liquidity and cash flows the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit liquidity and market risks such as interest rate and foreign currency risks as discussed in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” through measurement and analysis the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held by external firms the company invests its cash balances with high creditquality financial institutions however we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation the company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business 

 

the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its 12764 million in total longterm debt the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods reviewing them regularly with senior management maintaining a committed credit facility scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog 

effects of inflation 

inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways first inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment our profitability could be negatively impacted secondly the value of the investments that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment declines in the values of these investments could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of assets under management 

off balance sheet commitments 

the company transacts with various private equity real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities of which the company 

is the primary beneficiary and certain of these investments are limited partnerships for which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the absence of substantive kickout or participation rights of the other limited partners and are consolidated into the company’s financial statements under eitf 045 see item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 18 consolidated investment products” and “note 1 accounting policies” for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated investment products 

many of our private equity products are structured as limited partnerships our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner the private equity funds are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified at december 31 2007 our undrawn capital commitments were 602 million 2006 192 million 

the volatility and valuation dislocations that occurred during 2007 in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated some pricing issues in many areas of the market as a result of these valuation dislocations during the fourth quarter of 2007 invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure these two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to accredited investors the fair value of these agreements at december 31 2007 was estimated to be 45 million which was recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at that date as of the date of this annual report on form 10k the maximum support that could be provided under these agreements is 330 million no payments have been made under either agreement nor has invesco realized any losses from the support agreements through the date of this report these trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary under fin 46r 

contractual obligations 

we have various financial obligations that require future cash payments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of december 31 2007 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our significant accounting policies are disclosed in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 1 accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from periodtoperiod in the future 

sharebased compensation we have issued equitysettled sharebased awards to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant these awards consist of restricted and deferred share incentive awards and share option awards timevested awards vest ratably over or cliffvest at the end of a period of continued employee service performancevested awards cliffvest at the end of a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company’s attainment of certain performance criteria generally the attainment of cumulative eps growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between 100 and 150 per annum during a threeyear period timevested and performancevested share incentive awards are granted in the form of restricted shares or deferred share awards dividends accrued directly to the employee holder of restricted shares and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain deferred share awards there is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share incentive awards at their grant date 

the fair value of these awards is determined at the grant date and is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest the forfeiture rate applied to most grants is 5 per annum based upon our historical experience with respect to employee turnover fair value for restricted and deferred share awards representing equity interests identical to those associated with shares traded in the open market are determined using the market price at the time of grant fair value is measured by use of the black scholes valuation model for certain deferred share incentive awards that do not include dividend rights and a stochastic model a latticebased model for share option awards the expected life of sharebased payment awards used in these models is adjusted based on management’s best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations 

changes in the assumptions used in the stochastic valuation model for share option awards as well as changes in the company’s estimates of vesting including the company’s evaluation of performance conditions associated with certain sharebased payment awards and assumptions used in determining award lapse rates could have a material impact on the sharebased payment charge recorded in each year assumptions used in association with option awards granted during 2005 are presented in the table below no option awards were granted in 2006 or 2007 

 

 

deferred share awards that do not include dividend rights or cash payments in lieu of dividends are valued using the blackscholes model there were no such awards granted in 2007 the assumptions used in the blackscholes model for these awards granted in 2006 and 2005 are as follows 

 

 

the table below is a summary as of december 31 2007 of equitysettled stockbased compensation awards outstanding under the company’s nonretirement stockbased compensation programs details relating to each program are included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data — note 19 sharebased compensation” 

 

 

 

 

other compensation arrangements we offer certain performancebased cash awards to many of our employees that are based upon purely discretionary determinations or alternatively certain formulaic compensation arrangements the formulaic arrangements require that we monitor on an ongoing basis whether or not preestablished metrics are expected to be met in order to properly record the related expense amounts because many of the metrics relate to matters that are highly uncertain or susceptible to change our estimates may not accurately reflect the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved and associated expense that should be recognized with respect to these compensation arrangements 

taxation after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled 

income taxes are provided for in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

as a multinational corporation the company operates in various locations outside of bermuda and generates substantially all of its earnings from our subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company’s subsidiaries consolidated investment products and joint ventures except where it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings our canadian and us subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by invesco holding company limited formerly invesco plc our predecessor company which is directly owned by invesco ltd our canadian unremitted earnings for which we are indefinitely reinvested are estimated to be 880 million at december 31 2007 compared with 600 million at december 31 2006 if distributed as a dividend canadian withholding tax of 50 would be due deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 141million 2006 70 million for additional uk tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future dividends from our investment in the us should not give rise to additional tax as there is no withholding tax between the us and uk the underlying us tax rate is greater than the uk tax rate and we have uk tax credits available there are no additional taxes on dividends from the uk to bermuda 

net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the us uk and canada based on management’s belief that operating income and capital gains will more likely than not be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

invesco adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” on january 1 2007 this interpretation prescribes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the twostep process prescribed by fin 48 for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities if it is the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement as a result of the implementation of fin 48 invesco increased its net tax contingencies liability by 176 million the increase in the liability and the related change in deferred taxes were accounted for as a decrease to retained earnings at january 1 2007 invesco classifies any interest and penalties on tax liabilities or any overpayments on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense 

goodwill   goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist if the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value then a charge for the excess would be recorded as an impairment loss the principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount the discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows recent results and projections based on expectations regarding revenues expenses capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of our weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value 

the company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature scope and size 

we have determined that we have one reporting unit as defined under fasb statement no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2007 and 2006 indicated that there was no impairment at the reporting unit level with respect to the 2007 impairment test neither a 50 increase in the discount rate nor the impact on revenues of a 50 reduction in our assumed aum would have changed the conclusion 

the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled 68480 million and 63607 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively such events include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on the company’s assets under management or a material negative change in assets under management and related management fees 

investments most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic marktomarket recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of availableforsale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market using quoted close or bid prices as of each reporting period end when a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment such as our collateralized loan and debt obligations discussed below the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist the actual value that may be realized upon the sale of these investments could differ from the current carrying values fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments the accuracy of our other than temporary impairment assessments are dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values 

the company provides investment management services to a number of collateralized loan and debt obligation entities clocdos these entities are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing collateralized loan and debt instruments that offer investors the opportunity for returns that vary with the risk level of their investment the notes issued by the clocdos are backed by diversified portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt the company earns investment management fees including subordinated management fees in some cases for managing the collateral for the clocdo entities as well as incentive fees that are contingent on certain performance conditions the company has invested in certain of the entities generally taking a relatively small portion of the unrated junior subordinated position at december 31 2007 the company held 390 million of investment in these clocdos which represents its maximum risk of loss our interests in collateralized loan or debt entities are generally subordinated to other interests in the entity and entitles the investor to receive the residual cash flows if any from the entity as a result the company’s investment is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities including changes in the forecasted default rates and any declines in anticipated recovery rates investors in clocdos have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the clocdo structure 

management has concluded that the company is not the primary beneficiary of any of the clocdo entities and it has recorded its investments at fair value primarily using discounted cash flow analyses the excess of actual and anticipated future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf 9920 “recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets” the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each clocdo entity cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers the forecasted default rate of the securities and the company’s past experience in managing similar securities if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value and is recorded through the income statement if the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary fair value is determined using current information notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest market yields default rates and recovery rates used in the company’s estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools in periods of rising credit default rates and lower debt recovery rates the fair value and therefore carrying value of the company’s investments in these clocdo entities may be adversely affected an increase or decrease in the discount rate of 10 would change the valuation of the clocdos by 09 million 2006 12 million 2005 13 million 

consolidated investment products  financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies consolidate the vies a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests generally limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive greater than 50 rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also vies the primary beneficiary is the party to the vie who absorbs a majority of the losses or retains the majority of the rewards generated by the vie additionally certain investment products are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kickout or participation rights of the other limited partners these investment products are also consolidated into the company’s financial statements under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” 

assessing if an entity is a vie or an entity falling under the consolidation requirements of eitf 045 involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity the company’s contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or defacto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns involves estimation and probability assumptions if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or an investment product consolidated under eitf 045 estimation of investment valuation is required which includes assessing portfolio activity since the last financial statement date and making inquiries of the fund manager significant changes in these assumptions could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related minority interest as of december 31 2007 the company consolidated vies that held investments of 8265 million 2006 12278 million and partnership investments under eitf 045 of 3791 million 2006 2542 million and also determined that certain previouslyconsolidated vies should be deconsolidated since the company no longer was the primary beneficiary of these entities as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation under eitf 045
