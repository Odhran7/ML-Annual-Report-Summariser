investing in our securities involves risks you should carefully consider among other matters the factors set forth below and the other information in this report the company’s risk factors set forth below are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results we may amend or supplement the risk factors set forth below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

business and operational risks 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of bein g first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

we must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources as well as emissions management energy efficiency lower greenhouse gas refrigerant usage and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today we may not adequately innovate or position our businesses for the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions hydrogen use cases in industry mobility and power generation enhanced electrical grid demand management carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power 

these trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate changerelated policies such as carbon taxes greenhouse gas emission reductions incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2022 and in past years we have made various acquisitions including our majority stake in aspen technology inc and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our planned sale of a majority stake in the climate technologies business may not be completed within the currently contemplated time frame with the expected terms or costs and may not achieve the intended benefits 

we make no assurance regarding the terms timing costs or benefits anticipated from the planned sale of a majority stake in the climate technologies business unforeseen developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax regulatory and other approvals could delay the proposed transaction or cause it to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable or at a higher cost than expected 

further we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial or other benefits of the planned sale moreover after the transaction is completed the company will be smaller and less diversified with a narrower business focus including a focus on software innovation and disruptive technologies and may encounter more volatility and be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could adversely affect our business we also may not be able to redeploy the net proceeds from our divestitures on the timing or with the benefits anticipated 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our p roducts 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters a health epidemic or pandemic or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials globally emerging market sales represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opport unities and maintain a bestcost position our and our suppliers’ nonus production facilities and operations could be disrupted by weather and natural disaster including the potential effects of climate change labor strife war including the russiaukraine conflict political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequip ped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulations in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel

industry and general economic risks 

the coronavirus covid19 outbreak has adversely impacted our business and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain 

the global outbreak of the coronavirus covid19 has significantly increased economic demand and operational uncertainty we have global operations customers and suppliers including in countries most impacted by covid19 authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of covid19 including travel bans or restrictions increased border controls or closures quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns particularly in china where shutdowns continue and such authorities may impose additional restrictions we have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of covid19 evolving 

government plans around the world create uncertainty that may impact our employees and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs which could negatively affect our results these actions have and may continue to impact our employees customers and suppliers and future developments could cause further disruptions to emerson due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships 

the impact of covid19 on the global economy and our customers as well as volatility in commodity markets including oil prices could result in further disruptions to our manufacturing operations including higher rates of employee absenteeism and supply chain which could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand additionally the potential deterioration and volatility of credit and financial markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing the extent to which covid19 will impact our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments including the spread and duration of the virus and any variants potential actions taken by governmental authorities and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover 

our substantial sales both in the us and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products globally with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets we expect sales in nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales our us and international operations subject the company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to trade investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade trade restrictions or barriers tariffs or taxes trade protection measures and retaliatory countermeasures including on imports from countries where we manufacture products could adversely impact our business and financial results in addition changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in th e past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions including workforce reductions global facility consolidations centralization of certain business support activities and other cost reduction initiatives and incur higher costs as these plans and actions can be complex the anticipated operational improvements efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized 

legal and regulatory risks 

changes in tax rates laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could adversely impact our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities the company’s effective tax rate cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof in addition the company’s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by us and nonus tax authorities while we believe our tax provisions are appropriate the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act 

and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any such violation of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability including asbestos and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim si gnificant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws in addition increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international federal andor state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more restrictive or expansive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental social and governance metrics there continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty while the company has adopted certain voluntary targets environmental laws regulations or standards may be changed accelerated or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company its products or customers which could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

increasing interest and expectations with respect to environmental social and governance esg matters by our various stakeholders could adversely affect our business and operating results 

in response to growing customer investor employee governmental and other stakeholder interest in our esg practices we have increased reporting of our esg programs and performance and have established and announced our aspirational purpose causes values and related commitments goals or targets including those regarding sustainability greenhouse gas emissions our net zero ambition and diversity equity and inclusion our ability to achieve such goals and aspirations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which rely on the collective efforts of others or may be outside of our control such risks include among others the availability and adoption of new or additional technologies that reduce carbon or eliminate energy sources on a commercially reasonable basis competing and evolving economic policy and regulatory factors the ability of suppliers and others to meet our sustainability diversity and other goals the availability of qualified candidates in our labor markets and our ability to recruit and retain diverse talent and customer engagement in our goals there may be times where actual outcomes vary from those aimed for or expected and sometimes challenges may delay or block progress as a result we cannot offer assurances that the results reflected or implied by any such statements will be realized or achieved moreover standards and expectations for esg matters continue to evolve and may be subject to varying interpretations which may result in significant revisions to our goals or progress in addition certain of our product offerings may become less attractive as standards evolve a failure or perceived failure to meet our aspirational purpose causes values and related commitments goals or targets within the timelines we announce or at all or a failure or perceived failure to meet evolving stakeholders expectations and standards could damage our reputation adversely affect employee retention or engagement or support from our various stakeholders and could subject us to government enforcement actions or penalties and private litigation such outcomes could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

 item 3  legal proceedings 

the company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings some of which claim substantial amounts of damages it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters but historically the company has been largely successful in both prosecuting and defending claims and lawsuits

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for exa mple nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures amortization of intangibles restructuring costs discrete taxes ch anges in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings 

before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes  adjusted ebita and adjusted segment ebita defined as earnings excluding interest expense net income taxes intangibles amortization expense restructuring expense first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees and certain gains losses or impairments and adjusted ebita margin and adjusted segment ebita margin defined as adjusted ebita divided by net sales are measures used by management to evaluate the companys operational performance as they exclude the impact of acquisitionrelated investments and nonoperational items ebitda defined as ebit excluding depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin defined as ebitda divided by net sales are also used as measures of the companys current operating performance as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisitionrelated investments all of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin segment earnings or segment margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments restructuring costs impacts of acquisitions or divestitures amortization of intangibles discrete taxes or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the company’s cash generating capabilities and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the companys ability to support its dividend after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend us gaap measures operating cash flow operating cash flow as a percent of net sales dividends as a percent of operating cash flow

year or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently and provides for withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes as appropriate 

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to fo recast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 9 through 11 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer typically when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and the company has a present right to payment the majority of the companys revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers generally in accordance with shipping terms a portion of the companys revenues relate to the sale of software and postcontract customer support parts and labor for repairs and engineering services 

in some circumstances contracts include multiple performance obligations where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time while a smaller portion is attributable to installation service and maintenance in sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible in other instances the company determines the standalone selling price based on thi rdparty pricing or managements best estimate for revenues recognized over time the company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue based on costs incurred the company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer 

valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 

assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations including intangible assets are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values in fiscal 2022 the company completed the acquisition of aspen technology inc and engaged an independent thirdparty valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets this included the use of certain assumptions and estimates including the projected revenue for the customer relationship and developed technology intangible asset and the obsolescence rate for the developed technology intangible asset although we believe the assumptions and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from aspen technology inc 

  

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time 

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the compa nys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the companys principal us defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 

as of september 30 2022 the us pension plans were overfunded by 513 in total approximately 16 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation including unfunded plans totaling 162 the nonus plans were underfunded by 57 including unfunded plans totaling 236 the company contributed a total of 43 to defined benefit plans in 2022 and expects to contribute approximately 40 in 2023 at yearend 2022 the discount rate for us plans was 564 percent and was 292 percent in 2021 the assumed investment return on plan assets was 600 percent in 2022 650 percent in 2021 and 675 percent in 2020 and will be 600 percent for 2023 while management believes its assumptions used are appropriate actual experience may differ a 025 percentage point decrease in the us and nonus discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at september 30 2022 by 1 00 and increased fiscal 2023 pension expense by 15 a 025 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2023 pension expense by 15 see note 12 

contingent liabilities 

the company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims including those involving general and product liability including asbestos and other matters several of which claim substantial amounts of damages the company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs including legal fees and expenses will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated accruals are based on developments to date managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters and the companys experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters t he company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims including defense costs as well as its related insurance receivables the reserve for asbestos litigation which is recorded on an undiscounted basis is based on projected claims through 2065 

although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters the company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters while the company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the company see note 13 

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the 

  

amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

cash repatriated to the us is generally not subject to us federal income taxes no provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14

fiscal 2023 outlook 

following the announcement of its climate technologies divestiture emerson will report financial results for climate technologies insinkerator and thermodisc as discontinued operations for all periods presented beginning in 2023 the earnings from discontinued operations for 2023 are expected to be 10 billion to 11 billion or 17 to 19 per share including the net gains on 2023 divestitures 

emerson expects order strength and backlog to support fiscal 2023 sales growth for the full year consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 7 to 9 percent with underlying sales up 65 to 85 percent excluding a 35 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 4 percent favorable impact from acquisitions net of divestitures 

earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be 351 to 366 which excludes any potential impact from the 45 percent common equity ownership in climate technologies income or loss postclose while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be 400 to 415 excluding a 013 per share impact from restructuring actions a 061 per share impact from amortization of intangibles 010 per share from interest income on the climate technologies note receivable and 015 per share of interest income on undeployed proceeds from the climate technologies and insinkerator divestitures 

the companys fiscal 2023 results from continuing operations after the climate technologies divestiture assumed to close march 31 2023 for purposes of the guidance above will include interest income from the 225 billion note receivable from climate technologies and reflect the 45 percent common equity ownership in the income or loss of climate technologies emerson will not control climate technologies postclosing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45 percent share of climate technologies postclose results the company will exclude the interest income from the note receivable from climate technologies and its 45 percent share of climate technologies operations in its calculation of fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share also excluded from adjusted earnings per share is the interest income on any undeployed net proceeds the effect of emersons 45 percent share of climate technologies is expected to be immaterial to postclosing cash flows the fiscal 2023 outlook assumes approximately 12 billion of dividend payments and approximately 2 billion to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases

the information set forth under item 1a  “risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks you should carefully consider among other matters the factors set forth below and the other information in this report the company’s risk factors set forth below are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results we may amend or supplement the risk factors set forth below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

business and operational risks 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of bein g first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

we must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources as well as emissions management energy efficiency lower greenhouse gas refrigerant usage and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today we may not adequately innovate or position our businesses for the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions hydrogen use cases in industry mobility and power generation enhanced electrical grid demand management carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power 

these trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate changerelated policies such as carbon taxes greenhouse gas emission reductions incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2021 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the planned combination of two of our industrial software businesses osi inc and the geological simulation software businesses with the business of aspen technology inc and our planned majority stake in the publicly traded entity that holds such combined businesses may not be completed within the currently contemplated time frame with the expected terms or costs and may not achieve the intended benefits 

we make no assurance regarding the terms timing costs or benefits anticipated from the planned combination with aspen technology inc aspentech unforeseen developments including possible delays in obtaining various regulatory and other approvals could delay the proposed transaction or cause it to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable or at a higher cost than expected further we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial or other benefits of the planned combination 

completion of the proposed aspentech transaction is subject to a number of conditions including among other things the receipt of approval from aspentechs stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals which make the completion and timing of the proposed transaction uncertain in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic could delay the receipt of certain regulatory approvals the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the proposed transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the proposed aspentech transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be completed 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact t he competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters a health epidemic or pandemic or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could b e disrupted by weather and natural disaster including the potential effects of climate change labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequip ped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulations in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance the failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results 

security andor data privacy breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages telecommunications or system failures terrorist attacks natural disasters employee error or malfeasance server or cloud provider breaches and computer viruses or cyberattacks cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its thirdparty service providers despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period in addition it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation liability or penalties under privacy laws increased cybersecurity protection costs reputational damage and product failure in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business 

and personal data in the us and elsewhere compliance with privacy and localization laws and regulations increases operational complexity failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to fines and penalties as well as legal and reputational risks including proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others 

our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized and a major product failure or similar event caused by defects cybersecurity incidents or other failures could adversely affect our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leadingedge technology including both hardware and software many of our products and services including measurement and analytical instrumentation industrial valves and equipment and process control systems are integrated and used in complex process hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments as a result the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant while we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems including through manufacturing or design defects process or other failures of contractors or thirdparty suppliers cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to thirdparty claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

industry and general economic risks 

the coronavirus covid19 outbreak has adversely impacted our business and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain 

the global outbreak of the coronavirus covid19 has significantly increased economic demand and operational uncertainty we have global operations customers and suppliers including in countries most impacted by covid19 authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of covid19 including travel bans or restrictions increased border controls or closures quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions we have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of covid19 including embracing guidelines set by the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention on social distancing good hygiene restrictions on employee travel and inperson meetings and changes to employee work arrangements including remote work arrangements where appropriate evolving government plans around the world to institute vaccination mandates including in the us create uncertainty that may impact our employees and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs which could negatively affect our results these actions have and may continue to impact our employees customers and suppliers and future developments could cause further disruptions to emerson due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships 

the impact of covid19 on the global economy and our customers as well as volatility in commodity markets including oil prices has negatively impacted demand for our products and could continue to do so in the future its effects could also result in further disruptions to our manufacturing operations including higher rates of employee absenteeism and supply chain which could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand additionally the potential deterioration and volatility of credit and financial markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing the extent to which covid19 will impact our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments including the spread and duration of the virus potential actions taken by governmental authorities and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover 

our substantial sales both in the us and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products globally with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets we expect sales in nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales our us and international operations subject the company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to trade investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade trade restrictions or barriers tariffs or taxes trade protection measures and retaliatory countermeasures including on imports from countries where we manufacture products could adversely impact our business and financial results in addition changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in th e past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions including workforce reductions global facility consolidations centralization of certain business support activities and other cost reduction initiatives and incur higher costs as these plans and actions can be complex the anticipated operational improvements efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized 

legal and regulatory risks 

changes in tax rates laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could adversely impact our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities the company’s effective tax rate cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof in addition the company’s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by us and nonus tax authorities while we believe our tax provisions are appropriate the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any such violation of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability including asbestos and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim si gnificant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that 

existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws in addition increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international federal andor state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more restrictive or expansive standards such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental social and governance metrics there continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty while the company has adopted certain voluntary targets environmental laws regulations or standards may be changed accelerated or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company its products or customers which could negatively impact the company’s business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

 item 3  legal proceedings 

the company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings some of which claim substantial amounts of damages it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters but historically the company has been largely successful in both prosecuting and defending claims and lawsuits

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and 

prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for exa mple nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures amortization of intangibles restructuring costs discrete taxes ch anges in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes ebitda defined as ebit excluding depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin defined as ebitda divided by net sales are used as measures of the companys current operating performance as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisitionrelated investments all of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments restructuring costs impacts of acquisitions or divestitures amortization of intangibles discrete taxes or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the company’s cash generating capabilities and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the companys ability to support its dividend after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend us gaap measures operating cash flow operating cash flow as a percent of net sales dividends as a percent of operating cash flow

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 9 through 11 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer typically when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and the company has a present right to payment the vast majority of the companys revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers generally in accordance with shipping terms a portion of the companys revenues relate to the sale of software and postcontract customer support parts and labor for repairs and engineering services 

in limited circumstances contracts include multiple performance obligations where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time while a smaller portion is attributable to installation service and maintenance in sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible in other instances the company determines the standalone selling price based on thirdparty pricing or managements best estimate for revenues recognized over time the company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue based on costs incurred the company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time 

  

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the compa nys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the companys principal us defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 

as of september 30 2021 the us pension plans were overfunded by 506 in total approximately 12 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation including unfunded plans totaling 220 the substantial improvement in the funded status reflects strong asset returns in fiscal 2021 the nonus plans were underfunded by 88 including unfunded plans totaling 318 the company contributed a total of 41 to defined benefit plans in 2021 and expects to contribute approximately 50 in 2022 at yearend 2021 the discount rate for us plans was 292 percent and was 281 percent in 2020 the assumed investment return on plan assets was 650 percent in 2021 675 percent in 2020 and 700 percent in 2019 and will be 600 percent for 2022 while management believes its assumptions used are appropriate actual experience may differ a 025 percentage point decrease in the us and nonus discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at september 30 2021 by 200 and increased fiscal 2022 pension expense by 15 a 025 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2022 pension expense by 15 see note 12 

contingent liabilities 

the company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims including those involving general and product liability including asbestos and other matters several of which claim substantial amounts of damages the company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs including legal fees and expenses will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated accruals are based on developments to date managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters and the companys experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters the company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims including defense costs as well as its related insurance receivables the reserve for asbestos litigation which is recorded on an undiscounted basis is based on projected claims through 2065 

although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters the company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters while the company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the company see note 13 

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

cash repatriated to the us is generally not subject to us federal income taxes no provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries 

  

where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14 

other items 

legal matters 

at september 30 2021 there were no known contingent liabilities including guarantees pending litigation taxes and other claims that management believes will be material in relation to the companys financial statements nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business 

new accounting pronouncements 

effective october 1 2020 the company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to asc 815 all of which had an immaterial impact on the companys financial statements these included 

• updates to asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  which eliminate the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill instead goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 

• updates to asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software 

• adoption of asc 326 financial instruments  credit losses  which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forwardlooking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments including trade receivables 

• updates to asc 815 derivatives and hedging  which permit hedging certain contractually specified risk components the updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements 

on october 1 2019 the company adopted asc 842 leases which requires rights and obligations related to lease arrangements to be recognized on the balance sheet using the optional transition method under which prior periods were not adjusted the company elected the package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to the adoption date which included carrying forward the historical lease classification as operating or finance the adoption of asc 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease rightofuse assets and related lease liabilities of approximately 500 as of october 1 2019 but did not materially impact the companys earnings or cash flows for the year ended september 30 2020 the companys financial statements for 2019 continue to be reported in accordance with the companys historical accounting under asc 840 leases  

on october 1 2018 the company adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  which updated and consolidated revenue recognition guidance from multiple sources into a single comprehensive standard to be applied for all contracts with customers the fundamental principle of the revised standard is to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods and services to customers at the amount the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services the company adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the guidance to open contracts which were not completed at the date of adoption the cumulative effect of adoption resulted in a 30 increase to beginning retained earnings as of october 1 2018 this increase primarily related to contracts where a portion of revenue for delivered goods or services was previously deferred due to contingent payment terms the adoption of asc 606 did not materially impact the companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended september 30 2019

competition 

the companys businesses operate in highly competitive markets the company competes based on product performance quality branding service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of the companys competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost although no single company competes directly with emerson in all of the companys product lines various companies compete in one or more product lines with the number of competitors varying by product line some competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than emerson and the company also competes with many smaller companies management believes emerson has a market leadership position in many of its product lines 

regulations 

the companys operations products and services are subject to various government regulations including environmental regulations our manufacturing locations generate waste of which treatment storage transportation and disposal are subject to us federal state foreign andor local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment the company continually works to minimize the environmental impact of its operations through safe technologies facility design and operating procedures compliance with government regulations including environmental regulations has not had and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect is not expected to have a material effect on the companys capital expenditures including expenditures for environmental control facilities earnings or competitive position however laws and regulations may be changed accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company and which could negatively impact our operating results see item 1a  risk factors 

human capital resources

investing in our securities involves risks you should carefully consider among other matters the factors set forth below and the other information in this report the company’s risk factors set forth below are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results we may amend or supplement the risk factors set forth below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

business and operational risks 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures 

could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2020 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters a health epidemic or pandemic or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in 

emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulations in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance the failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 

security andor data privacy breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages telecommunications or system failures terrorist attacks natural disasters employee error or malfeasance server or cloud provider breaches and computer viruses or cyberattacks cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its thirdparty service providers despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period in addition it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation liability or penalties under privacy laws increased cybersecurity protection costs reputational damage and product failure in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the us and elsewhere compliance with privacy and localization laws and regulations increases operational complexity failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to fines and penalties as well as legal and reputational risks including proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others 

our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized and a major product failure or similar event caused by defects cybersecurity incidents or other failures could adversely affect our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leadingedge technology including both hardware and software many of our products and services including measurement and analytical instrumentation industrial valves and equipment and process control systems are integrated and used in complex process hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments as a result the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant while we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems including through manufacturing or design defects process or other failures of contractors or thirdparty suppliers cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to thirdparty claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

industry and general economic risks 

the coronavirus covid19 outbreak has adversely impacted our business and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain 

the global outbreak of the coronavirus covid19 has significantly increased economic demand and operational uncertainty we have global operations customers and suppliers including in countries most impacted by covid19 authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of covid19 including travel bans or restrictions increased border controls or closures quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions we have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of covid19 including embracing guidelines set by the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention on social distancing good hygiene restrictions on employee travel and inperson meetings and changes to employee work arrangements including remote work arrangements where appropriate the actions taken around the world to slow the spread of covid19 have also impacted our customers and suppliers and future developments could cause further disruptions to emerson due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships 

the impact of covid19 on the global economy and our customers as well as volatility in commodity markets including oil prices has negatively impacted demand for our products and could continue to do so in the future its effects could also result in further disruptions to our manufacturing operations including higher rates of employee absenteeism and supply chain which could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand additionally the potential deterioration and volatility of credit and financial markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing the extent to which covid19 will impact our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments including the spread and duration of the virus potential actions taken by governmental authorities and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover 

our substantial sales both in the us and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products globally with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets we expect sales in nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales our us and international operations subject the company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to trade investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade trade restrictions or barriers tariffs or taxes trade protection measures and retaliatory countermeasures including on imports from countries where we manufacture products could adversely impact our business and financial results in addition changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in th e past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions including workforce reductions global facility consolidations centralization of certain business support activities and other cost reduction initiatives and incur higher costs as these plans and actions can be complex the anticipated operational improvements efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions acquisitions or divestitures us tax reform changes in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes ebitda defined as ebit excluding depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin defined as ebitda divided by net sales are used as measures of the companys current operating performance as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisitionrelated investments all of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments restructuring costs impacts of the strategic portfolio repositioning actions and other acquisitions or divestitures impacts of us tax reform or other discrete taxes or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the company’s cash generating capabilities and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the companys ability to support its dividend after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend us gaap measures operating cash flow operating cash flow as a percent of net sales dividends as a percent of operating cash flow

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2020 the companys contractual obligations including estimated payments are as follows 



purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements the table above does not include the majority of other noncurrent liabilities except for leaserelated obligations which total 2324 and consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities asbestos litigation deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits because it is not certain when these amounts will become due see note 12 for estimated future benefit payments and note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes 

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 9 through 11 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred 

  

to the customer typically when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and the company has a present right to payment the vast majority of the companys revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers generally in accordance with shipping terms a portion of the companys revenues relate to the sale of software and postcontract customer support parts and labor for repairs and engineering services 

in limited circumstances contracts include multiple performance obligations where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time while a smaller portion is attributable to installation service and maintenance in sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible in other instances the company determines the standalone selling price based on thirdparty pricing or managements best estimate for revenues recognized over time the company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue based on costs incurred the company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations 

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases management believes the assumptions used are appropriate however actual experience may differ in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the companys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the c ompanys principal us defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 

as of september 30 2020 the us pension plans were underfunded by 142 in total including unfunded plans totaling 223 the nonus plans were underfunded by 266 including unfunded plans totaling 319 the company contributed a total of 66 to defined benefit plans in 2020 and expects to contribute approximately 50 in 2021 at yearend 2020 the discount rate for us plans was 281 percent and was 322 percent in 2019 the assumed investment return on plan assets was 675 percent in 2020 700 percent in 2019 and 700 percent in 2018 and will be 650 percent for 2021 deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were 1253 950 aftertax as of september 30 2020 see notes 12 and 13 

contingent liabilities 

the company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims including those involving general and product liability including asbestos and other matters several of which claim substantial amounts of damages the company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs including legal fees and expenses will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated accruals are based on developments to date managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters and the companys experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters the company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to 

  

resolve all pending and future asbestos claims including defense costs as well as its related insurance receivables the reserve for asbestos litigation which is recorded on an undiscounted basis is based on projected claims through 2065 

although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters the company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters while the company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the company see note 13 

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act which made comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws by moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime as a result cash repatriated to the us is generally no longer subject to us federal income taxes no provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14

in january 2017 the fasb issued updates to asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  eliminating the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill instead goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value these updates are effective prospectively beginning in fiscal 2021 and are not expected to impact the companys financial statements unless a potential goodwill impairment is identified

in aug ust 2018 the fasb issued updates to asc 715 compensation  retirement benefits  which modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit plans or other postretirement plans these updates are effective in fiscal 2021 and must be adopted on a retrospective basis the updates change disclosures only and will not impact the company’s results of operations

competition 

the companys businesses operate in highly competitive markets the company competes based on product performance quality branding service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of the companys competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost although no single company competes directly with emerson in all of the companys product lines various companies compete in one or more product lines with the number of competitors varying by product line some competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than emerson and the company also competes with many smaller companies management believes emerson has a market leadership position in many of its product lines 

environment

the information set forth under item 1a  “risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2019 and in past years we have made various acquisitions including the valves  controls business in 2017 and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulations in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales both in the us and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products globally with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets we expect sales in nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales our us and international operations subject the company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to trade investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade trade restrictions or barriers tariffs or taxes trade protection measures and retaliatory countermeasures including on imports from countries where we manufacture products could adversely impact our business and financial results in addition changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in the past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions and incur higher costs if our restructuring actions are not sufficiently effective we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results in addition these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets 

changes in tax rates laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could adversely impact our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities the company’s effective tax rate cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof for example on december 22 2017 the us government enacted tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” which made comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws by moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime the changes made by the act are broad and complex in addition the company’s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by us and nonus tax authorities while we believe our tax provisions are appropriate the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could adversely affect our financial results 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance the failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations which are potentially conflicting and customerimposed controls these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages telecommunications or system failures terrorist attacks natural disasters employee error or malfeasance server or cloud provider breaches and computer viruses or cyberattacks cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its thirdparty service providers despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended 

period up to and including several years in addition it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation liability or penalties under privacy laws increased cybersecurity protection costs reputational damage and product failure 

our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized and a major product failure or similar event caused by defects cybersecurity incidents or other failures could adversely affect our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leadingedge technology including both hardware and software many of our products and services including measurement and analytical instrumentation industrial valves and equipment and process control systems are integrated and used in complex process hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments as a result the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant while we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems including through manufacturing or design defects process or other failures of contractors or thirdparty suppliers cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to thirdparty claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption antibribery export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any such violation of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the us and other jurisdictions could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation our business and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability including asbestos and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions other acquisitions or divestitures us tax reform changes in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes ebitda defined as ebit excluding depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin defined as ebitda divided by net sales are used as measures of the companys current operating performance as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisitionrelated investments all of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the company’s cash generating capabilities and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the companys ability to support its dividend after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend us gaap measures operating cash flow operating cash flow as a percent of net sales dividends as a percent of operating cash flow

purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements the table above does not include 20 billion of other noncurrent liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and summarized in note 19 which consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities asbestos litigation deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits because it is not certain when these amounts will become due see notes 11 and 12 for estimated future benefit payments and note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes 

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 8 through 10 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer typically when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and the company has a present right to payment the vast majority of the companys revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers generally in accordance with shipping terms a portion of the companys revenues relate to the sale of software and postcontract customer support parts and labor for repairs and engineering services 

in limited circumstances contracts include multiple performance obligations where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time while a smaller portion is attributable to installation service and maintenance in sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible in other instances the company determines the 

standalone selling price based on thirdparty pricing or managements best estimate for revenues recognized over time the company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue based on costs incurred the company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations 

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases management believes the assumptions used are appropriate however actual experience may differ in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the companys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the companys principal us defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 

as of september 30 2019  the us pension plans were underfunded by 202 million in total including unfunded plans totaling 211 million  the nonus plans were underfunded by 300 million  including unfunded plans totaling 311 million  the company contributed a total of 60 million to defined benefit plans in 2019 and expects to contribute approximately 60 million in 2020  at yearend 2019  the discount rate for us plans was 322 percent  and was 426 percent in 2018  the assumed investment return on plan assets was 700 percent in 2019  700 percent in 2018 and 725 percent in 2017  and is expected to be 675 percent for 2020  deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were 13 billion 10 billion aftertax as of september 30 2019  see notes 11 and 12 

contingent liabilities 

the company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims including those involving general and product liability including asbestos and other matters several of which claim substantial amounts of damages the company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs including legal fees and expenses will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated accruals are based on developments to date managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters and the companys experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters the company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims including defense costs as well as its related insurance receivables the reserve for asbestos litigation which is recorded on an undiscounted basis is based on projected claims through 2065 

although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters the company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters while the company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the company see note 13 

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act which made comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws by moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime as a result cash repatriated to the us is generally no longer subject to us federal income taxes no provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14

in january 2017 the fasb issued updates to asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  eliminating the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill instead goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value these updates are effective prospectively for impairment tests beginning in fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted 

in august 2018 the fasb issued updates to asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software these updates are effective either prospectively or retrospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted and are not expected to materially impact the companys results of operations 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asc 326 financial instruments  credit losses  which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forwardlooking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments including trade receivables the new standard is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the new standard on its financial statements

competition

the information set forth under item 1a  “risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2018  and in past years we have made various acquisitions including the valves  controls business in 2017 and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the 

success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulations in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales both in the us and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies and currency fluctuations 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products globally with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets we expect sales in nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales our us and international operations subject the company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world including those related to trade investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade trade restrictions or barriers tariffs or taxes including on imports from countries where we manufacture products could adversely impact our business and financial results in addition changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in the past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions and incur higher costs if our restructuring actions are not sufficiently effective we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results in addition these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets 

changes in tax rates laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could adversely impact our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities the company’s effective tax rate cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof for example on december 22 2017 the us government enacted tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” which made comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws by moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime the changes made by the act are broad and complex as such the final onetime deemed repatriation tax may differ materially from the company’s provisional amounts due to additional regulatory guidance expected to be issued changes in interpretations or any legislative actions to address questions arising from the act as well as further evaluation of the companys actions assumptions and interpretations in addition the company’s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by us and nonus tax authorities while we believe our tax provisions are appropriate the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could adversely affect our financial results 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance the failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company relies on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally the company collects and stores certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations which are potentially conflicting and customerimposed controls these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components power outages telecommunications or system failures terrorist attacks natural disasters employee error or malfeasance server or cloud provider breaches and computer viruses or cyberattacks cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its thirdparty service providers despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period up to and including several years in addition it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades its enterprise resource planning software and related systems across a majority of its businesses should the company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation liability or penalties under privacy laws increased cybersecurity protection costs reputational damage and product failure 

our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized and a major product failure or similar event caused by defects cybersecurity incidents or other failures could adversely affect our business reputation financial position and results of operations 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leadingedge technology including both hardware and software many of our products and services including measurement and analytical instrumentation industrial valves and equipment and process control systems are integrated and used in complex process hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments as a result the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant while we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems including through manufacturing or design defects process or other failures of contractors or thirdparty suppliers cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to thirdparty claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability including asbestos and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions other acquisitions or divestitures us tax reform changes in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments costs impacts of the strategic portfolio repositioning actions and other acquisitions or divestitures impacts of us tax reform or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the company’s cash generating capabilities and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the companys ability to support its dividend after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend us gaap measure operating cash flow operating cash flow as a percent of net sales dividends as a percent of operating cash flow

cost of sales for 2018  were 99 billion  an increase of 11 billion  compared with 89 billion  in 2017  the increase is primarily due to acquisitions higher volume and the impact of foreign currency translation gross profit was 75 billion  in 2018  compared to 64 billion  in 2017  gross margin increased 09 percentage points to 429 percent  reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions partially offset by the impact of acquisitions gross profit margin was 420 percent  in 2017  

cost of sales for 2017  were 89 billion  an increase of 600 million  compared with 83 billion  in 2016  the increase reflects the acquisition of the valves  controls business and higher volume partially offset by cost reduction actions and the impact of foreign currency translation gross profit was 64 billion  in 2017  compared with 63 billion  in 2016  gross margin of 420 percent  reflected dilution of 12 percentage points due to the valves  controls operations and first year acquisition accounting charges of 74 million related to inventory slightly lower price also contributed to the decline while savings from cost reduction actions partially offset these decreases gross margin was 431 percent  in 2016  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses of 43 billion  in 2018  increased 640 million  compared with 2017  due to acquisitions and an increase in volume sga as a percent of sales of 245 percent  increased 08 percentage points due to higher incentive stock compensation of 106 million  reflecting an increase in the companys stock price and progress toward achieving its performance objectives the impact of acquisitions and higher investment spending in automation solutions partially offset by leverage on higher volume 

sga expenses of 36 billion  in 2017  increased 154 million  compared with 2016  primarily due to the valves  controls acquisition savings from cost reduction actions and lower incentive stock compensation of 35 million  reflecting the impact of changes in the stock price were partially offset by higher other costs sga as a percent of sales of 237 percent  decreased 01 percentage points in 2017  compared with 2016  

other deductions net 

other deductions net were 376 million  in 2018  an increase of 90 million  compared with 2017  the increase primarily reflects higher intangibles amortization of 75 million due to acquisitions and higher acquisitiondivestiture costs of 18 million partially offset by lower restructuring expense of 13 million  see note 5 

other deductions net were 286 million  in 2017  a decrease of 8 million  compared with 2016  the decrease primarily reflects favorable foreign currency transactions comparisons of 78 million  unfavorable in the prior year and lower restructuring expense of 18 million  these decreases were substantially offset by intangibles and backlog amortization related to the valves  controls acquisition of 29 million and 19 million respectively and higher 

  

acquisitiondivestiture costs of 24 million  additionally 2016 results included a 21 million gain from payments received related to dumping duties 

interest expense net 

interest expense net was 159 million  165 million  and 188 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decreases in 2018 and 2017 reflect the maturity of longterm debt with relatively higher interest rates and higher interest income 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” which made comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws by moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime the act includes a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent  to 21 percent  in calendar year 2018 along with the elimination of certain deductions and credits and a onetime “deemed repatriation” of accumulated foreign earnings during 2018 the company recognized a net tax benefit of 189 million 030 per share due to impacts of the act consisting of a 94 million benefit on revaluation of net deferred income tax liabilities to the lower tax rate 35 million of expense for the tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and withholding taxes and the reversal of 130 million accrued in previous periods for the planned repatriation of nonus cash 

on august 1 2018 the us treasury and internal revenue service released proposed regulations relating to the onetime tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings the proposed regulations were subject to a 60day comment period and final regulations are expected to be issued after consideration of comments received the company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed regulations and anticipates finalizing its provisional estimates after fully evaluating the final regulations 

the changes made by the act are broad and complex as such the final onetime deemed repatriation tax may differ materially from these provisional amounts due to additional regulatory guidance expected to be issued changes in interpretations or any legislative actions to address questions arising from the act as well as further evaluation of the company’s actions assumptions and interpretations 

income taxes were 443 million  660 million  and 697 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively resulting in effective tax rates of 17 percent  28 percent  and 30 percent  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the 11 percentage point decrease in 2018 versus the prior year is due to the impacts of the act which include the net tax benefit described above and the lower tax rate on 2018 earnings the 2018 and 2017 rates also include benefits from restructuring of subsidiaries of 53 million 008 per share and 47 million 007 per share respectively

net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2017  were 15 billion  down 7 percent  compared with 2016  and diluted earnings per share were 235  down 7 percent  these results include the impact of discontinued operations discussed above which negatively impacted net earnings and earnings per share comparisons 10 and 11 percentage points respectively 

return on common stockholders equity net earnings attributable to common stockholders divided by average common stockholders equity was 249 percent  in 2018  compared with 186 percent  in 2017  and 209 percent  in 2016  return on total capital was 206 percent  in 2018  compared with 153 percent  in 2017  and 155 percent  in 2016  computed as net earnings attributable to common stockholders excluding aftertax net interest expense divided by average common stockholders equity plus short and longterm debt less cash and shortterm investments the impacts of us tax reform discussed above benefited the 2018 return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital while the acquisition of the valves  controls business reduced the 2017 returns discontinued operations reduced returns in both 2017 and 2016 

business segments 

following is an analysis of segment results for 2018  compared with 2017  and 2017  compared with 2016  the company defines segment earnings as earnings before interest and income taxes in connection with the strategic portfolio repositioning actions completed in fiscal 2017 the company began reporting three segments automation solutions and climate technologies and tools  home products which together comprise the commercial  residential solutions business see note 18 





2018   vs   2017   automation solutions reported sales of 114 billion  in 2018  an increase of 20 billion  or 21 percent  underlying sales increased 10 percent   922 million  on higher volume acquisitions added 10 percent   978 million  and foreign currency translation added 1 percent   123 million  sales for measurement  analytical instrumentation increased 534 million  or 17 percent  and process control systems  solutions increased 121 million  or 6 percent  due to increased spending by global oil and gas customers strong mro demand and growth of small and midsized projects focused on facility expansion and optimization the acquisition of paradigm 113 million also supported measurement  analytical instrumentation sales valves actuators  regulators increased 11 billion  or 41 percent  led by the valves  controls acquisition 771 million and broadbased demand across end markets including energy power and life sciences industrial solutions sales increased 267 million  or 16 percent  driven by favorable global trends in general industrial end markets underlying sales increased 14 percent  in the us 1 percent  in europe and 11 percent  in asia china up 21 percent  latin america increased 4 percent  canada increased 14 percent  and middle eastafrica was up 9 percent  earnings of 19 billion  increased 364 

million  from the prior year on higher volume and leverage cost reduction savings and lower restructuring expense of 22 million  partially offset by higher investment spending margin increased 03 percentage points to 165 percent  these results reflect a dilutive impact on comparisons from the valves  controls acquisition of 12 percentage points which included an impact from higher intangibles amortization of 04 percentage points or 45 million in 2019 growth in automation solutions will continue to be driven by mro activity as well as brownfield capital investments in existing assets to expand capacity or to improve the efficiency safety and uptime of those facilities steady progress in greenfield capital projects across upstream midstream infrastructure natural gas chemical and hybrid markets including life sciences and food and beverage is also expected with orders weighted toward the second half of 2019 

2017   vs   2016   automation solutions reported sales of 94 billion  in 2017  an increase of 441 million  or 5 percent  underlying sales decreased 1 percent   128 million  on lower volume and slightly lower price the valves  controls acquisition added 7 percent   603 million  while foreign currency translation subtracted 1 percent   34 million  sales for measurement  analytical instrumentation decreased 2 percent  and process control systems  solutions decreased 4 percent  due to weakness in energyrelated markets but began to improve in the second half of the year as oil prices stabilized valves actuators  regulators increased 531 million  or 25 percent  due to the valves  controls acquisition industrial solutions sales increased 59 million  or 4 percent  on improving economic conditions and industrial end markets especially automotive chemical power and life sciences were favorable underlying sales increased 1 percent  in the us were down 2 percent  in europe and increased 1 percent  in asia china up 9 percent  latin america decreased 20 percent  canada decreased 6 percent  and middle eastafrica was down 6 percent  earnings of 15 billion  increased 66 million  from the prior year savings from cost reduction actions and favorable foreign currency transactions comparisons of 64 million unfavorable in the prior year were partially offset by lower volume and 25 million of restructuring expense and 29 million of intangibles amortization related to the valves  controls acquisition materials cost containment offset lower price margin was flat primarily reflecting the benefit from cost reduction actions offset by dilution from the valves  controls acquisition of 15 percentage points 



2018   vs   2017   commercial  residential solutions sales were 60 billion  in 2018  an increase of 125 million  or 2 percent  underlying sales increased 4 percent   226 million  on higher volume and slightly higher price foreign currency translation added 1 percent   58 million  while the divestiture of the residential storage business net of acquisitions subtracted 3 percent   159 million  climate technologies sales were 45 billion  in 2018  an increase of 242 million  or 6 percent  global hvac sales were up moderately reflecting robust growth in china while sales were up moderately in europe and modestly in the us cold chain sales were strong led by robust growth in china and solid growth in europe while sales in the us were up slightly sensors had strong growth while temperature controls was flat tools  home products sales were 15 billion  in 2018  down 117 million  or 7 percent  compared to the prior year reflecting the impact of the residential storage divestiture  298 million  sales for professional tools were strong on favorable demand in oil and gas and constructionrelated markets and the tools and test acquisition added 106 million  wetdry vacuums had solid growth and food waste disposers were up slightly overall underlying sales increased 3 percent  in the us 4 percent  in europe and 9 percent  in asia china up 11 percent  sales increased 4 percent  in both latin america and canada while sales decreased 8 percent  in 

  

middle eastafrica earnings were 14 billion  a decrease of 6 million  and margin was down 06 percentage points higher materials costs the impact of acquisitions unfavorable mix and increased restructuring expense of 11 million  were partially offset by leverage on higher volume favorable price and savings from cost reduction actions in addition the residential storage divestiture reduced earnings by 16 million but benefited margin comparisons 10 percentage points while higher warranty costs of 10 million associated with a specific product issue in climate technologies partially offset this benefit commercial  residential solutions growth in 2019 will be supported by continued strong demand in residential and commercial air conditioning markets in the us as well as cold chain and professional tools demand in the us asia and europe 

2017   vs   2016   commercial  residential solutions sales were 59 billion  in 2017  an increase of 302 million  or 5 percent  reflecting favorable conditions in hvac and refrigeration markets in the us asia and europe as well as us and asian construction markets underlying sales increased 5 percent   297 million  on 6 percent higher volume partially offset by 1 percent lower price foreign currency translation deducted 20 million  and acquisitions added 25 million  climate technologies sales were 42 billion  in 2017  an increase of 268 million  or 7 percent  global air conditioning sales were solid led by strength in the us and asia and robust growth in china partially due to easier comparisons while sales were up modestly in europe and declined moderately in middle eastafrica global refrigeration sales were strong reflecting robust growth in china on increased adoption of energyefficient solutions and slight growth in the us sensors and solutions had strong growth while temperature controls was up modestly tools  home products sales were 16 billion  in 2017  up 34 million  compared to the prior year professional tools had strong growth on favorable demand from oil and gas customers and in other constructionrelated markets wetdry vacuums sales were up moderately as favorable conditions continued in us construction markets food waste disposers increased slightly while the storage business declined moderately overall underlying sales increased 3 percent  in the us 4 percent  in europe and 17 percent  in asia china up 27 percent  sales increased 3 percent  in latin america and 4 percent  in canada while sales decreased 5 percent  in middle eastafrica earnings were 14 billion  an increase of  72 million  driven by climate technologies while margin was flat increased volume and resulting leverage savings from cost reduction actions and lower customer accommodation costs of 16 million were largely offset by higher materials costs lower price and unfavorable product mix 

financial position capital resources and liquidity 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and has the resources available to reinvest for growth in existing businesses pursue strategic acquisitions and manage its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 



operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2018  was 29 billion  a 202 million  or 8 percent  increase compared with 2017  primarily due to higher earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital investment to support higher levels of sales activity and income taxes paid on the residential storage divestiture operating cash flow from continuing operations of 27 billion  in 2017  increased 8 percent  compared to 25 billion  in 2016  reflecting higher earnings and favorable changes in working capital at september 30 2018  operating working capital as a percent of sales was 57 percent  compared with 66 percent  in 2017  and 52 percent  in 2016  the increase in 2017 was due to higher levels of working capital in the acquired valves  controls business operating cash flow from continuing operations funded capital expenditures of 617 million  dividends of 12 billion  and common stock purchases of 10 billion  in 2018 the company repatriated 14 billion of cash held by nonus 

  

subsidiaries which was part of the companys previously announced plans these funds along with increased shortterm borrowings and divestiture proceeds supported acquisitions of 22 billion  contributions to pension plans were 61 million  in 2018  45 million  in 2017  and 66 million  in 2016  

capital expenditures related to continuing operations were 617 million  476 million  and 447 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively free cash flow from continuing operations operating cash flow less capital expenditures was 23 billion  in 2018  up 3 percent  free cash flow was 22 billion  in 2017  compared with 21 billion  in 2016  the company is targeting capital spending of approximately 650 million in 2019  net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was 22 billion  30 billion  and 132 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively proceeds from divestitures not classified as discontinued operations were 201 million  and 39 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively 

dividends were 12 billion   194  per share in 2018  compared with 12 billion   192  per share in 2017  and 12 billion   190  per share in 2016  in november 2018  the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 1 percent to an annualized rate of 196 per share 

purchases of emerson common stock totaled 10 billion  400 million  and 601 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively at average per share prices of 6625 6051 and 4811 

the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million common shares in november 2015 and 418 million shares remain available for purchase under this authorization the company purchased 151 million shares in 2018  66 million shares in 2017 and 125 million shares in 2016 under this authorization and the remainder of the may 2013 authorization 



total debt which includes longterm debt current maturities of longterm debt commercial paper and other shortterm borrowings was 48 billion  47 billion  and 66 billion for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively during the year the company repaid 250 million  of 5375  notes that matured in october 2017 in 2017 and 2016 respectively the company repaid 250 million of 5125 notes that matured in december 2016 and 250 million of 475 notes which matured in october 2015 

  

the net debttonet capital ratio less cash and shortterm investments increased in 2018  due to a decrease in cash which was used for acquisitions during the year in 2017  the total debttocapital ratio and the net debttonet capital ratio less cash and shortterm investments decreased due to lower total debt outstanding and higher common stockholders equity from changes in other comprehensive income the operating cash flow from continuing operationstodebt ratio increased in 2018  primarily due to higher cash flow in the current year the operating cash flow from continuing operationstodebt ratio increased in 2017 primarily due to lower total debt outstanding the interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus interest expense divided by interest expense the increase in interest coverage in 2018  reflects higher earnings in the current year the increase in interest coverage in 2017  reflects lower interest expense 

in may 2018 the company entered into a 35 billion fiveyear revolving backup credit facility with various banks which replaced the april 2014 35 billion facility the credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes including commercial paper borrowings the company has not incurred any borrowings under this or 

  

previous facilities the credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes the facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the company’s option fees to maintain the facility are immaterial the company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which it can issue debt securities preferred stock common stock warrants share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 

emersons financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives the company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations complete acquisitions and sustain longterm growth at september 30 2018  approximately 11 billion of the companys cash was held outside the us primarily in europe and asia the company routinely repatriates a portion of its nonus cash from earnings each year or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently and provides for foreign withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes as appropriate the company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet the companys needs in the foreseeable future through operating cash flow existing resources short and longterm debt capacity or backup credit lines 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2018  the companys contractual obligations including estimated payments are as follows 



purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements the table above does not include 21 billion  of other noncurrent liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and summarized in note 19 which consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits because it is not certain when these amounts will become due see notes 11 and 12 for estimated future benefit payments and note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes 

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 8 through 10 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes a large majority of its revenue through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collection is reasonably assured in certain circumstances revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method as performance occurs or in accordance with asc 985605 related to software sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements which requires management judgment that affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized in these instances the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendorspecific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price revenue is recognized for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and performance related to the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the companys control or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment the vast majority of deliverables are tangible products with a smaller portion attributable to installation service or maintenance management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations 

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases management believes the assumptions used are appropriate however actual experience may differ in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the companys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016 the principal us defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured current employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 affected employees transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution plan see notes 11 and 12 

during 2018 the funded status of the companys pension plans improved by 407 million  as of september 30 2018  the us pension plans were overfunded by 276 million  in total including unfunded plans totaling 182 million  the nonus plans were underfunded by 199 million  including unfunded plans totaling 270 million  the company contributed a total of 61 million  to defined benefit plans in 2018  and expects to contribute approximately 60 million  in 2019  at yearend 2018  the discount rate for us plans was 426 percent  and was 376 percent  in 2017  the assumed investment return on plan assets was 700 percent  in 2018  725 percent  in 2017  and 750 percent  in 2016  and is expected to be 700 percent for 2019  deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were 712 million  531 million aftertax as of september 30 2018  

contingent liabilities 

the company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims including those involving general and product liability including asbestos and other matters several of which claim substantial amounts of damages the company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs including legal fees and expenses will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated accruals are based on developments to date managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters the companys experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters and any related insurance coverage although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters the company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims 

  

and suits that have been brought against it and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters while the company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the company see note 13 

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act which made comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws by moving from a global to a modified territorial tax regime as a result cash repatriated to the us is generally no longer subject to us federal income taxes no provision is made for foreign withholding taxes and any applicable us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries where these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14 

other items 

legal matters 

at september 30 2018  there were no known contingent liabilities including guarantees pending litigation taxes and other claims that management believes will be material in relation to the companys financial statements nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  to update and consolidate revenue recognition guidance from multiple sources into a single comprehensive standard to be applied for all contracts with customers the fundamental principle of the revised standard is to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services also required are additional disclosures regarding the nature extent timing and uncertainty of revenues and associated cash flows the company adopted the new standard as of october 1 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method the cumulative effect of adoption to be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is expected to result in an immaterial increase to retained earnings further the updates are not expected to materially impact the companys financial statements in fiscal 2019 the company is in the process of finalizing changes to its business processes systems controls and accounting policies to support recognition and disclosure under the new guidance

 item 1a  risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

our proposed acquisition of rockwell automation inc may not be completed or completed on the terms and conditions contemplated or with the expected benefits 

we are currently pursuing a potential acquisition of rockwell automation inc rockwell has not engaged with the company on this or previous proposals if the proposed transaction were to proceed we can make no assurance as to the completion terms timing costs or benefits anticipated from any such acquisition the acquisition would involve increases in the companys debt levels and outstanding shares unforeseen developments including delays in obtaining various tax regulatory and other approvals could delay any acquisition or cause it to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable or at a higher cost than expected in addition the company may encounter difficulties in integration and may not realize the degree or timing of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2017  and in past years we have made various acquisitions including the valves  controls business and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we 

monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulation in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales both in the us and abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in local government regulations and policies and foreign currency fluctuations 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products globally with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets we expect sales in nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales our us and international operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results in addition changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in the past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions and incur higher costs if our restructuring actions are not sufficiently effective we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results in addition these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance the failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses despite the implementation of extensive security measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattack and other events ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats although considered unlikely it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation increased cybersecurity protection costs and reputational damage 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

this annual report on form 10k contains various forwardlooking statements and includes assumptions concerning emersons operations future results and prospects these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under item 1a  “risk factors” which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic political and technological factors among others changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forwardlooking statements and related assumptions 

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions other acquisitions or divestitures changes in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments costs impacts of the strategic portfolio repositioning actions or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the company’s cash generating capabilities and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the companys ability to support its dividend after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend us gaap measure operating cash flow operating cash flow as a percent of net sales dividends as a percent of operating cash flow

dividends were 1239 million   192  per share in 2017  compared with 1227 million   190  per share in 2016  and 1269 million   188  per share in 2015  in november 2017  the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 1 percent to an annualized rate of 194 per share

the total debttocapital ratio and the net debttonet capital ratio less cash and shortterm investments decreased in 2017  due to lower total debt outstanding and higher common stockholders equity from changes in other comprehensive income the total debttocapital ratio and the net debttonet capital ratio less cash and shortterm investments increased in 2016  due to lower common stockholders equity from share repurchases and changes in other comprehensive income the operating cash flow from continuing operationstodebt ratio increased in 2017  primarily due to lower debt in the current year the operating cash flow from continuing operationstodebt ratio increased in 2016 primarily due to taxes paid in 2015 on the divestiture gains and lower debt in 2016 the interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus interest expense divided by interest expense the increase in interest coverage in 2017  reflects lower interest expense in the current year the decrease in interest coverage in 2016  reflects lower pretax earnings largely due to the divestiture gains of 1039 million in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense 

in april 2014 the company entered into a 35 billion fiveyear revolving backup credit facility with various banks which replaced the december 2010 275 billion facility the credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes including commercial paper borrowing the company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities the credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes the facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the companys option fees to maintain the facility are immaterial the company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which it can issue debt securities preferred stock common stock warrants share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size price and terms to be determined at the time of sale

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2017  the companys contractual obligations including estimated payments are as follows 



purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements the table above does not include 20 billion  of other noncurrent liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and summarized in note 19 which consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities deferred income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits because it is not certain when these amounts will become due see notes 11 and 12 for estimated future benefit payments and note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes 

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 8 through 10 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes a large majority of its revenue through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collection is reasonably assured in certain circumstances revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method as performance occurs or in accordance with asc 985605 related to software sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements which requires management judgment that affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized in these instances the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendorspecific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price revenue is recognized for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and performance related to the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the companys control or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment the vast majority of deliverables are tangible products with a smaller portion attributable to installation service or maintenance management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the majority of inventory is valued based on standard costs which approximate average costs while the remainder is principally valued on a firstin firstout basis cost standards are revised at the beginning of each year the annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating 

  

variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold the companys businesses review inventory for obsolescence make appropriate provisions and dispose of obsolete inventory on a regular basis various factors are considered in these reviews including sales history and recent trends industry conditions and general economic conditions if actual circumstances indicate a decline in any of these factors particularly an abrupt change in economic conditions the company could incur higher levels of obsolescence expense 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations 

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases management believes the assumptions used are appropriate however actual experience may differ in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the companys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016 the principal us defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured current employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 affected employees transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution plan see notes 11 and 12 

during 2017 the funded status of the companys pension plans improved by 667 million as of september 30 2017  the us pension plans were underfunded by 77 million  in total including unfunded plans totaling 201 million  the nonus plans were underfunded by 253 million  including unfunded plans totaling 215 million  the company contributed a total of 45 million  to defined benefit plans in 2017  and expects to contribute approximately 60 million  in 2018  at yearend 2017  the discount rate for us plans was 376 percent  and was 350 percent  in 2016  the assumed investment return on plan assets was 725 percent  in 2017  and 750 percent  in 2016  and 2015  and is expected to be 70 percent for 2018 deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were 1161 million  753 million aftertax as of september 30 2017  

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained 

  

upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

the company also pays us federal income taxes net of available foreign tax credits on cash repatriated from nonus locations no provision is made for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries where these earnings are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14

the information set forth under item 1a  risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

our strategic portfolio transactions including the planned sales of our network power systems business and our power generation motors and drives businesses as well as the planned acquisition of pentairs valves  controls business may not be completed within the currently contemplated time frame with the expected terms or costs and may not achieve the intended benefits 

we make no assurance regarding the terms timing costs or benefits anticipated from the strategic portfolio transactions unforeseen developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax regulatory and other approvals could delay the proposed transactions or cause them to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable or at a higher cost than expected 

further we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial or other benefits of the strategic portfolio transactions moreover after the transactions are completed the company will be smaller and less diversified with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could adversely affect our business 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment including capital and consumer spending a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the 

number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures which are subject to domestic and foreign regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures these activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions in 2016 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws policies and regulation in host countries as well as economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities these facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets and a significant portion of our sales occur in mature and emerging markets outside the united states we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in the past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions and incur higher costs if our restructuring actions are not sufficiently effective we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results in addition these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

our business success depends on the ability to attract develop and retain key personnel 

our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees their skills experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance the failure to attract develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses despite the implementation of extensive security measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattack and other events ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats although considered unlikely it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation increased cybersecurity protection costs and reputational damage 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under sec rules to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as our strategic repositioning actions other acquisitions or divestitures changes in reporting segments gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments costs associated with the strategic portfolio repositioning actions or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is 

useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash us gaap measure operating cash flow

air conditioning sales were down while global refrigeration sales were up modestly as the us exhibited growth and europe and china were down with more significant declines in air conditioning sales of temperature controls sensors and solutions decreased overall underlying sales were up 1 percent  in the us and 2 percent  in europe while asia was down 5 percent  latin america was down 1 percent  and middle eastafrica and canada were both down 2 percent  earnings of 769 million  increased 71 million  and margin increased 21  percentage points primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment partially offset by lower price and higher customer accommodation costs sales growth in the low singledigits is expected for fiscal 2017 supported by a favorable outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration 

2015   vs   2014   sales for climate technologies were 40 billion in 2015 a decrease of 98 million or over 2 percent due to unfavorable foreign currency translation 112 million underlying sales were up slightly 14 million as an increase in the global refrigeration business was essentially offset by a decrease in air conditioning the temperature controls and sensors businesses were flat air conditioning sales in the us europe and china decreased while the rest of the world had strong growth global refrigeration was up modestly with growth in the us and asia and weakness in europe overall underlying sales were flat in the us down 2 percent in asia china down 12 percent and decreased 1 percent in europe latin america was down 4 percent middle eastafrica was up 26 percent and canada increased 13 percent earnings of 698 million decreased 39 million and margin declined 05 percentage points primarily due to unfavorable mix growth investments and higher restructuring costs and unfavorable foreign currency transactions of 6 million each were more than offset by cost reduction savings

2015   vs   2014   commercial  residential solutions sales were 19 billion in 2015 an increase of 22 million or 1 percent underlying sales increased 2 percent 50 million on higher volume from favorable us construction markets while foreign currency translation deducted 1 percent 28 million the sales increase was led by strong growth in wetdry vacuums and modest growth in food waste disposers the professional tools and commercial storage businesses decreased underlying sales were up 3 percent in the us and 1 percent internationally earnings of 403 million were down 18 million and margin declined 12 percentage points as higher volume and resulting leverage was more than offset by unfavorable mix higher restructuring costs of 9 million  and investments in growth programs 

financial position capital resources and liquidity 

the company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and has the resources available to reinvest for growth in existing businesses pursue strategic acquisitions and manage its capital structure on a short and longterm basis 



the company generated total operating cash flow of 29 billion  in 2016 which was reduced by payments of 179 million for separation costs related to the portfolio repositioning operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2016 was 25 billion  a 459 million  or 23 percent  increase compared with 2015  as comparisons benefited from income taxes of 424 million paid in the prior year on the divestiture gains operating cash flow from continuing operations of 20 billion  in 2015  was a 32 percent  decrease compared to 30 billion  in 2014  due to income taxes paid on the gains from divestitures in 2015 an increase in operating working capital and lower earnings excluding the divestiture gains at september 30 2016  operating working capital as a percent of sales improved to 52 percent  compared with 72 percent  and 59 percent  in 2015  and 2014  respectively total operating cash flow of 29 billion funded capital expenditures of 523 million  including discontinued operations repayments of longterm debt of 254 million  acquisitions of 132 million  dividends of 1227 million  and common stock purchases of 601 million  in 2016 contributions to pension plans were 66 million  in 2016  53 million  in 2015  and 130 million  in 2014  

capital expenditures related to continuing operations were 447 million  588 million  and 651 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively free cash flow from continuing operations operating cash flow less capital expenditures was 21 billion  in 2016  up 41 percent  reflecting higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures free cash flow was 15 billion  in 2015  compared with 23 billion  in 2014  reflecting higher operating cash flow in 2014 the company is targeting capital spending of approximately 500 million in 2017  net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was 132 million  324 million  and 610 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively in 2014 the company also purchased the noncontrolling interest in appleton group for 574 million proceeds from divestitures were 1812 million  and 363 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

dividends were 1227 million   190  per share in 2016  compared with 1269 million   188  per share in 2015  and 1210 million   172  per share in 2014  in november 2016 the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 1 percent to an annualized rate of 192 per share 

purchases of emerson common stock totaled 601 million  2487 million  and 971 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively at average per share prices of 4811 5768 and 6554 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million common shares in november 2015 and 635 million shares remain available for purchase under this authorization the company purchased 125 million shares in 2016  under a combination of the november 2015 authorization and the remainder of the may 2013 authorization a total of 431 million shares were purchased in 2015  and 148 million shares were purchased in 2014 both under the may 2013 authorization 

the sale of the network power systems business and power generation motors and drives businesses will provide over 4 billion of cash after tax which the company expects to use to fund the acquisition of pentairs valves  controls business and potential future acquisitions 



total debt which includes longterm debt current maturities of longterm debt commercial paper and other shortterm borrowings was 66 billion  68 billion  and 60 billion for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively during the year the company repaid 250 million  of 475  notes that matured in october 2015 in 2015 the company issued 500 million of 2625 notes due december 2021 and 500 million of 3150 notes due june 2025 and repaid 250 million of 50 notes that matured in december 2014 and 250 million of 4125 notes that matured in april 2015 in 2014 the company repaid 250 million of 5625 notes that matured in november 2013 

  

the total debttocapital ratio and the net debttonet capital ratio less cash and shortterm investments increased in 2016 due to lower common stockholders equity from share repurchases and changes in other comprehensive income the total debttocapital ratio and the net debttonet capital ratio increased in 2015 primarily due to higher total debt from the issuance of longterm debt and lower common stockholders equity the operating cash flow from continuing operationstodebt ratio increased in 2016  primarily due to taxes paid in the prior year on the divestiture gains and lower debt in the current year the interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus interest expense divided by interest expense the decrease in interest coverage in 2016 reflects lower pretax earnings largely due to the divestiture gains of 1039 million in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense the increase in interest coverage in 2015 reflects higher pretax earnings including the divestiture gains and lower interest expense 

in april 2014 the company entered into a 35 billion fiveyear revolving backup credit facility with various banks which replaced the december 2010 275 billion facility the credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes including commercial paper borrowing the company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities the credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes the facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate and currency denomination alternatives at the companys option fees to maintain the facility are immaterial the company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which it can issue debt securities preferred stock common stock warrants share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 

emersons financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives the company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations complete acquisitions and sustain longterm growth at september 30 2016  29 billion of the companys cash was held outside the us primarily in europe and asia and was generally available for repatriation to the us under current tax law repatriated cash may be subject to us federal income taxes net of available foreign tax credits the company routinely repatriates a portion of its nonus cash from earnings each year or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently and provides for us income taxes as appropriate the company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet the companys needs in the foreseeable future through operating cash flow existing resources short and longterm debt capacity or backup credit lines 

contractual obligations 

at september 30 2016  the companys contractual obligations including estimated payments are as follows 



purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements total purchase and operating lease obligations related to discontinued operations which are not included in the table above were 251 million and 193 million respectively at september 30 2016 these obligations will be transferred to the buyers at closing the table above does not include 17 billion  of other noncurrent liabilities recorded in the balance sheet and summarized in note 19 which consist primarily of pension and postretirement plan liabilities and deferred income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits because it is not certain when these amounts will become due see notes 11 and 12 for estimated future benefit payments and note 14 for additional information on deferred income taxes 

financial instruments 

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates and selectively uses derivative financial instruments including forwards swaps and purchased options to manage these risks the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes the value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the us dollar across all currencies the potential losses in future earnings fair value or cash flows are not material sensitivity analysis has limitations for example a weaker us dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of nonus operating results and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales see notes 1 and 8 through 10 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue expenses assets liabilities and equity note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements the most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes nearly all revenue through the sale of manufactured products and records the sale when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collection is reasonably assured in certain limited circumstances revenue is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method as performance occurs or in accordance with asc 985605 related to software sales arrangements sometimes involve delivering multiple elements which requires management judgment that affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized in these instances the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendorspecific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or a management estimate of the relative selling price revenue is recognized for delivered elements if they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and performance related to the undelivered items is probable and substantially in the companys control or the undelivered elements are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingencies related to payment the vast majority of deliverables are tangible products with a smaller portion attributable to installation service or maintenance management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing revenue 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the majority of inventory values are based on standard costs which approximate average costs while the remainder are principally valued on a firstin firstout basis cost standards are revised at the beginning of each year the annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold the companys businesses review inventory for obsolescence make appropriate provisions and dispose of obsolete inventory on a regular basis various factors are considered in these reviews including sales history and recent trends industry conditions and general economic conditions if actual circumstances indicate a decline in any of these factors particularly an abrupt change in economic conditions the company could incur higher levels of obsolescence expense 

longlived assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its estimated fair value reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the units estimated fair value to its carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimates of future sales operating results cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment including such factors as the general level of market interest rates expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable however changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the evaluations 

retirement plans 

the company maintains a prudent longterm investment strategy for its pension assets consistent with the duration of its pension obligations the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however actual experience may differ in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles actual results that differ from the companys assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods the company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans in 2016 the principal us defined benefit plan closed to employees hired after january 1 2016 while shortertenured current employees ceased accruing benefits effective october 1 2016 affected employees transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution plan see notes 11 and 12 

as of september 30 2016  the companys us pension plans were underfunded by 586 million  and nonus plans were underfunded by 411 million  the us funded status includes unfunded plans totaling 216 million  and the nonus status includes unfunded plans totaling 237 million  the company contributed a total of 66 million  to defined benefit plans in 2016  and expects to contribute 40 million  in 2017  at yearend 2016  the discount rate for us plans was 350 percent  and was 435 percent  in 2015  the assumed investment return on plan assets was 750 percent  in 2016  2015  and 2014  and is expected to be 725 percent for 2017 deferred actuarial losses to be amortized to expense in future years were 1916 million  1248 million aftertax as of september 30 2016  

income taxes 

income tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid received on items included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 

uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination along with positions expected to be taken in future returns the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits based on the technical merits when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit changes in applicable tax laws including tax case rulings and legislative guidance or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 

the company also pays us federal income taxes net of available foreign tax credits on cash repatriated from nonus locations no provision is made for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries where these earnings are considered permanently invested or otherwise indefinitely retained for continuing international operations determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable see notes 1 and 14

in may 2015 the fasb issued updates to asc 820 fair value measurement  requiring investments measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient to be removed from the fair value hierarchy and separately reported when making disclosures the updates have no impact on operations and do not change the determination of fair value for any investments these updates are effective for the company in fiscal 2017 and must be adopted on a retrospective basis adoption will affect disclosure only there will be no impact on the company’s financial results 

fiscal 2017 outlook

the information set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

8  

our proposed strategic portfolio transactions including the planned spinoff of our network power systems business may not be completed within the currently contemplated time frame with the expected terms or costs or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

we make no assurance that the spinoff or any other potential transactions will occur nor can we provide assurance regarding the terms timing costs or benefits anticipated unforeseen developments including possible delays in obtaining various tax regulatory and other approvals could delay or prevent the proposed spinoff or other potential transactions from occurring or cause them to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable or at a higher cost than expected moreover we may further revise our plans with respect to one or more of these transactions executing the proposed spinoff will require significant time and attention from management which could impact operations in our other businesses 

even if one or more transactions are completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial or other benefits moreover if the spinoff is consummated the two independent companies will each be smaller and less diversified with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could adversely affect our business as well as that of the spunoff company there may also be a loss of synergies from separating the businesses that could negatively impact the balance sheet profit margins or earnings of both businesses further the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spinoff not occurred 

  

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

  

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

  

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

9  

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions in 2015 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals the company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets and a significant portion of our sales occur in mature and emerging markets outside the united states we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

10  

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in the past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and incur higher costs if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results in addition these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses despite the implementation of extensive security measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses cyberattack and other events ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats although considered unlikely it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation increased cybersecurity protection costs and reputational damage 

  

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

 item 3  legal proceedings 

  

the company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings some of which claim substantial amounts of damages it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters but historically the company has been largely successful in both prosecuting and defending claims and lawsuits

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions divestitures gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the company’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments costs associated with the planned spinoff of the network power systems business and other strategic repositioning actions or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is 

useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash us gaap measure operating cash flow

the information set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

  

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing highquality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

  

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions in 2014 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2014 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments 

furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely a ffected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets and a significant portion of our sales occur in mature and emerging markets outside the united states we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in end markets we serve may negatively affect our operations 

in the past our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve in the future similar changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and incur higher costs if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results in addition these factors could lead to impairment charges for goodwill or other longlived assets 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results additionally if our customers suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

the company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses despite the implementation of extensive security measures including access controls data encryption vulnerability assessments continuous monitoring and maintenance of backup and protective systems the company’s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses cyber attack and other events ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats although considered unlikely it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer supplier or employee information should the company be unable to prevent security breaches disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations as well as expose the company to litigation increased cyber security protection costs and reputational damage 

  

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving intellectual property product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions divestitures gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is 

useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash us gaap measure operating cash flow

the information set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

  

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

  

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in 2013 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2013 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if our customers suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in the end markets we serve may negatively impact segment revenues and operating results 

segment revenues operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve these changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other longlived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the company’s carrying value moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

fiscal 2014 outlook 

  

global economic indicators remain mixed and uncertain but momentum appears to be on a slightly favorable trend process management orders are expected to remain solid through 2014 improvement in europe and asia is expected to support modest nearterm sales growth in industrial automation while also supporting positive nearterm order trends in the network power systems business for climate technologies residential and refrigeration strength and an expected commercial end market recovery support a moderate growth outlook solid residential end market momentum supports an outlook for modest nearterm growth in commercial  residential solutions based on a forecast of global gross fixed investment growth of 25 to 4 percent emerson underlying sales are expected to grow 3 to 5 percent in 2014 excluding 4 percent from acquisitions and the previously announced divestiture of the embedded computing and power business reported sales are expected to change 1 to 1 percent after managing costs aggressively through sluggish economic conditions the past two years incremental growth investments will accelerate next year resulting in only slight margin expansion earnings per share are expected to increase 4 to 7 percent excluding an approximate 30 percent impact from impairment and repatriation charges or increase 33 to 38 percent on a reported basisthe embedded computing and power transaction impact to 2014 earnings per share is expected to be approximately neutral as supplemental share repurchase offsets the earnings decline 

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions divestitures gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity 

and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is 

useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash us gaap measure operating cash flow

the information set forth under “item 1a  risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a  risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

  

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

  

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

if we are unable to defend or protect our intellectual property rights the companys competitive position could be adversely affected 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other confidential information this intellectual property may be subject to challenge infringement invalidation or circumvention by third parties despite extensive security measures our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems employee theft or other acts of industrial espionage should the company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property it may suffer competitive harm 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in 2012 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2012 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if our customers suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in the end markets we serve may negatively impact segment revenues and operating results 

segment revenues operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve these changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other longlived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the company’s carrying value moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

fiscal 2013 outlook 

  

orders have slowed as nearterm business investment has become more cautious and market visibility has deteriorated due to economic uncertainty in the us china and europe this has resulted in a challenging and tenuous planning environment based on current market conditions with slowing economic momentum reported and underlying sales in 2013 are expected to grow at a rate in a low singledigit range of 0 to 5 percent led by solid nearterm growth for process management supported by continued project activity in oil and gas chemical and power end markets as well as steady nearterm improvement in north america residential end markets in commercial  residential solutions end market demand is expected to be sluggish in industrial automation especially in europe and nearterm sales growth will be a challenge global market conditions for climate technologies are expected to remain uneven and generally sluggish in the near term excluding the 2012 goodwill impairment charge ebit margin is expected to improve 10 to 20 basis points which excludes 240 basis points for impairment and pretax earnings margin is expected to improve 250 to 260 basis points which would result in earnings per share growth in the midtohigh single digits from 339 in 2012 the majority of sales and earnings growth is expected to be realized in the first half of the year due in large part to the quarterly impact of the thailand flooding in 2012 

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management periodically uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions divestitures gains losses and impairments or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability ebit defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense net and income taxes and total segment ebit and ebit margin defined as ebit divided by net sales and total segment ebit margin are commonly used financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes all these measures are utilized by management to evaluate performance us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses impairments or other items provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is 

useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash us gaap measure operating cash flow

the information set forth under “item 1a risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 

 

  

  

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line some of our competitors have substantially greater sales assets and financial resources than our company and we also compete with many smaller companies competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our sales or profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in 2011 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2011 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if our customers suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

  

  

 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics rare earth metals aluminum brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers however the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states and also source certain materials internationally emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings which could adversely affect our results changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in the end markets we serve may negatively impact segment revenues and operating results 

segment revenues operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve these changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other longlived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the company’s carrying value moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results 

  

  

 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

fiscal 2012 outlook 

 

the company achieved strong sales and earnings results in 2011 and is well positioned moving into 2012 despite a weakening trend in business conditions underlying sales for fiscal year 2012 are expected to increase in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent which excludes an estimated 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation net sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 4 percent to 6 percent compared with 2011 sales of 242 billion the company also expects operating profit margin of approximately 18 percent excluding approximately 25 percent for other deductions net and interest and pretax margin of approximately 155 percent earnings per share growth is expected in the range of 8 percent to 12 percent 

process management sources electrical and electronic components for some products from areas in thailand that have suffered significant flood damage the company is implementing contingency plans and working with suppliers and customers to minimize the impact of supply disruptions these disruptions will have a nearterm impact but do not affect the fiscal year 2012 guidance announced previously and repeated above 

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap management uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions divestitures gains and losses or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability us gaap measure net sales  

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability us gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

  

  

 

earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items given the nature of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors us gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on common stockholders’ equity return on total capital  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash us gaap measure operating cash flow

the information set forth under “item 1a risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 

  

  

 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in 2010 and in past years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements of the 2010 annual report which note is hereby incorporated by reference the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if our customers suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

 

  

  

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states emerging market sales now represent over onethird of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strife war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in the end markets we serve may negatively impact segment revenues and operating results 

segment revenues operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve these changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other longlived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the company’s carrying value moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results 

  

  

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

fiscal 2011 outlook 

 

fiscal year 2010 was a challenging year but improving economic circumstances and strong operating results in the second half of the year have emerson well positioned moving into 2011 underlying sales for fiscal year 2011 are expected to increase in the range of positive 7 percent to 10 percent which excludes an estimated favorable increase of 5 percent due to completed acquisitions and foreign currency translation net sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 12 percent to 15 percent compared with 2010 sales of 21 billion the company also expects operating profit margin in the range of 172 percent to 175 percent excludes 30 percent to 28 percent for other deductions net and interest and pretax margin of 142 percent to 147 percent operating cash flow is estimated at 34 to 35 billion there can be no assurance what impact future exchange rate changes will have 

nongaap financial measures 

 

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions divestitures onetime gains and losses or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rates management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and operating performance any nongaap measure provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with us gaap as identified in italics below further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies 

 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability gaap measure net sales  

 

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability gaap measures pretax earnings or pretax profit margin  

earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding onetime gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items given the unique nature of these onetime items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors gaap measures earnings earnings per share return on equity return on total capital  

  

  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations the determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash gaap measure operating cash flow

the information set forth under “item 1a risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect the company’s ability to access those markets if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if our customers suppliers and financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the company our business could be adversely impacted 

 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations while we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to reduce price exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

recessions adverse market conditions or downturns in the end markets we serve may negatively impact segment revenues and operating results 

segment revenues operating results and cash flows have varied in the past and may be exposed to significant volatility from quarter to quarter in the future due to changes in general economic conditions recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve these changes could adversely impact overall sales operating results and cash flows which in turn could trigger impairment of goodwill or other longlived assets due to the fair value of such assets falling below the company’s carrying value moreover during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive rationalization actions and therefore incur higher rationalization expense during such periods if our rationalization actions are not sufficiently effective or if we must incur rationalization costs beyond what we anticipate we may not be able to achieve our anticipated operating results 

 

 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

information appearing under “results of operations” “financial position capital resources and liquidity” “critical accounting policies” and the safe harbor statement in the 2009 annual report are hereby incorporated by reference 

 

fiscal 2010 outlook 

 

fiscal year 2009 was a challenging year but emerson believes it is well positioned moving into the uncertain 2010 economic environment underlying sales for fiscal year 2010 are expected to decline in the range of negative 5 percent to negative 7 percent which excludes an estimated favorable increase of 7 percent to 5 percent due to foreign currency translation completed and assumed future acquisitions and potential divestitures reported sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive 2 percent to negative 2 percent compared with 2009 sales of 209 billion the company also expects the operating profit margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year there can be no assurance when or if potential future acquisitions or divestitures will be completed and what impact future exchange rate changes will have 

nongaap financial measures 

 

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management uses certain “nongaap financial measures” as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example nongaap measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions divestitures onetime gains and losses or items outside of management’s control such as foreign currency exchange rates management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and operating performance 

  

  

 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability underlying sales should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to net sales as determined in accordance with us gaap  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with us gaap 

earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding onetime gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items given the unique nature of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors however these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings earnings per share return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures although   management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

overall while emerson believes these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore they may not be comparable among companies

the information set forth under “item 1a risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the best relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

 

 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleumbased chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from non  us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our operating results while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

downturns in the end markets that we serve may negatively impact our segment revenues and profitability 

our segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

fiscal year 2008 was a record year and emerson is well positioned moving into an uncertain 2009 recessionary environment reported sales are forecast to be in the range of 235 billion to 255 billion or negative 5 percent to positive 3 percent compared to 2008 sales of 248 billion underlying sales growth is expected to be in the range of negative 4 percent to positive 4 percent which excludes an estimated 5 percent unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation at current exchange rates and a favorable impact from completed and assumed future acquisitions of approximately 4 percent based on this level of sales the company forecasts 2009 earnings per share in the range of 280 to 320 there can be no assurance when and if future acquisitions will be completed and what impact future exchange rates will have 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap management uses additional measures including nongaap financial measures as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the securities and exchange commission to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example these financial measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions divestitures onetime gains and losses or items outside of management’s control eg foreign currency exchange rates management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and performance 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability underlying sales should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to net sales as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with us gaap 

earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding onetime gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items given the unique nature of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors however these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings earnings per share return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures although   management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

overall while emerson believes these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore they may not be comparable among companies

the information set forth under “item 1a risk factors” is hereby incorporated by reference 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleum based chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from non  us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our operating results while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

downturns in the end markets that we serve may negatively impact our segment revenues and profitability 

our segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim or may in the future claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

fiscal 2008 outlook 

the outlook for emerson remains positive moving into fiscal 2008 many of emerson’s end markets remain strong but a moderation in growth rates is expected when compared to 2007 underlying sales growth for fiscal 2008 is expected to be in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent which excludes the expected 2 percent to 3 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation acquisitions and divestitures reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 7 percent to 10 percent based on this level of sales growth the company expects to generate 2008 earnings per share growth in the range of 10 percent to 15 percent above the 266 per share earned in fiscal 2007 

nongaap financial measures 

 

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap management uses additional measures including nongaap financial measures as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the securities and exchange commission to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example these financial measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions divestitures onetime gains and losses or items outside of management’s control eg foreign currency exchange rates management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and performance 

 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability underlying sales should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to net sales as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with us gaap 

earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding onetime gains and losses for example 2005 tax expense for earnings repatriation or 2003 gains from divestitures provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items given the unique nature of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors however these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings earnings per share return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures although   management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with us gaap 

 

overall while emerson believes these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore they may not be comparable among companies

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

  

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleum based chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

  

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from non  us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our operating results while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

downturns in the end markets that we serve may negatively impact our segment revenues and profitability 

our segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend information appearing under “results of operations” “financial position capital resources and liquidity” “critical accounting policies” and the “safe harbor statement” in the 2006 annual report are hereby incorporated by reference 

fiscal 2007 outlook 

the outlook for emerson remains positive moving into fiscal 2007 many of emerson’s end markets remain strong but a moderation in growth rates is expected when compared to 2006 underlying sales growth for fiscal 2007 is expected to be in the range of 5 to 7 percent excluding the expected 2 to 4 percent favorable impact from foreign currency translation acquisitions and divestitures reported sales growth is expected to be in the range of 7 to 11 percent based on this level of sales growth the company expects to generate 2007 earnings per share growth in the range of 12 to 15 percent above the 448 per share earned in 2006 

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap management uses additional measures including nongaap financial measures as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the securities and exchange commission to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example these financial measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions divestitures onetime gains and losses or items outside of management’s control eg foreign currency exchange rates management believes that the following nongaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson’s financial position and performance 

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability underlying sales should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to net sales as determined in accordance with us gaap 

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability 

  

management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative to pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with us gaap 

earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding onetime gains and losses for example 2005 tax expense for earnings repatriation or 2003 gains from divestitures provide additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items given the unique nature of these items management believes that presenting earnings earnings per share return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors however these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings earnings per share return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with us gaap 

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures although management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with us gaap 

overall while emerson believes these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap further the calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore they may not be comparable among companies

risk factors 

  

investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

  

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

  

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

  

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

  

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

  

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

  

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleum based chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

  

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences 

  

our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

  

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

  

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from non  us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our operating results while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

  

downturns in the end markets that we serve may negatively impact our segment revenues and profitability 

  

our segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results 

  

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

  

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

information appearing under “overview” “results of operations” “financial position capital resources and liquidity” and “critical accounting policies” and the “safe harbor statement” in the 2005 annual report are hereby incorporated by reference 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement emerson’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap management uses additional measures including nongaap financial measures as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the securities exchange commission to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future these measures may exclude for example the impact of unique items acquisitions divestitures onetime gains and losses or items outside of management’s control foreign currency exchange rates 

  

underlying sales which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are provided to facilitate relevant periodtoperiod comparisons of sales growth excluding these unique items 

  

operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of shortterm operational performance and ongoing profitability management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability 

  

earnings per share excluding gains from divestitures provides additional insight into the underlying ongoing operating performance of the company which facilitates periodtoperiod comparisons excluding the earnings impact of onetime gains from strategic portfolio decisions 

  

earnings and earnings per share excluding the 2005 tax expense for earnings repatriation provides additional insight into the underlying operating performance of the company which facilitates comparison excluding the earnings impact of the onetime opportunity to repatriate earnings at a favorable tax rate 

  

free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company’s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures 

  

while emerson believes these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap further these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies

risk factors investing in our securities involves risks we may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 

we operate in businesses that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for our products 

our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and we compete on the basis of product performance quality service andor price across the industries and markets served a significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high quality products at the lowest relevant global cost some of our competitors have greater sales assets and financial resources than our company competitive pressures could affect prices or customer demand for our products impacting our profit margins andor resulting in a loss of market share 

our operating results depend in part on continued successful research development and marketing of new andor improved products and services and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services 

the success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand which result in unpredictable product transitions shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services we may experience difficulties or delays in the research development production andor marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market 

we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses and therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we are a company that from time to time seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions in the past several years we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and may continue to do so in the future the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

access to funding through the capital markets is essential to the execution of our business plan and if we are unable to maintain such access we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our ability to invest in our businesses make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support shortterm borrowings if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we use a variety of raw materials and components in our businesses and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our major requirements for raw materials include steel copper cast iron electronics aluminum and brass and to a lesser extent plastics and other petroleum based chemicals emerson has multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements and is not significantly dependent on any one or a few suppliers significant shortages or price increases could affect the prices our affected businesses charge their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operations depend on production facilities throughout the world a majority of which are located outside the united states and subject to increased risks of disrupted production causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue 

we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide a majority of which are located outside the united states serving a global customer base requires that we place more production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our bestcost position our international production facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster labor strike war political unrest terrorist activity or public health concerns particularly in emerging countries that are not wellequipped to handle such occurrences our manufacturing facilities abroad also may be more susceptible to changes in laws and policies in host countries and economic and political upheaval than our domestic facilities any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us 

our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies 

we sell manufacture engineer and purchase products in overseas markets a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states and we expect sales from non  us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales international sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments taxation exchange controls and repatriation of earnings changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect our operating results while we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce this exposure through hedging activities this risk could adversely affect our operating results 

downturns in the end markets that we serve may negatively impact our segment revenues and profitability 

our segment revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that we serve future downturns in any of the markets that we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and operating results for example we experienced a significant decline in our network power segment operating results in 2001 and 2002 as a result of extremely difficult market conditions 

we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results 

we are and may in the future be a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims including those involving product liability and environmental matters several of which claim significant damages given the inherent uncertainty of litigation we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact we also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws
