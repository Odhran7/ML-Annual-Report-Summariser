competition 

our bromine business serves markets in the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace our most significant competitors are lanxess ag and israel chemicals ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the bromine we use is originally sourced from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our bromine production operations in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in safi jordan we acquire bromine that is originally sourced from the dead sea jbc processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products see item 2 properties regarding additional disclosures for our mineral properties 

catalysts segment 

our three main product lines in this segment are i clean fuels technologies “cft” which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” together with isomerization and akylation catalysts ii fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” catalysts and additives and iii performance catalyst solutions “pcs” which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives 

we offer a wide range of hpc products which are applied throughout the oil refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes we continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market 



we provide our customers with customized fcc catalyst systems which assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs 

within our pcs product line we manufacture organometallic cocatalysts eg aluminum magnesium and zinc alkyls used in the manufacture of alphaolefins eg hexene octene decene polyolefins eg polyethylene and polypropylene and electronics our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes epoxies and other engineered resins 

there were more than 600 refineries worldwide in 2021 we expect to continue to see some less profitable typically smaller refineries shutting down and over the longterm being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries with growth concentrated in the middle east and asia oil refinery utilization was lower in 2021 and 2020 compared to the prior years with most refineries cutting throughput due to the reduction in demand resulting from global travel restrictions to contain the covid19 pandemic we estimate that there are currently approximately 600 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3000 hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to four years 

competition 

our catalysts segment serves the global market including the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive competition in these markets is driven by a variety factors product performance and quality price and contract terms product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace in addition through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

our major competitors in the cft catalysts market include shell catalysts  technologies advanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co basf corporation and china petrochemical corporation sinopec in the pcs market our major competitors include nouryon lanxess ag and arxada

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin aluminum ethylene alphaolefins isobutylene toluene and metals such as lanthanum molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility 

human capital 

our main human capital management objectives are to attract retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe supported and empowered to do the best work they can do we believe providing a diverse equal and inclusive workplace facilitates opportunities for innovation fosters good decision making practices and promotes employee engagement and high productivity across our organization 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 6000 employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures of whom 2600 or 43 are employed in the us and the americas 1600 or 27 are employed in asia pacific 1400 or 23 are employed in europe and 400 or 7 are employed in the middle east or other areas approximately 46 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils we believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees and with those unions and works councils 

health and safety 

the health and safety of our employees is a part of our core values at albemarle and is integral to how we conduct business our employees contractors and visitors follow a comprehensive set of written health and safety policies and procedures at both the corporate and local site levels we routinely audit ourselves against our policies procedures and standards using internal and thirdparty resources we also include health and safety metrics in our annual incentive plan for all employees to incentivize our commitment to safety in 2021 we improved our occupational safety and health act “osha” occupational injury and illness incident rate to 019 for our employees and nested contractors compared to 026 in 2020 in 



addition we provide all employees and their dependents with access to our employee assistance program which provides free mental and behavioral health resources 

in response to the covid19 pandemic albemarle’s crossfunctional global response team continues to meet regularly to address employee health and safety and operational challenges our first priority is always the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and communities since the start of the pandemic our focus has shifted from managing an immediate crisis to building in the flexibility needed to adjust for regional differences and changing conditions protocols that include restricted travel shift adjustments increased hygiene and social distancing for the essential workers at our plants have been put in place at all locations in some regions employees are able to return to their work sites other regions including most of north and south america remain on workfromhome protocols for nonessential personnel 

diversity equity and inclusion 

in 2020 we hired a vice president diversity and inclusion to accelerate our inclusion and diversity initiatives and deliver meaningful change in our global organization our primary focus in our recruiting efforts is to drive greater diversity in our workforce including higher representation in the professional and managerial job categories we want to ensure that our workplace reflects the communities in which we live and work our recruiting policy includes a requirement that we include individuals from gender or racial minority groups among those we interview for openings at the manager level and above 

we seek to provide employees with a desirable workplace that will enable us to attract and retain top talent we believe employees should be compensated through wages and benefits based on experience expertise performance and the criticality of their roles in the company we also perform an annual review of our pay practices to ensure that they are fair and equitable and not influenced by biased opinions or discrimination in addition we have established employee groups known as connect groups to promote an atmosphere of inclusion and encouragement in which every employee’s voice can be heard these connect groups provide opportunities for employees to share their backgrounds experiences and beliefs and to use them to benefit others through mentoring and volunteering in the local community among other activities 

investment in talent 

investing in talent is a critical process for albemarle because it allows us to be proactive and anticipate key organizational needs for talent and capabilities this enables us to efficiently and effectively ensure that we have the right talent pipeline to drive albemarle’s success into the future we also provide leadership development through performance coaching 360degree feedback plant training including health safety and environmental and experiential development and mentoring our leadership development is a cornerstone to our talent management strategy 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales and technical personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers globally we also utilize commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas when necessary or required by law 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2021 we owned more than 2000 active patents and more than 450 pending patent applications in key 



strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the osha we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program as noted above we finished 2021 with an osha occupational injury and illness incident rate of 019 for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 026 in 2020 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

the toxic substances control act “tsca” as amended in june 2016 requires chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation this regulation and other pending initiatives at the us state level as well as initiatives in canada asia and other regions will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have 



liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further details 

climate change and natural resources 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities we provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation 

in addition to potential business opportunities we acknowledge our responsibility to address the impact of our operations on the environment we are investing in technology and people to reduce energy consumption greenhouse gas emissions and air emissions of ozonedepleting substances in 2021 we established greenhouse gas emission targets for each of our businesses including achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 reducing the carbonintensity of our bromine and catalysts businesses by a combined 35 by 2030 and growing our lithium business in a carbonintensity neutral manner through 2030 

water is a critical input to albemarle’s production operations as water is a scarce resource we understand the need to responsibly manage our water consumption not only for the preservation of the environment but for the viability of our local communities we are investing in new process technologies to reduce our water footprint and expand capacity sustainably in locations with high water risk our goal is to reduce our intensity of freshwater usage by 25 by 2030 in areas of high or extremely highwater risk such as chile and jordan as defined by the world resources institute 

our businesses are dependent on the availability and responsible management of natural resources we manage our natural resources to operate efficiently and preserve the environment for our local communities and the world our natural resource management includes mineral resource transparency with local communities governments regulators and other key stakeholders as well as partnering with the initiative for responsible mining assurance for our lithium production for the assurance of responsible mining we attempt to maximize the recovery of our extracted minerals and recycle or reuse byproducts where possible in addition we work with local communities regulatory agencies and wildlife organizations to preserve and restore land and biodiversity before during and after all operations commence 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

during recent years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries in addition we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses which do not fit our high priority business growth profile following is a summary of our significant acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures over the last three years 

on september 30 2021 the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of guangxi tianyuan new energy materials co ltd “tianyuan” for approximately 200 million in cash tianyuans operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the port of qinzhou in guangxi china the plant has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent “lce” and is capable of producing batterygrade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide the plant is currently in the commissioning stage and is expected to begin commercial production in the first half of 2022 the company expects the transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions to close in the first half of 2022

 item 1a risk factors tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us with approximately 78 of our sales to foreign countries we operate andor sell our products to customers in approximately 70 countries we currently have many production facilities research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the us as detailed in item 2 properties accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency 

• transportation and other shipping costs may increase or transportation may be inhibited 

• increased cost or decreased availability of raw materials 

• increased regulations on or reduced access to scare resources such as freshwater 

• changes in foreign laws and tax rates or us laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed impose new and additional taxes on remittances repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits 



• foreign countries in which we do business may adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment including currency exchange controls 

• trade sanctions by or against these countries could result in our losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries 

• unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur 

• our agreements with counterparties in foreign countries may be difficult for us to enforce and related receivables may be difficult for us to collect 

• compliance with the variety of foreign laws and regulations may be unduly burdensome 

• compliance with antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act as well as antimoneylaundering laws may be costly 

• unexpected adverse changes in export duties quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses may occur 

• general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries 

• our foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes 

• termination or substantial modification of international trade agreements may adversely affect our access to raw materials and to markets for our products outside the us 

• foreign governments may nationalize or expropriate private enterprises 

• increased sovereign risk such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments may occur and 

• political or economic repercussions from terrorist activities including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability may occur in certain countries in which we do business 

in addition certain of our operations and we have ongoing capital projects in regions of the world such as the middle east and south america that are of high risk due to significant civil political and security instability unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

furthermore we are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery and antitrust prohibitions of the us and other countries as well as export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all including due to climate change could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will in part depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities which could adversely impact us furthermore other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to do so or may be delayed in doing so in addition raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 



competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

we compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins and profitability our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

in addition albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims whether with or without merit against our company or its products imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us or are otherwise disparaging of our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing end markets as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all as may be required to replace or enhance existing products and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position 

in addition our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

despite our efforts we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace furthermore ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

the development of nonlithium battery technologies could adversely affect us 

the development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues current and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input alternative materials and technologies are being researched with the goal of making batteries lighter more efficient faster charging and less expensive and some of these could be less reliant on lithium compounds we cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and on what time horizon commercialized battery technologies that use no or significantly less lithium could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues 



downturns in our customers’ industries many of which are cyclical could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries which are cyclical in nature or which are subject to secular market downturns historically cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to four years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union “eu” continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under reach which imposes obligations on eu manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the eu to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain see “regulation” in item 1 business our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the eu requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

the tsca requires chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation this regulation and other pending initiatives at the us state level as well as initiatives in canada asia and other regions could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 



we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation as well as natural resource extraction including explosions fires severe weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of disruptions shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous us and nonus national federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties we currently use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities including for example current and prior property owners or operators as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify 

further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 



compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing registrationapproval requirements transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years we expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar foreign anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management if we are found to be liable for violations of the fcpa or other applicable anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our joint ventures we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as first reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by thirdparty sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of thirdparty sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the us department of justice “doj” the sec and the dutch public prosecutor “dpp” and are cooperating with the doj the sec and the dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures we have commenced discussions with the sec about a potential resolution 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations we also are unable to predict what action may be taken by the doj the sec or the dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may ultimately seek any determination that our operations or activities are not or were not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses an adverse resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period 



we are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business 

we are subject to government regulation in nonus jurisdictions in which we conduct our business the requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses or require changes in business practice in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights or being accused of infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties  could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries or their enforcement may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise in addition our trade secrets and knowhow may be improperly obtained by other means such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft 

our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability 

our lithium reserves will without more decline as we continue to extract these raw materials accordingly our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably once a site with potential resources is discovered it may take several years of development until production is possible during which time the economic viability of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 



we utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project the actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as but not limited to changes in volumes grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made adverse geotechnical conditions availability supply and cost of water and power fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development changes in royalty agreements laws andor regulations around royalties and other taxes and weather or severe climate impacts 

for our existing operations we utilize geological and metallurgical assumptions financial projections and price estimates these estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material revisions to environmental obligations changes in legislation andor social political or economic environment and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable reserves including many factors beyond our control that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges in addition it cannot be assumed that any part or all of the inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves as defined by the sec see item 2 properties for a discussion and quantification of our current mineral resources and reserves 

there is risk to the growth of lithium markets 

our lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium batteries and the growth in demand for plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles to the extent that such development adoption and growth do not occur in the volume andor manner that we contemplate including for reasons described under the heading “the development of nonlithium battery technologies could adversely affect us” above the longterm growth in the markets for lithium products may be adversely affected which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

demand and market prices for lithium will greatly affect the value of our investment in our lithium resources and our ability to develop it successfully 

our ability to successfully develop our lithium resources including our 60 interest in marbl’s wodgina mine and generate a return on investment will be affected by changes in the demand for and market price of lithiumbased end products such as lithium hydroxide the market price of these products can fluctuate and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control primarily world supply and demand such external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns various political developments and macroeconomic circumstances in addition the price of lithium products is impacted by their purity and performance we may not be able to effectively mitigate against such fluctuations 

following the wodgina acquisition the wodgina mine idled production of spodumene until market demand supported bringing the mine back into production in october 2021 marbl announced its intention to resume spodumene concentrate production at the wodgina mine with the production restart expected during the second quarter of 2022 but there are no assurances that the mine will be put back into production in that time frame or at all delays in putting the mine into production as well as continued fluctuations in demand for and pricing of lithium and related products may affect the value of our investment in wodgina and our value as a whole 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team in light of the specialized and technical nature of our business our performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 



some of our employees are unionized represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 6000 employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures approximately 46 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our financial condition 

our required capital expenditures can be complex may experience delays or other difficulties and the costs may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment facilities and properties and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment facilities and properties execution of these capital expenditures can be complex and commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products in addition our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including crossdefaults to 



other debt facilities see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the eu euro japanese yen chinese renminbi australian dollar and chilean peso exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 27 of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 



we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to periods prior to our 2015 acquisition of rockwood holdings inc “rockwood” these indemnity obligations will continue generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity our earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the applicable tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings which may be material in the future the outcome of proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables 

legal and regulatory proceedings whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other resources inhibit our ability to sell our products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and otherwise negatively affect our business 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us uk germany belgium and japan we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 10 million of required cash contributions during 2022 for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2022 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 



further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs and support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

• potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• unforeseen claims and liabilities including unexpected environmental exposures 

• unforeseen adjustments charges and writeoffs 

• problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities 

• unexpected losses of customers of or suppliers to the acquired business 

• difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses’ standards processes procedures and controls with our operations 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting 

• inability to coordinate new product and process development 

• loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and 

• challenges arising from the increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants in addition the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences and risks for us including 

• reducing flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses the competitive environment and the industries in which we operate and to technological and other changes 

• lowering credit ratings 



• reducing access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future operating and capital expenses and for general corporate purposes 

• reducing funds available for operations capital expenditures share repurchases dividends and other activities and 

• creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition 

general risk factors 

adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a global regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national regional and global economies including economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches information technology system failures or network disruptions 

attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

in addition risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and around the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 



we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program “cfats program” which is administered by the department of homeland security “dhs” identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 “cfats act” was enacted dhs has enacted new rules under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of the uss chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we have implemented all necessary changes to comply with the rules under the cfats program to date however we cannot determine with certainty any future costs associated with any additional security measures that dhs may require 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and the markets for our products in particular the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption while we have not experienced a material impact to date the ultimate extent to which it impacts our business results of operations financial position and cash flows is difficult to predict and dependent upon many factors over which we have no control these factors include but are not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic including from the discovery of new strain variants government restrictions on businesses and individuals the health and safety of our employees and communities in which we do business the impact of the pandemic on our customers businesses and the resulting demand for our products the impact on our suppliers and supply chain network the impact on us and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery and potential adverse effects on the financial markets 

the company has taken and plans to continue to take certain measures to maintain financial flexibility including reducing debt balances with an underwritten public offering of its common stock and implementing a cost savings initiative while still protecting our employees and customers however if conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic worsen the company may not be able to maintain compliance with its financial covenants and could be required to seek additional amendments to the credit agreements if the company were not able to obtain any such necessary additional amendments that would lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the company to repay its outstanding debt in that situation the company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay the lenders 

natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our results of operations 

the occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes floods or earthquakes pandemics such as covid19 or other unanticipated catastrophes at any of the locations in which we or our key partners suppliers and customers do business could cause interruptions in our operations historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes and our operations in asia could be subject to weather events such as typhoons a global or regional pandemic or similar outbreak in a region of our our customers or our suppliers could disrupt business if similar or other weather events natural disasters or other catastrophe events occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 



our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and other insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and coverage limits we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations in addition we have operations in the eu brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented or may implement measures to achieve objectives under the 2015 paris climate agreement an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities and fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

mineral properties 

set forth below are details regarding our mineral properties operated by us and our affiliates which have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of regulation sk issued by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as used in this annual report on form 10k the terms “mineral resource” “measured mineral resource” “indicated 



mineral resource” “inferred mineral resource” “mineral reserve” “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are defined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of regulation sk under subpart 1300 of regulation sk mineral resources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person “qp” that the mineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project 

except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value inferred mineral resources are estimates based on limited geological evidence and sampling and have a too high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be converted to a mineral reserve it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category a significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category therefore it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists that it can be the basis of an economically viable project that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category or that all or any part of the mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves see risk factor  “our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability” in item 1a risk factors 

overview 

at december 31 2021 we had the following mineral extraction facilities 





a through our marbl joint venture we own 60 interest in the wodgina project we are providing 100 of attributable value for wodgina mineral resources based on intended marketing of 100 of the output of the mining operation to the kemerton lithium hydroxide processing plant 

b following the wodgina acquisition in 2019 the wodgina mine idled production of spodumene until market demand supported bringing the mine back into production in october 2021 our 60owned marbl joint venture announced its intention to resume spodumene concentrate production at the wodgina mine with the production restart expected during the second quarter of 2022 

c site includes onsite or otherwise nearby exclusive conversion facilities see individual property disclosure below for further details 

aggregate annual production from our mineral extraction facilities is shown in the below table amounts represent albemarle’s attributable portion based on ownership percentages noted above and are shown in thousands of metric tons “mt” of lithium metal and bromine production lithium and bromine is extracted as brine or hard rock concentrate at the extraction facilities these are then further converted into various compounds and products at onsite processing facilities or other conversion facilities owned by albemarle around the world in addition the brine or concentrate can be used by tolling entities for further processing 



see individual property disclosure below for further details regarding mineral rights titles property size permits and other information for our significant mineral extraction properties the extracted brine or hard rock is processed at facilities on location as described below or processed or further processed at other facilities throughout the world 

the following table provides a summary of our mineral resources exclusive of reserves at december 31 2021 the below mineral resource amounts are rounded and shown in thousands of mt the amounts represent albemarle’s attributable portion based on ownership percentages noted above the relevant technical information supporting mineral resources for each material property is included in the ”material individual properties” section below as well as the in the technical report summaries filed as exhibits 961 to 966 to this report 



a through our marbl joint venture we own 60 interest in the wodgina project we are providing 100 of attributable value for wodgina mineral resources based on intended marketing of 100 of the output of the mining operation to the kemerton lithium hydroxide processing plant 

the feedstock for the safi jordan site owned 50 by albemarle through its jbc joint venture is drawn from the dead sea a nonconventional reservoir owned by the nations of israel and jordan as such there are no specific resources owned by jbc but albemarle’s joint venture partner arab potash company “apc” has exclusive rights granted by the hashemite kingdom of jordan to withdraw brine from the dead sea and process it to extract minerals the resource base of bromide ion 



estimated to be allocated to jordan’s share of the dead sea is estimated at 3549 million mt jbc is extracting approximately 1 percent of the bromine available bromide concentration in the dead sea is estimated to average approximately 5000 mgl 

there are no mineral resource estimates at the magnolia ar bromine extraction site all bromine mineral accumulations of economic interest and with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction within the magnolia production lease area are either currently on production or subject to an economically viable future development plan and are classified as mineral reserves 

the following table provides a summary of our mineral reserves at december 31 2021 the below mineral reserve amounts are rounded and shown in thousands of mt the amounts represent albemarle’s attributable portion based on ownership percentages noted above the relevant technical information supporting mineral reserves for each material property is included in the ”material individual properties” section below as well as the in the technical report summaries filed as exhibits 961 to 966 to this report 



a the wodgina mine is at an initial assessment level and as a result contains no mineral reserves mineral reserve estimates are not applicable for the kings mountain site 

b the concentration of bromine at the magnolia site varies based on the physical location of the field and can range up to over 6000 mgl 

the mineral reserve estimate for the safi jordan bromine site is 489 million mt of bromine from the dead sea this estimate is based on the time available under the concession agreement with the hashemite kingdom of jordan and the processing capability of the jbc plant as only approximately one percent of the available resource is consumed as noted above the reserve estimate is based on the amount the jbc plant can produce over until the end of 2058 when the apc concession agreement ends bromine concentration used to calculate the reserve estimate from the dead sea was approximately 8890 mgl based on historical pumping 

mineral resource and reserve estimates were prepared by a qp with an effective date provided in the individual technical report summaries filed as exhibits 961 to 966 to this report differences from those amounts in the technical report summaries represent depletion from the effective date of the report until december 31 2021 our mineral resource and reserve estimates are based on many factors including the area and volume covered by our mining rights assumptions regarding our extraction rates based upon an expectation of operating the mines on a longterm basis and the quality of inplace reserves 

internal controls 

the modeling and analysis of our mineral resources and reserves was developed by our site personnel and reviewed by several levels of internal management as well as the qp for each site the development of such resources and reserves estimates including related assumptions were prepared by a qp 

when determining resources and reserves as well as the differences between resources and reserves management developed specific criteria each of which must be met to qualify as a resource or reserve respectively these criteria such as demonstration of economic viability points of reference and grade are specific and attainable the qp and management agree 



on the reasonableness of the criteria for the purposes of estimating resources and reserves calculations using these criteria are reviewed and validated by the qp 

estimations and assumptions were developed independently for each significant mineral location all estimates require a combination of historical data and key assumptions and parameters when possible resources and data from public information and generally accepted industry sources such as governmental resource agencies were used to develop these estimations 

each site has developed quality control and quality assurance “qcqa” procedures which were reviewed by the qp to ensure the process for developing mineral resource and reserve estimates were sufficiently accurate qcqa procedures include independent checks duplicates on samples by third party laboratories blind blankstandard insertion into sample streams duplicate sampling among others in addition the qps reviewed the consistency of historical production at each site as part of their analysis of the qcqa procedures see details of the controls for each site in the technical summary reports filed as exhibits 961 to 966 to this report 

we recognize the risks inherent in mineral resource and reserve estimates such as the geological complexity the interpretation and extrapolation of field and well data changes in operating approach macroeconomic conditions and new data among others the capital operating and economic analysis estimates rely on a range of assumptions and forecasts that are subject to change in addition certain estimates are based on mineral rights agreements with local and foreign governments any changes to these access rights could impact the estimates of mineral resources and reserves calculated in these reports overestimated resources and reserves resulting from these risks could have a material effect on future profitability

greenbushes australia 



the greenbushes mine is a hard rock open pit mine latitude 33° 52´s longitude 116° 04´ e located approximately 250km south of perth western australia 90km southeast of the port of bunbury a major bulkhandling port in the southwest of western australia the lithium mining operation is near the greenbushes townsite located in the shire of bridgetowngreenbushes access to the greenbushes mine is via the paved south western highway between bunbury and bridgetown to greenbushes township and via the paved maranup ford road to the greenbushes mine 

lithium production from the greenbushes mine has been undertaken continuously for more than 20 years modern exploration has been undertaken on the property since the mid1980s first by greenbushes limited then by lithium australia ltd and in turn by sons of gwalia prior to the acquisition of greenbushes by talison in 2007 initial exploration focused largely on tantalum with the emphasis changing to lithium from around 2000 in 2014 rockwood acquired a 49 ownership interest in windfield which owns 100 of talison from sichuan tianqi lithium industries inc this 49 ownership in windfield was assumed by albemarle in 2015 as part of the acquisition of rockwood we purchase lithium concentrate from windfield and our investment in the joint venture is reported as an unconsolidated equity investment on our balance sheet 

about 55 of the tenements held by talison are covered by western australia’s state forest which is under the authority of the western australia department of biodiversity conservation and attractions the majority of the remaining land is private land that covers about 40 of the surface rights the remaining ground comprises crown land road reserves and other miscellaneous reserves the tenements cover a total area of approximately 10000 hectares and include the historic greenbushes tin tantalum and current lithium mining areas see section 3 of the greenbushes technical report summary filed as exhibit 961 to this report for a listing of tenements held by the greenbushes site talison holds the mining rights for all lithium minerals on these tenements the operating open pit lithium mining and processing plant area covers approximately 2000 hectares comprising three mining leases all lithium mining activities including tailings storage processing plant operations open pits and waste rock dumps are currently carried out within the boundaries of the three mining leases plus two general purpose leases in order to keep the granted tenements in good standing talison is required to maintain permits make an annual contribution to the statutory mining rehabilitation fund and pay a royalty on concentrate sales for lithium mineral production as prescribed under the mining act 1978 in western australia there are no private royalties that apply to the greenbushes property talison reviews and renews all tenements on an annual basis 

the greenbushes deposit consists of a main raremetal zoned pegmatite body with numerous smaller footwall pegmatite dykes and pods the primary intrusion and its subsidiary dykes and pods are concentrated within shear zones on the boundaries of granofels ultramafic schists and amphibolites the pegmatites are crosscut by ferrousrich mafic dolerite which is of paramount importance to the currant mining methods the pegmatite body is over 3 km long north by northwest up to 300 meters wide normal to dip strikes north to northwest and dips moderately to steeply west to southwest 

the major minerals from the greenbushes pegmatite are quartz spodumene albite and kfeldspar the main lithiumbearing minerals are spodumene containing approximately 8 lithium oxide and varieties kunzite and hiddenite minor to trace lithium minerals include lepidolite mica amblygonite and lithiophilite lithium is readily leached in the weathering environment and thus is virtually nonexistent in weathered pegmatite exploration drilling at greenbushes has been ongoing for over 40 years including drilling in 2020 using reverse circulation and diamond drill holes 

three lithium mineral processing plants are currently operating on the greenbushes site two chemical grade plants and a technical grade plant tailings are discharged to the tailings storage facility without the need for any neutralization process additional infrastructure on site includes power and water supply facilities a laboratory administrative offices occupational healthsafetytraining offices dedicated mines rescue area stores storage sheds workshops and engineering offices the greenbushes site also leases production drills excavators trucks and various support equipment to extract the ore deposit by open pit methods talison’s power is delivered by a local distribution system and reticulated and metered within the site water is sourced from rainfall and stored in several process dams located on site we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2021 our 49 ownership interest of the gross asset value of the facilities at the greenbushes site was approximately 4156 million 

talison ships the chemicalgrade lithium concentrate in vessels to our facilities in meishan and xinyu china to process into batterygrade lithium hydroxide in addition the output from talison can be used by tolling entities in china to produce both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide 

a summary of the greenbushes facility’s lithium mineral resources and reserves as of december 31 2021 are shown in the following tables this is the first period estimated mineral resources exclusive of reserves and reserves have been developed for greenbushes since being acquired by albemarle srk consulting us inc “srk” a thirdparty firm comprising mining experts in accordance with item 1302b1 of regulation sk served as the qp and prepared the estimates

wodgina australia 

the wodgina property which includes a hard rock open pit mine latitude 21° 11 25s longitude 118° 40 25e  is located approximately 110 km southsoutheast of port hedland western australia between the turner and yule rivers the area includes multiple prominent greenstone ridges up to 180 m above mean sea level surrounded by granitic plains and lowlands the property is accessible via national highway 1 to national highway 95 to the wodgina camp road all roads to site are paved the nearest large regional airport is in port hedland which also hosts an international deepwater port facility in addition a site dedicated allweather airstrip is located near to site capable of landing certain aircrafts 

the wodgina pegmatite deposits were discovered in 1902 since then the pegmatitehosted deposits have been mined for tin tantalum beryl and lithium by various companies mining occurred sporadically until goldrim mining formed a new partnership with pan west tantalum pty ltd who opened open pit mining at the site in 1989 and progressively expanded during the 1990s active mining at the mt cassiterite pit has been started and stopped regularly between 2008 and the present the mine was placed on care and maintenance in 2008 2012 and most recently in 2019 in 2016 mrl acquired the mine and upgraded the processing facilities and site infrastructure to 750ktpa spodumene plant producing 6 spodumene concentrate completed in 2019 on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in this hard rock lithium mine project and formed an unincorporated joint venture with mrl named marbl we formed marbl for the exploration development mining processing and production of lithium and other minerals other than iron ore and tantalum from the wodgina project following the acquisition marbl’s production of spodumene was idled until market demand supported bringing the mine back into production in october 2021 our 60owned marbl joint venture announced its intention to resume spodumene concentrate production at the wodgina mine with the production restart expected during the second quarter of 2022 

wodgina holds mining tenements within the karriyarra native title claim and are subject to the land use agreement dated march 2001 between the karriyarra people and gwalia tantalum ltd now wodgina lithium a 100 subsidiary of mrl our marbl joint venture partner see section 3 of the wodgina technical report summary filed as exhibit 962 to this report for a listing of all mining and exploration land tenements which are in good standing and no known impediments exist certain 



tenements are due for renewal in 2026 and another in 2030 drilling and exploration activities have been conducted throughout the mining life of the wodgina property

salar de atacamala negra chile 

the salar de atacama is located in the commune of san pedro de atacama with the operations approximately 100 kilometers to the south of this commune in the extreme east of the antofagasta region and close to the border with the republics of argentina and bolivia access to the property is on the major fourlane paved panamericana route 5 north from antofagasta chile approximately 60 km northeast to b385 on b385 a twolane paved highway the albemarle salar de atacama project latitude 23°383152s longitude 68°193031w is approximately 175 km to the east the site has a small private airport that serves the project a small paved runway airport is also located near san pedro de atacama and a large international airport is located in antofagasta the la negra plant latitude 23°452031s longitude 70°183692w has direct access roads and located approximately 20 km by paved four lane highway route 28 southeast of antofagasta turning north approximately 3 km on route 5 

in the early 1960s water with high concentrations of salts was discovered in the salar de atacama basin in january 1975 one of our predecessors foote mineral company signed a longterm contract with the chilean government for mineral rights with respect to the salar de atacama consisting exclusively of the right to access lithium brine covering an area of approximately 16700 hectares see section 3 of the salar de atacama technical report summary filed as exhibit 963 to this report for a listing of mining concessions at the salar de atacama site the contract originally permitted the production and sale of up to 200000 metric tons of lithium metal equivalent “lme” a calculated percentage of lce in 1981 the first construction of evaporation ponds in the salar de atacama began the following year the construction of the lithium carbonate plant in la negra began in 1990 the facilities at the salar de atacama were expanded with a new well system and the capacity of the lithium carbonate plant in the la negra plant was expanded in 1998 the lithium chloride plant in la negra began operating the same year that chemetall purchased foote mineral company subsequently in 2004 chemetall was acquired by rockwood and in 2015 rockwood was acquired by albemarle effective january 1 2017 the chilean government and albemarle entered into an annex to the original agreement through which its duration was modified extending it until the balance of a the original 200000 metric tons of lme and an additional 262132 metric tons of lme granted through this annex have been exploited processed and sold or b on january 1 2044 whichever comes first in addition the amended 



agreement provides for commission payments to the chilean government based on sales pricemetric ton on the amounts sold under the additional quota granted our support of research and development in chile of lithium applications and solar energy and our support of local communities in northern chile albemarle currently operates its extraction and production facilities in chile under this mineral rights agreement with the chilean government 

the salar de atacama is a salt flat the largest in chile located in the atacama desert in northern chile which is the driest place on the planet and thus has an extremely high annual rate of evaporation and extremely low annual rainfall our extraction through evaporation process works as follows snow in the andes mountains melts and flows into underground pools of water containing brine which generally have high concentrations of lithium we then pump the water containing brine above ground through a series of pumps and wells into a network of large evaporation ponds over the course of approximately eighteen months the desert sun evaporates the water causing other salts to precipitate and leaving behind concentrated lithium brine if weather conditions are not favorable the evaporation process may be prolonged after we obtain the lithium brine from the salar de atacama we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at our manufacturing facilities in nearby la negra chile 

the filling materials of the salar de atacama basin are dominated by the vilama formation and the more recently in geologic time by evaporitic and clastic materials that are currently being deposited in the basin these units house the basins aquifer system and are composed of evaporitic chemical sediments that include carbonate gypsum and halite intervals interrupted by volcanic deposits of large sheets of ignimbrite volcanic ash and smaller classical deposits lithiumrich brines are extracted from the halite aquifer that is located within the nucleus of the salt flat the salar de atacama basin contains a continental system of lithiumrich brine these types of systems have six common global characteristics arid climate closed basin that contains a salt flat salt crust a salt lake or both igneous andor hydrothermal activity tectonic subsidence suitable sources of lithium and sufficient time to concentrate the lithium in the brine 

in the salar de atacama basin lithiumrich brines are found in a halite aquifer carbonate and sulfates are found near the edges of the basin the average minimum and maximum concentrations of lithium in the salar de atacama basin are approximately 1400 900 and 7000 mgl respectively from 2017 through 2019 two drilling campaigns were carried out in order to obtain geological and hydrogeological information at the albemarle mining concession 

the facilities at the salar de atacama consist of extraction wells evaporation and concentration ponds leaching plants a potash plant a drying plant services and general areas including salt stockpiles as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment in addition the site includes administrative offices an operations building and a laboratory the extracted concentrated lithium brine is sent to the la negra plant by truck for processing the salar de atacama has its own powerhouse that generates the energy necessary for the entire operation of the facilities we also have permanent and continuous groundwater exploitation rights for two wells that are for industrial use and to supply the salar de atacama facilities the la negra facilities consist of a boron removal plant a calcium and magnesium removal plant two lithium carbonate conversion plants a lithium chloride plant evaporationsedimentation ponds an offsite area where the raw materials are housed and the inputs that are used in the process are prepared a dry area where the various products are prepared as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment la negra is supplied electricity from a local company and has rights to a well in the peine community for its water supply we are currently constructing a third lithium carbonate conversion plant expected to be completed mid2021 followed by a sixmonth commissioning and qualification process we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2021 the combined gross asset value of our facilities at the salar de atacama and in la negra chile not inclusive of construction in process was approximately 9419 million

silver peak nevada 

the silver peak site latitude 37751773°n longitude 117639027°w is located in a rural area approximately 30 miles southwest of tonopah in esmeralda county nevada it is located in the clayton valley an arid valley historically covered with dry lake beds playas the operation borders the small unincorporated town of silver peak nevada albemarle uses the silver peak site for the production of lithium brines which are used to make lithium carbonate and to a lesser degree lithium hydroxide access to the site is off of the paved highway sr265 in the town of silver peak nevada the administrative offices are located on the south side of the road the process facility is on the north side of the road and the brine operations are located approximately three miles east of silver peak on silver peak road and occupy both the north and south sides of the road in addition access to the site is also possible via graveldirt roads from tonopah nevada and goldfield nevada 



lithium brine extraction in the clayton valley began in the mid1960’s by one of our predecessors the foote mineral company since that time lithium brine operations have been operated on a continuous basis in 1998 chemetall purchased foote mineral company subsequently in 2004 chemetall was acquired by rockwood and in 2015 rockwood was acquired by albemarle our mineral rights in silver peak consist of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to our permitted and certified senior water rights a settlement agreement with the us government originally entered into in june 1991 and our patented and unpatented land claims pursuant to the 1991 agreement our water rights and our land claims we have rights to all lithium that we can remove economically from the clayton valley basin in nevada see section 3 of the silver peak technical report summary filed as exhibit 964 to this report for a listing of patented and unpatented claims at the silver peak site we have been operating at the silver peak site since 1966 our silver peak site covers a surface of over 13500 acres more than 10500 acres of which we own through a subsidiary the remaining acres are owned by the us government from whom we lease the land pursuant to unpatented land claims that are renewed annually actual surface disturbance associated with the operations is 7390 acres primarily associated with the evaporation ponds the manufacturing and administrative activities are confined to an area approximately 20 acres in size 

we extract lithium brine from our silver peak site through substantially the same evaporation process we use at the salar de atacama we process the lithium brine extracted from our silver peak site into lithium carbonate at our plant in silver peak it is hypothesized that the current levels of lithium dissolved in brine originate from relatively recent dissolution of halite by meteoric waters that have penetrated the playa in the last 10000 years the halite formed in the playa during the aforementioned climatic periods of low precipitation and that the concentrated lithium was incorporated as liquid inclusions into the halite crystals there are no current exploration activities on the silver peak lithium operation however in january 2021 we announced that we will expand capacity in silver peak and begin a program to evaluate clays and other available nevada resources for commercial production of lithium beginning in 2021 we plan to invest 30 million to 50 million to double the current production in silver peak by 2025 with the aim of making full use of the brine water rights 

the facilities at silver peak consist of extraction wells evaporation and concentration ponds a lithium carbonate plant a lithium anhydrous plant a lithium hydroxide plant a liming plant wellfield and mill maintenance a shipping and packaging facility and administrative offices as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment silver peak is supplied electricity from a local company and we currently have two operating fresh water wells nearby that supply water to the facilities we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2021 the gross asset value of our facilities at our silver peak site was approximately 608 million

safi jordan 

our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in safi jordan acquires bromine that is originally sourced from the dead sea jbc processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products the jbc operation latitude 31°83485n  longitude 35°313468e  is located in safi jordan and is located on a 26ha area on the southeastern edge of the dead sea about 6 kilometers north of the of the apc plant jbc also has a 2hectare storage facility within the freezone industrial area at the port of aqaba the jordan valley highwayroute 65 is the primary method of access for supplies and personnel to jbc the port of aqaba is the main entry point for supplies and equipment for jbc where imported shipping containers are offloaded from ships and are transported by truck to jbc via the jordan valley highway aqaba is approximately 205 km south of jbc via highway 65 major international airports can be readily accessed either at amman or aqaba jordan’s railway transport runs northsouth through jordan and is not used to transport jbc employees and product 

in 1958 the government of the hashemite kingdom of jordan granted apc a concession for exclusive rights to exploit the minerals and salts from the dead sea brine until 2058 at that time apc factories and installations would become the property of the government apc was granted its exclusive mineral rights under the concession ratification law no 16 of 1958 apc produces potash from the brine extracted from the dead sea a concentrated bromideenriched brine extracted from apc’s evaporation ponds is the feed material for the jbc plant following the formation of the joint venture the jbc bromine plant began operations in 2002 expansion of the facilities to double its bromine production capacity went into operation in 2017 

the climate geology and location provide a setting that makes the dead sea a valuable largescale natural resource for potash and bromine today the dead sea has a surface area of 583 km 2 and a brine volume of 110 km 3  the dead sea is the world’s saltiest natural lake containing high concentrations of ions compared to that of regular sea water and an unusually high amount of magnesium and bromine there is an estimated 900 million tonnes of bromine in the dead sea 



mining methods consist of all activities necessary to extract brine from the dead sea and extract bromine the low rainfall low humidity and high temperatures in the dead sea area provide ideal conditions for recovering potash from the brine by solar evaporation jbc obtains its feedbrine from apc’s evaporation pond and this supply is intimately linked to the apc operation as evaporation takes place the specific gravity of the brine increases until its constituent salts progressively crystallize and precipitate out of solution starting with sodium chloride common salt precipitating out to the bottom of the ponds precarnallite ponds brine is transferred to other pans in succession where its specific gravity increases further ultimately precipitating out of the sodium chloride carnallite precipitation takes place at the evaporation pond where it is harvested from the brine and pumped as slurry to a process plant where the potassium chloride is separated from the magnesium chloride jbc extracts the bromiderich “carnallitefree” brine through a pumping station this brine feeds the bromine and magnesium plants there is no exploration as typically conducted for the characterization of a mineral deposit 

infrastructure and facilities to support the operation of the bromine production plant at the safi site is compact and contained in an approximately 33 ha area jbc ships product in bulk through a storage terminal in aqaba there are above ground storage tanks as well as pumps and piping for loading these products onto ships jbc main activities at aqaba are raw materialproduct storing importing and exporting an evaporation pond collects the waste streams from pipe flushing housekeeping and other activities fresh water is sources from the mujib reservoir a manmade reservoir jbc is supplied electricity from the national electric power company of jordan we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2021 our 50 ownership interest of the gross asset value of the facilities at the safi jordan site was approximately 2106 million 

a summary of the safi facility’s bromine mineral resources and reserves as of december 31 2021 are provided below this is the first period estimated mineral resources and reserves have been developed for safi rps energy canada ltd “rps” a thirdparty firm comprising mining experts in accordance with item 1302b1 of regulation sk served as the qp and prepared the estimates of bromine mineral resources and reserves at the safi facility with an effective date of december 31 2021 a copy of the qp’s technical report summary with respect to the bromine mineral resource and reserve estimates at the safi facility dated february 7 2022 is filed as exhibit 965 to this report 

the feedstock is drawn from the dead sea a nonconventional reservoir owned by the nations of israel and jordan as such there are no specific resources owned by jbc but albemarle’s joint venture partner apc has exclusive rights granted by the hashemite kingdom of jordan to withdraw brine from the dead sea and process it to extract minerals the resource base of bromide ion estimated to be allocated to jordan’s share of the dead sea is estimated at 3549 million mt jbc is extracting approximately 1 percent of the bromine available bromide concentration in the dead sea is estimated to average approximately 5000 mgl 

the mineral reserve estimate is 489 million mt of bromine from the dead sea this estimate is based on the time available under the concession agreement with the hashemite kingdom of jordan and the processing capability of the jbc plant as only approximately one percent of the available resource is consumed as noted above the reserve estimate is based on the amount the jbc plant can produce over until the end of 2058 when the apc concession agreement ends revenues are based on a forecast bromine price ranging from 4570 to 8300 per mt  at the plant process recovery of 834 percent bromine from bromide product bromine is estimated at approximately 122100 tonnes per year bromine concentration used to calculate the reserve estimate from the dead sea was approximately 8890 mgl based on historical pumping 

key assumptions and parameters relating to the bromine mineral resources and reserves at the safi facility are discussed in sections 11 and 12 respectively of the safi technical report summary

magnolia is located in the southwest arkansas north of the center of columbia county approximately 50 miles east of texarkana and 135 miles south of little rock our facilities include two separate production plants the south plant and the west plant the south plant latitude 331775°n longitude 932161°w is accessible via us route 79 and paved local roads the west plant latitude 332648°n longitude 933151°w is accessible by us route 371 and paved local roads the decentralized well sites around the brine fields are accessed via paved arkansas highway 19 98 160 and 344 

in magnolia bromine is recovered from underground brine wells and then processed into a variety of end products at the plant on location albemarle has more than 50 brine production and injection wells that are currently active on the property albemarle’s area of bromine operation is comprised of over 9500 individual leases with local landowners comprising a total area of over 99500 acres the leases have been acquired over time as field development extended across the field each lease continues for a period of 25 years or longer until after a two year period where brine is not injected or produced fromto a well within two miles of lease land areas as long as lease rentals are continuing to be paid see section 3 of the magnolia technical report summary filed as exhibit 966 to this report for a map of leases and burdens on those leases at the magonlia site 

bromine extraction began in magnolia in 1965 as the first brine supply well was drilled and additional wells were put into production over the next few years in 1987 a predecessor company took over operations of certain brine supply and injection wells which albemarle continues to operate to this day in 2019 albemarle completed and put into production two new brine production supply wells in magnolia 

in magnolia bromine exists as sodium bromide in the formation waters or brine of the jurassic age smackover formation a geological formation in arkansas in the subsurface at 7000 to 8500 feet below sea level the mineralization occurs within the highly saline smackover formation waters or brine where the bromide has an abnormally rich composition the bromine concentration is more than twice as high as that found in normal evaporated sea water the bromine mineralization of the brine is distributed throughout the porous intervals of the upper and middle smackover on the property the strong permeability and porosity of the smackover grainstones provide excellent continuity of the bromine mineralization within the brine 

the facilities at magnolia consist of brine production and injection wells brine ponds two bromine processing plants pipelines between the plants and wells a laboratory storage and warehouses administrative offices as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment our magnolia facilities are supplied electricity from a local company and we currently have several operating freshwater wells nearby that supply water to the facilities in addition both plants have dedicated rail spurs that provide access to several rail lines to transport product throughout the country we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2021 the gross asset value of our facilities at our magnolia site was approximately 7728 million

outlook 

the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve in particular the market for lithium battery and energy storage particularly that for electric vehicles “evs” remains strong 



providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity the other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions such as slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility crude oil price fluctuation a dynamic pricing environment an everchanging landscape in electronics the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders we believe that our businesses remain wellpositioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets 

while global economic conditions have been improving the covid19 pandemic continues to have an impact globally we have not seen a material impact to our operations to date however the ultimate impact on our business will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak throughout the world all of our information technology systems are running as designed and all sites are operating at normal capacity while we continue to comply with all government and health agency recommendations and requirements as well as protecting the safety of our employees and communities we believe we have sufficient inventory to continue to produce at current levels however government mandated shutdowns could impact our ability to acquire additional materials and disrupt our customers’ purchases at this time we cannot predict the expected overall financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business but we are planning for various economic scenarios and continue to make efforts to protect the safety of our employees and the health of our business 

lithium we expect results to be higher yearoveryear during 2022 in lithium due mainly to increased volume from new capacity coming on line from la negra chile train 1 in kemerton western australia and the expected acquisition of tianyuan which includes a lithium hydroxide conversion plant designed to produce up to 25000 metric tons of lce per year we expect commercial production from this lithium hydroxide conversion plant will begin in the first half of 2022 in addition pricing is expected to increase reflecting tight market conditions and last year’s expiration of pricing concessions on longterm contracts ev sales are expected to continue to increase over the prior year as the lithium battery market remains strong 

we also announced agreements for strategic investments in china with plans to build two lithium hydroxide conversion plants each initially targeting 50000 metric tons per year subject to additional studies and approvals it is expected these plants would start construction during 2022 and complete construction by the end of 2024 in addition our 60owned marbl joint venture recently announced its intention to resume spodumene concentrate production at the wodgina spodumene mine with the production restart expected during the second quarter of 2022 in february 2022 we announced that we signed a nonbinding letter agreement with our marbl joint venture partner mrl to explore a potential expansion of the marbl joint venture in an effort to expand lithium conversion capacity with increased optionality and reduced risk 

on a longerterm basis we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and full battery electric vehicles increases this demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium ion battery costs increasing battery performance continuing significant investments in the battery and ev supply chain by cathode and battery producers and automotive oem’s favorable global public policy toward emobilityrenewable energy usage and additional stimulus measures taken in europe in light of the covid19 pandemic that we expect to strengthen ev demand our outlook is also bolstered by longterm supply agreements with key strategic customers reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner highlighted by our scale access to geographically diverse lowcost resources and longterm track record of reliability of supply and operating execution 

bromine we expect both net sales and profitability to be modestly higher in 2022 due to strength in demand for flame retardants as well as benefiting from diverse end markets volumes are expected to up slightly compared to full year 2021 due to the successful execution of growth projects in 2021 assuming continued availability of raw materials like chlorine bromine’s ongoing cost savings initiatives and higher pricing are expected to offset higher freight and raw material costs 

on a longerterm basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products our longterm drilling outlook is uncertain at this time and will follow a longterm trajectory in line with oil prices we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets the combination of our solid longterm business fundamentals strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through endmarket challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets 



catalysts total catalysts results in 2022 are expected to increase yearoveryear with overall refining markets and as travel lockdown conditions abate 2021 results for both the refining catalyst and performance catalyst solutions “pcs” businesses were negatively impacted by the us gulf coast winter storm in the first half of the year volumes are expected to grow across each of the catalysts products in addition pricing is expected to increase to offset inflationary pressures in freight and input costs in particular we expect increased natural gas prices in europe due to potential supply restrictions the fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” market is expected to gradually recover from the covid19 pandemic in line with increased travel and depletion of global gasoline inventories however demand may not return to normal levels until late 2022 or 2023 at the earliest hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” demand tends to be lumpier than fcc demand and is also expected to continue to be negatively impacted as refiners defer spending into 2022 in 2021 we initiated a strategic review of the catalysts business to position for value creation 

on a longerterm basis we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels new refinery startups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our catalysts business we believe delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry we also believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world including those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields longerterm we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio with superior technology and production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that catalysts remains wellpositioned for the future in pcs we expect growth on a longerterm basis in our organometallics business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending 

corporate we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2021 include an actuarial gain of 569 million 436 million after income taxes as compared to a loss of 523 million 409 million after income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

property plant and equipment we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash flows and discount rates among other items when acquiring mineral reserves the fair value is estimated using an excess earnings approach which requires management to estimate future cash flows net of capital investments in the specific operation management’s cash flow projections involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the 



expected production of the mine over the estimated time period sales prices shipment volumes and expected profit margins the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the preliminary fair value assigned to mineral reserves the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers a performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer the transaction price of a contract or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments if applicable for any variable consideration such as customer rebates noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer although these adjustments are generally not material where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation although these situations do not occur frequently and are generally not built into our contracts any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers which in some cases is based on established market prices sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days however they vary by market factors such as customer size creditworthiness geography and competitive environment 

all of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days costs for shipping and handling activities whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods are accounted for as fulfillment costs 

the company currently utilizes the following practical expedients as permitted by accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  

• all sales and other passthrough taxes are excluded from contract value 

• in utilizing the modified retrospective transition method no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year 

• we will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income unless if at contract inception the expected payment terms from time of delivery or other relevant criterion are more than one year 

• if our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right and 

• we expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costscompensation attributable to individual product salesshipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less 



certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer in management’s judgment control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time upon shipment or delivery and not over the time they are produced therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products 

costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less when the company incurs preproduction or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates which is less than one year we record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management in applying the goodwill impairment test we initially perform a qualitative test “step 0” where we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting units and other entity and reporting unit specific events if after assessing these qualitative factors we determine it is “morelikelythannot” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform a quantitative test “step 1” during step 1 we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates adjusted ebitda margins discount rate as well as other economic or industryrelated factors for the refining solutions reporting unit the revenue growth rates and adjusted ebitda margins were deemed to be significant assumptions significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to albemarle and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2021 and no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis as a result we concluded there was no impairment as of that date 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names and trademarks for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount during the year ended december 31 2021 no evidence of impairment was noted from the analysis for our indefinitelived intangible assets 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents and customer lists are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twentyfive years except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our lithium business which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 



resource development expenses 

we incur costs in resource exploration evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects exploration costs incurred before the declaration of proven and probable resources are generally expensed as incurred after proven and probable resources are declared exploration evaluation and development costs necessary to bring the property to commercial capacity or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized any costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred 

capitalized resource costs are depleted using the unitsofproduction method our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

• discount rate—the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 

• expected return on plan assets—we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets for these investments these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 

• rate of compensation increase—for salaryrelated plans we project employees’ annual pay increases which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement 

• mortality assumptions—assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations 

actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a monthly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2021 we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2021 the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2021 measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2021 the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans decreased to 286 and 144 respectively from 250 and 086 respectively at december 31 2020 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2021 measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 285 and 249 respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2021 and 2020 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 688 and the weightedaverage 



expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 398 and 407 respectively effective january 1 2022 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 689 and 385 respectively 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2021 and 2020 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 320 and 382 respectively for our foreign pension plans 

for the purpose of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2021 and 2020 we used the pri2012 mortality tables along with the mp2021 and mp2020 mortality improvement scale respectively published by the soa 

at december 31 2021 the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 7002 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2021 963 million or approximately 14 are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater 



than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2017 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2017 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process we have audits ongoing for the years 2011 through 2020 related to germany italy belgium south africa and chile some of which are for entities that have since been divested 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 03 million as a result of closure of tax statutes as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in 2016 we agreed to indemnify certain income and nonincome tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions associated with the entities sold the associated liability is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities see note 16 “other noncurrent liabilities” and note 21 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further details 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested we will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs funding working capital and service of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable payables and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 4393 million at december 31 2021 as compared to 7467 million at december 31 2020 cash provided by operating activities was 3443 million 7989 million and 7194 million during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to the 3325 million payment to huntsman to settle a legacy rockwood legal matter lower earnings from the fcs business sold on june 1 2021 as well as increased inventory balances and accounts receivable due to the timing of payments this was partially offset by increased sales in our lithium and bromine segments the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 versus 2019 was primarily due to lower working capital outflow including inventory reductions and the timing of receivable collections as well as the previously announced companywide cost savings initiative and increased dividends from unconsolidated investments which more than offset lower revenues in each of our reportable segments the working capital 



outflow in 2020 also included the payment of 615 million related to stamp duties in australia levied on the assets purchased as part of the acquisition of the wodgina project completed in 2019 

during 2021 cash on hand cash provided by operations net cash proceeds of 2898 million from the sale of the fcs business 3885 million of commercial paper borrowings and the 15 billion net proceeds from our underwritten public offering of common stock funded debt principal payments of approximately 15 billion early extinguishment of debt fees of 24877 3325 million of the legal settlement related to the legacy rockwood business arbitration 9537 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1779 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 303 million during 2020 cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings of 200 million from one of our credit facilities funded 8500 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1618 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 164 million in addition during 2020 we received 110 million in proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in the socc joint venture during and paid 226 million of agreed upon purchase price adjustments for the wodgina project acquisition during 2019 cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings of 160 billion funded the wodgina project acquisition discussed below 8518 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1522 million the repayment of 1752 million of senior notes and pension and postretirement contributions of 165 million in addition during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 2478 million 637 million and 2249 million respectively which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 961 million 321 million and 832 million respectively 

on june 1 2021 we completed the sale of the fcs business to grace for proceeds of approximately 570 million consisting of 300 million in cash and the issuance to albemarle of preferred equity of a grace subsidiary having an aggregate stated value of 270 million the preferred equity can be redeemed at grace’s option under certain conditions and will accrue paymentinkind dividends at an annual rate of 12 beginning on june 1 2023 two years after issuance 

on february 8 2021 we completed an underwritten public offering of 8496773 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 15300 per share we also granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1274509 shares which was exercised the total gross proceeds from this offering were approximately 15 billion before deducting expenses underwriting discounts and commissions in the first quarter of 2021 we made the following debt principal payments using the net proceeds from this underwritten public offering 

• €1238 million of the 1125 notes due in november 2025 

• €3930 million the remaining balance of the 1875 senior notes originally due in december 2021 

• 1284 million of the 345 senior notes due in november 2029 

• 2000 million the remaining balance of the floating rate notes originally due in november 2022 

• €1833 million the outstanding balance of the unsecured credit facility originally entered into on august 14 2019 as amended and restated on december 15 2020 the “2019 credit facility” 

• 3250 million the outstanding balance of the commercial paper notes 

on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in the wodgina project for a total purchase price of 13 billion the purchase price is comprised of 820 million in cash and the transfer of 40 interest in certain lithium hydroxide conversion assets being built by albemarle in kemerton western australia valued at approximately 480 million in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we paid 226 million of agreed upon purchase price adjustments the cash consideration was funded by the unsecured credit facility entered into on august 14 2019 

in november 2019 we issued notes totaling 5000 million and €10 billion the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay the 10 billion balance of the unsecured credit facility entered into on august 14 2019 a large portion of approximately 370 million of commercial paper notes the remaining balance of 1752 million of the senior notes issued on december 10 2010 “2010 senior notes” and for general corporate purposes during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 48 million in interest and financing expenses representing the tender premiums fees unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2010 senior notes 

capital expenditures were 9537 million 8505 million and 8518 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development 



we expect our capital expenditures to be between 13 billion and 15 billion in 2022 primarily for lithium growth and capacity increases primarily in australia china and silver peak nevada as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments train i of our kemerton western australia plant was completed in december 2021 but due to the ongoing labor shortages and covid19 pandemic travel restrictions in western australia train ii construction is now expected to be completed in the second half of 2022 commercial sales volume from train i will begin in 2022 and train ii in 2023 

during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we incurred 127 million 173 million and 207 million of costs related to the acquisition integration and potential divestitures for various significant projects including the acquisition of the wodgina project in 2019 which primarily consisted of professional services and advisory fees 

the company is permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15000000 shares under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors there were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2021 2020 or 2019 at december 31 2021 there were 7396263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the company’s authorized share repurchase program 

net current assets decreased to approximately 1336 million at december 31 2021 from 4043 million at december 31 2020 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents to pay a portion of the legacy rockwood legal matter and for capital expenditures as well as the increase in accrued expenses for the remaining payment of the legacy rockwood legal matter this was partially offset by the repayment of the current portion of longterm debt using proceeds from our underwritten public offering of our common stock additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 our cash and cash equivalents included 3740 million and 4928 million respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we repatriated approximately 09 million 18 million and 3519 million of cash respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have the following notes outstanding 

a denotes senior notes 

our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each series of notes 



outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of these notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing these notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the series of notes plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures these notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default 

our euro notes issued in 2019 are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all our other unsecured senior obligations the euro notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each series of notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis using the bond rate as defined in the indentures governing these notes plus between 25 and 35 basis points depending on the series of notes plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to but excluding the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures these notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness exceeding 100 million caused by a nonpayment default

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum 



aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company the credit agreements are available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 175 billion current maximum amount available under the credit agreements the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2021 we had 3885 million of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 046 and a weightedaverage maturity of 20 days the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2021 and 2020 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 200 billion at december 31 2021 compared to 277 billion at december 31 2020 in addition at december 31 2021 we had the ability to borrow 136 billion under our commercial paper program and the credit agreements and 2106 million under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our credit agreements we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the credit agreements as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2021 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 812 million at december 31 2021 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make acquisitions make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future our main focus during the continued uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic is to continue to maintain financial flexibility by continuing our cost savings initiative while still protecting our employees and customers committing to shareholder returns and maintaining an investment grade rating over the next three years in terms of uses of cash we will continue to invest in growth of the businesses and return value to shareholders additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

our growth investments include the recently announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of tianyuan for approximately 200 million in cash tianyuans operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant that has designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25000 metric tons of lce and is capable of producing batterygrade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide we expect the transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions to close in the first half of 2022 in addition we announced agreements for strategic investments in china with plans to build two lithium hydroxide conversion plants each initially targeting 50000 metric tons per year we expect construction of these conversion plants to begin in 2022 and be completed by the end of 2024 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before november 2024 we believe we have and will be able to maintain a solid liquidity position our annual maturities of longterm debt as of december 31 2021 are as follows in millions 2022—3899 2023—00 2024—4250 2025—4266 2026—00 thereafter—11664 obligations in 2022 primarily include our outstanding commercial paper notes of 3885 million with a weighted average maturity of 20 days in addition we expect to make interest payments on those longterm debt obligations as follows in millions 2022—585 2023—566 2024—551 2025—385 2026—341 thereafter—3781 for variablerate debt obligations projected interest payments are calculated using the december 31 2021 weighted average interest rate of approximately 040 

in addition we expect our capital expenditures to be between 13 billion and 15 billion in 2022 primarily for lithium growth and capacity increases primarily in australia china and silver peak nevada as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments train i of our kemerton western australia plant was completed in december 2021 but due to the ongoing labor shortages and covid19 pandemic travel restrictions in western australia train ii construction is now 



expected to be completed in the second half of 2022 commercial sales volume from train i will begin in 2022 and train ii in 2023 as of december 31 2021 we have also committed to approximately 994 million of payments to thirdparty vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes with approximately 783 million to be paid in 2022 in order to secure materials sometimes for long durations these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe 

see note 18 “leases” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for our annual expected payments under our operating lease obligations at december 31 2021 

in 2022 we expect to pay 238 million of the 2580 million balance remaining from the transition tax on foreign earnings as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” signed into law in december 2017 the onetime transition tax imposed by the tcja is based on our total post1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from us income taxes and is payable over an eightyear period with the final payment made in 2026 

contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan are expected to approximate 12 million in 2022 we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 276 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2021 

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 277 million and 147 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 329 million and 241 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our liquidity to date however we cannot predict the overall impact in terms of cash flow generation as that will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak as a result we are planning for various economic scenarios and actively monitoring our balance sheet to maintain the financial flexibility needed 

although we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions as sources of financing an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments to us decline funding under our existing but uncommitted lines of credit with them not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing to us while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic or global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature if the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits 

on february 6 2017 huntsman a subsidiary of huntsman corporation filed a lawsuit in new york state court against rockwood rockwood specialties inc certain former executives of rockwood and its subsidiaries—seifollah ghasemi thomas riordan andrew ross and michael valente and albemarle the lawsuit arises out of huntsman’s acquisition of certain rockwood subsidiaries in connection with a stock purchase agreement the “spa” dated september 17 2013 before that transaction closed on october 1 2014 albemarle began discussions with rockwood to purchase all outstanding equity of rockwood and did so in a transaction that closed on january 12 2015 huntsman’s complaint asserted that certain technology that rockwood had developed for a production facility in augusta georgia and which was among the assets that huntsman acquired pursuant to the spa did not work and that rockwood and the defendant executives had intentionally misled huntsman about that technology in connection with the huntsmanrockwood transaction the complaint asserted claims for among other things fraud negligent misrepresentation and breach of the spa and sought certain costs for completing construction of the production facility 

on march 10 2017 albemarle moved in new york state court to compel arbitration which was granted on january 8 2018 although huntsman unsuccessfully appealed that decision huntsman’s arbitration demand asserted claims substantially similar to those asserted in its state court complaint and sought various forms of legal remedies including cost overruns compensatory damages expectation damages punitive damages and restitution after a trial the arbitration panel issued an 



award on october 28 2021 awarding approximately 600 million including interest to be paid by albemarle to huntsman in addition to the possibility of attorney’s fees costs and expenses following the arbitration panel decision albemarle reached a settlement with huntsman to pay 665 million in two equal installments with the first payment made in december 2021 as a result the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2021 includes expense of 6574 million 5085 million net of income tax inclusive of legal fees incurred by huntsman and other related obligations to reflect the agreed upon resolution of this legal matter 

in addition as first reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by thirdparty sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the foreign corrupt practices act and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of thirdparty sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and the dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and the dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures we have commenced discussions with the sec about a potential resolution 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations we also are unable to predict what action may be taken by the doj the sec or the dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may ultimately seek any determination that our operations or activities are not or were not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity however an adverse resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 4393 million as of december 31 2021 of which 3740 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 432 million 449 million and 480 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2021 totaled approximately 466 million an increase of 08 million from 458 million at december 31 2020 see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 554 million 404 million and 444 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen chinese renminbi australian dollar and chilean peso in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged in the fourth quarter of 2019 we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of nonfunctional currency purchases during the construction of the kemerton plant in australia this contract has been designated as an effective hedging instrument and beginning the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of this contract to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss all other gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as an effective hedging instrument are recognized in other expenses net and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2021 our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 6546 million and with a fair value representing a net asset position of 28 million fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2021 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately 336 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase of approximately 380 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2021 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date 



of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2021 we repaid the outstanding balance of these senior notes and as a result this net investment hedge was discontinued the balance of foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses associated with this discontinued net investment hedge will remain within accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 3937 million and 7566 million outstanding at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively these borrowings represented 16 and 21 of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 040 and 087 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 39 million as of december 31 2021 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

our bromine business serves markets in the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace our most significant competitors are lanxess ag and israel chemicals ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the bromine we use is originally sourced from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our bromine production operations in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in safi jordan we acquire bromine that is originally sourced from the dead sea jbc processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products see item 2 properties regarding additional disclosures for our arkansas bromine mineral property 

catalysts segment 

our three main product lines in this segment are i clean fuels technologies “cft” which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” together with isomerization and akylation catalysts ii fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” catalysts and additives and iii performance catalyst solutions “pcs” which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives 

we offer a wide range of hpc products which are applied throughout the oil refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes we continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market 

we provide our customers with customized fcc catalyst systems which assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like 



propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs 

within our pcs product line we manufacture organometallic cocatalysts eg aluminum magnesium and zinc alkyls used in the manufacture of alphaolefins eg hexene octene decene polyolefins eg polyethylene and polypropylene and electronics our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes epoxies and other engineered resins as previously announced we are pursuing opportunities to divest pcs 

there were more than 600 refineries worldwide in 2020 we expect to continue to see some less profitable typically smaller refineries shutting down and over the longterm be replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries with growth concentrated in the middle east and asia oil refinery utilization was lower in 2020 compared to the previous year with most refineries cutting throughput due to the reduction in demand resulting from global travel restrictions to contain the covid19 pandemic we estimate that there are currently approximately 600 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3000 hpc units being operated globally or a capacity of approximately 46 million barrels per day each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to four years 

competition 

our catalysts segment serves the global market including the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive competition in these markets is driven by a variety factors product performance and quality price and contract terms product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace in addition through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

our major competitors in the cft catalysts market include shell catalysts  technologies advanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co basf corporation and china petrochemical corporation sinopec in the pcs market our major competitors include nouryon lanxess ag and lonza 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin aluminum ethylene alphaolefins isobutylene toluene and metals such as lanthanum molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility 

human capital 

our main human capital management objectives are to attract retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe supported and empowered to do the best work they can do we believe providing a diverse equal and inclusive workplace facilitates opportunities for innovation fosters good decision making practices and promotes employee engagement and high productivity across our organization 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 5900 employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures of whom 2800 or 47 are employed in the us and the americas 1400 or 24 are employed in europe 1300 or 22 are employed in asia pacific and 400 or 7 are employed in the middle east or other areas approximately 42 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils we believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees and with those unions and works councils 

health and safety 

the health and safety of our employees is a part of our core values at albemarle and is integral to how we conduct business our employees contractors and visitors follow a comprehensive set of written health and safety policies and procedures at both the corporate and local site levels we routinely audit ourselves against our policies procedures and standards using internal and thirdparty resources we also include health and safety metrics in our annual incentive plan for all employees to incentivize our commitment to safety in 2020 we improved our occupational safety and health act “osha” occupational injury and illness incident rate to 026 for our employees and nested contractors compared to 033 in 2019 in 



addition we provide all employees and their dependents with access to our employee assistance program which provides free mental and behavioral health resources 

in response to the covid19 pandemic albemarle created a crossfunctional global response team which has met biweekly since april 2020 to assess the situation and take necessary actions to address employee health and safety and operational challenges our first priority is always the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and communities since the start of the pandemic our focus has shifted from managing an immediate crisis to building in the flexibility needed to adjust for regional differences and changing conditions protocols that include restricted travel shift adjustments increased hygiene and social distancing for the essential workers at our plants have been put in place at all locations in some regions employees are able to return to their work sites other regions including most of north and south america remain on workfromhome protocols for nonessential personnel 

diversity equity and inclusion 

in 2020 we hired a vice president diversity and inclusion to accelerate our inclusion and diversity initiatives and deliver meaningful change in our global organization our primary focus in our recruiting efforts is to drive greater diversity in our workforce including higher representation in the professional and managerial job categories we want to ensure that our workplace reflects the communities in which we live and work our recruiting policy includes a requirement that we include individuals from gender or racial minority groups among those we interview for openings at the manager level and above 

we seek to provide employees with a desirable workplace that will enable us to attract and retain top talent we believe employees should be compensated through wages and benefits based on experience expertise performance and the criticality of their roles in the company we also perform an annual review of our pay practices to ensure that they are fair and equitable and not influenced by biased opinions or discrimination in addition we have established employee groups known as connect groups to promote an atmosphere of inclusion and encouragement in which every employee’s voice can be heard these connect groups provide opportunities for employees to share their backgrounds experiences and beliefs and to use them to benefit others through mentoring and volunteering in the local community among other activities 

investment in talent 

investing in talent is a critical process for albemarle because it allows us to be proactive and anticipate key organizational needs for talent and capabilities this enables us to efficiently and effectively ensure that we have the right talent pipeline to drive albemarle’s success into the future we also provide leadership development through performance coaching 360degree feedback and experiential development and mentoring our leadership development is a cornerstone to our talent management strategy 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales and technical personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers globally we also utilize commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas when necessary or required by law 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2020 we owned approximately 2100 active patents and approximately 550 pending patent applications in key 



strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the osha we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program as noted above we finished 2020 with an osha occupational injury and illness incident rate of 026 for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 033 in 2019 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

the toxic substances control act “tsca” as amended in june 2016 requires chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation this regulation and other pending initiatives at the us state level as well as initiatives in canada asia and other regions will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have 



liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further details 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities we provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

during recent years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries in addition we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses which do not fit our high priority business growth profile following is a summary of our significant acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures over the last three years 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we divested our ownership interest in the saudi organometallic chemicals company llc “socc” joint venture for cash proceeds of 110 million as a result of this divestiture the company recorded a gain of 72 million in other expenses net during the year ended december 31 2020 

on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in mrl’s wodgina project in western australia for a total purchase price of approximately 13 billion as part of this acquisition we formed marbl an unincorporated joint venture with mrl for the exploration development mining processing and production of lithium and other minerals other than iron ore and tantalum from the wodgina project and for the operation of the kemerton assets 

on april 3 2018 we completed the sale of the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of the pcs business “polyolefin catalysts divestiture” to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million the sale did not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business 

these transactions reflect our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses maintaining leverage flexibility and returning capital to our shareholders

 item 1a risk factors tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us with approximately 76 of our sales to foreign countries we operate andor sell our products to customers in approximately 75 countries we currently have many production facilities research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the us as detailed in item 2 properties accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency 

• transportation and other shipping costs may increase or transportation may be inhibited 

• increased cost or decreased availability of raw materials 

• changes in foreign laws and tax rates or us laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed impose new and additional taxes on remittances repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits 

• foreign countries in which we do business may adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment including currency exchange controls 

• trade sanctions by or against these countries could result in our losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries 

• unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur 

• our agreements with counterparties in foreign countries may be difficult for us to enforce and related receivables may be difficult for us to collect 

• compliance with the variety of foreign laws and regulations may be unduly burdensome 

• compliance with antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act as well as antimoneylaundering laws may be costly 

• unexpected adverse changes in export duties quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses may occur 

• general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries 

• our foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes 

• termination or substantial modification of international trade agreements may adversely affect our access to raw materials and to markets for our products outside the us 

• foreign governments may nationalize or expropriate private enterprises 

• increased sovereign risk such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments may occur and 

• political or economic repercussions from terrorist activities including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability may occur in certain countries in which we do business 

in addition certain of our operations and we have ongoing capital projects in regions of the world such as the middle east and south america that are of high risk due to significant civil political and security instability unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 



furthermore we are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery and antitrust prohibitions of the us and other countries as well as export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will in part depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities which could adversely impact us furthermore other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to do so or may be delayed in doing so in addition raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 

competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

we compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins and profitability our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

in addition albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims whether with or without merit against our company or its products imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us or are otherwise disparaging of our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing end markets as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all as may be required to replace or enhance existing products and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position 



in addition our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

despite our efforts we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace furthermore ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

the development of nonlithium battery technologies could adversely affect us 

the development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues current and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input alternative materials and technologies are being researched with the goal of making batteries lighter more efficient faster charging and less expensive and some of these could be less reliant on lithium compounds we cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and on what time horizon commercialized battery technologies that use no or significantly less lithium could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues 

adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a global regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national regional and global economies including economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 

downturns in our customers’ industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries which are cyclical in nature or which are subject to secular market downturns historically cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to four years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 



regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union “eu” continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under reach which imposes obligations on eu manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the eu to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain see “regulation” in item 1 business our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the eu requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

the tsca requires chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation this regulation and other pending initiatives at the us state level as well as initiatives in canada asia and other regions could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers 



our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation as well as natural resource extraction including explosions fires severe weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of disruptions shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous us and nonus national federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties we currently use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities including for example current and prior property owners or operators as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify 

further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing registrationapproval requirements transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years we expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 



at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar foreign anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management if we are found to be liable for violations of the fcpa or other applicable anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our joint ventures we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as first reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the us department of justice “doj” the sec and dutch public prosecutor “dpp” and are cooperating with the doj the sec and the dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses 

we are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business 

we are subject to government regulation in nonus jurisdictions in which we conduct our business the requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses or require changes in business practice in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries or their enforcement may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 



we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise in addition our trade secrets and knowhow may be improperly obtained by other means such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft 

our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability 

our lithium reserves will without more decline as we continue to extract these raw materials accordingly our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably once a site with potential resources is discovered it may take several years of development until production is possible during which time the economic viability of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

we utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project the actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as but not limited to changes in volumes grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made adverse geotechnical conditions availability supply and cost of water and power fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development changes in royalty agreements laws andor regulations around royalties and other taxes and weather or severe climate impacts 

for our existing operations we utilize geological and metallurgical assumptions financial projections and price estimates these estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material revisions to environmental obligations changes in legislation andor social political or economic environment and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable reserves including many factors beyond our control that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges 

there is risk to the growth of lithium markets 

our lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium batteries and the growth in demand for plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles to the extent that such development adoption and growth do not occur in the volume andor manner that we contemplate the longterm growth in the markets for 



lithium products may be adversely affected which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

demand and market prices for lithium will greatly affect the value of our investment in our lithium resources and our ability to develop it successfully 

our ability to successfully develop our lithium resources including recently acquired 60 interest in mrl’s wodgina project and generate a return on investment will be affected by changes in the demand for and market price of lithiumbased end products such as lithium hydroxide the market price of these products can fluctuate and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control primarily world supply and demand such external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns various political developments and macroeconomic circumstances in addition the price of lithium products is impacted by their purity and performance we may not be able to effectively mitigate against such fluctuations 

following the wodgina acquisition we announced that based on current market conditions the wodgina mine would idle production of spodumene until market demand supports bringing the mine back into production there can be no assurance that the market demand for lithium will improve or that the wodgina mine will be put back into production in the future or at all delays in putting the mine into production as well as continued fluctuations in demand for and pricing of lithium and related products may affect the value of our investment in the wodgina project and our value as a whole 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team in light of the specialized and technical nature of our business our performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

some of our employees are unionized represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 5900 employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures approximately 42 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 



risks related to our financial condition 

our required capital expenditures can be complex may experience delays or other difficulties and the costs may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment facilities and properties and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment facilities and properties execution of these capital expenditures can be complex and commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products in addition our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including crossdefaults to other debt facilities see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the eu euro japanese yen chinese renminbi australian dollar and chilean peso exchange rates between 



these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 23 of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to periods prior to our 2015 acquisition of rockwood holdings inc “rockwood” these indemnity obligations will continue generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity our earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the applicable tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 



our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings which may be material in the future the outcome of proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables 

legal and regulatory proceedings whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other resources inhibit our ability to sell our products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and otherwise negatively affect our business 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us uk germany belgium and japan we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 24 million of required cash contributions during 2021 for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2021 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs and support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 



the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

• potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• unforeseen claims and liabilities including unexpected environmental exposures 

• unforeseen adjustments charges and writeoffs 

• problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities 

• unexpected losses of customers of or suppliers to the acquired business 

• difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses’ standards processes procedures and controls with our operations 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting 

• inability to coordinate new product and process development 

• loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and 

• challenges arising from the increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants in addition the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences and risks for us including 

• reducing flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses the competitive environment and the industries in which we operate and to technological and other changes 

• lowering credit ratings 

• reducing access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future operating and capital expenses and for general corporate purposes 

• reducing funds available for operations capital expenditures share repurchases dividends and other activities and 

• creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition 

general risk factors 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches information technology system failures or network disruptions 

attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and 



networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

in addition risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and around the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program “cfats program” which is administered by the department of homeland security “dhs” identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 “cfats act” was enacted dhs has enacted new rules under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of the uss chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we have implemented all necessary changes to comply with the rules under the cfats program to date however we cannot determine with certainty any future costs associated with any additional security measures that dhs may require 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and the markets for our products in particular the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption the extent to which it impacts our business results of operations financial position and cash flows is difficult to predict and dependent upon many factors over which we have no control these factors include but are not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic government restrictions on businesses and individuals the health and safety of our employees and communities in which we do business the impact of the pandemic on our customers businesses and the resulting demand for our products the impact on our suppliers and supply chain network the impact on us and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery and potential adverse effects on the financial markets 



the company has taken and plans to continue to take certain measures to maintain financial flexibility including delaying certain capital expenditure projects and accelerating our cost savings initiative while still protecting our employees and customers however if conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic worsen and the company’s earnings and cash flow from operations do not start to recover as contemplated in the companys current plans the company may not be able to maintain compliance with its financial covenants and could be required to seek additional amendments to the credit agreements if the company were not able to obtain any such necessary additional amendments that would lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the company to repay its outstanding debt in that situation the company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay the lenders 

natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our results of operations 

the occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes floods or earthquakes pandemics such as the recent outbreak of covid19 or other unanticipated catastrophes at any of the locations in which we or our key partners suppliers and customers do business could cause interruptions in our operations historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes and our operations in asia could be subject to weather events such as typhoons a global or regional pandemic or similar outbreak in a region of our our customers or our suppliers could disrupt business if similar or other weather events natural disasters or other catastrophe events occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and other insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and coverage limits we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations in addition we have operations in the eu brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented or may implement measures to achieve objectives under the 2015 paris climate agreement an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities and fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 



economic conditions and regulatory changes relating to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our business 

following a referendum in 2016 voters in the united kingdom “uk” approved that country’s exit from the eu a process often referred to as “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 subject to a 11month transition period following completion of the transition period the uk’s withdrawal from the eu was completed on december 31 2020 the future effects of brexit will depend on the effect and implementation of the eu–uk trade and cooperation agreement which was agreed between the uk and eu on december 24 2020 formally ratified by the uk parliament on december 30 2020 and expected to be formally approved by the eu parliament in the first quarter of 2021 although the euuk trade and cooperation agreement provides some clarity with respect to aspects of the future relationship between the uk and the eu including with respect to free trade in goods limited mutual market access in services and cooperation mechanisms in a range of policy areas much uncertainty remains about what financial trade and legal implications brexit will have and how it will affect the future relationship between the uk and eu we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside the us including 17 from eu countries the consequences of brexit could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets including volatility in foreign currencies and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations operating results and financial condition all of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the eu

significant mineral properties 

set forth below are details regarding our significant mineral properties operated by us and our affiliates in accordance with industry guide 7 issued by the securities and exchange commission “sec” in 2018 the sec adopted new rules relating to property disclosures by companies with significant mining operations effective for the year beginning january 1 2021 thus the company will not be required to comply with the sec’s new mining operation disclosure rules until the earlier of its next filing of a registration statement under the securities act of 1933 or the filing of its annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2021 the company does not have current estimates of proven or probable reserves for its significant mining properties as defined by industry guide 7 as of this filing however the company is in the process of developing these reserve estimates in accordance with the new mining operation rules adopted by the sec 



greenbushes australia 

the greenbushes mine is a hard rock open pit mine located approximately 250km south of perth western australia 90km southeast of the port of bunbury a major bulkhandling port in the southwest of western australia the lithium mining operation is near the greenbushes townsite located in the shire of bridgetowngreenbushes access to the greenbushes mine is via the paved south western highway between bunbury and bridgetown to greenbushes township and via the paved maranup ford road to the greenbushes mine 

lithium production from the greenbushes mine has been undertaken continuously for more than 20 years modern exploration has been undertaken on the property since the mid1980s first by greenbushes limited then by lithium australia ltd and in turn by sons of gwalia prior to the acquisition of greenbushes by talison in 2007 initial exploration focused largely on tantalum with the emphasis changing to lithium from around 2000 in 2014 rockwood acquired a 49 ownership interest in windfield which owns 100 of talison from sichuan tianqi lithium industries inc this 49 ownership in windfield was assumed by albemarle in 2015 as part of the acquisition of rockwood we purchase lithium concentrate from windfield and our investment in the joint venture is reported as an unconsolidated equity investment on our balance sheet 

about 55 of the tenements held by talison are covered by western australia’s state forest which is under the authority of the western australia department of biodiversity conservation and attractions the majority of the remaining land is private land that covers about 40 of the surface rights the remaining ground comprises crown land road reserves and other miscellaneous reserves the tenements cover a total area of approximately 10000 hectares and include the historic greenbushes tin tantalum and current lithium mining areas talison holds the mining rights for all lithium minerals on these tenements the operating lithium mining and processing plant area covers approximately 2000 hectares comprising three mining leases all lithium mining activities including tailings storage processing plant operations open pits and waste rock dumps are currently carried out within the boundaries of the three mining leases plus two general purpose leases in order to keep the granted tenements in good standing talison is required to maintain permits make an annual contribution to the statutory mining rehabilitation fund and pay a royalty on concentrate sales for lithium mineral production as prescribed under the mining act 



1978 in western australia there are no private royalties that apply to the greenbushes property talison reviews and renews all tenements on an annual basis 

the greenbushes deposit consists of a main raremetal zoned pegmatite body with numerous smaller footwall pegmatite dykes and pods the primary intrusion and its subsidiary dykes and pods are concentrated within shear zones on the boundaries of granofels ultramafic schists and amphibolites the pegmatites are crosscut by ferrousrich mafic dolerite which is of paramount importance to the currant mining methods the pegmatite body is over 3 km long north by northwest up to 300 meters wide normal to dip strikes north to northwest and dips moderately to steeply west to southwest 

the major minerals from the greenbushes pegmatite are quartz spodumene albite and kfeldspar the main lithiumbearing minerals are spodumene containing approximately 8 lithium oxide and varieties kunzite and hiddenite minor to trace lithium minerals include lepidolite mica amblygonite and lithiophilite lithium is readily leached in the weathering environment and thus is virtually nonexistent in weathered pegmatite exploration drilling at greenbushes has been ongoing for over 40 years including drilling in 2020 using reverse circulation and diamond drill holes 

three lithium mineral processing plants are currently operating on the greenbushes site two chemical grade plants and a technical grade plant tailings are discharged to the tailings storage facility without the need for any neutralization process additional infrastructure on site includes power and water supply facilities a laboratory administrative offices occupational healthsafetytraining offices dedicated mines rescue area stores storage sheds workshops and engineering offices the greenbushes site also leases production drills excavators trucks and various support equipment to extract the ore deposit by open pit methods talison’s power is delivered by a local distribution system and reticulated and metered within the site water is sourced from rainfall and stored in several process dams located on site we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2020 the gross asset value of the facilities at the greenbushes site was approximately 789 million during 2020 88000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent “lce” of lithium concentrate were produced at the greenbushes facilities talison currently sells the lithium concentrate only to its shareholders 

talison ships the chemicalgrade lithium concentrate in vessels to our facilities in meishan and xinyu china to process into batterygrade lithium hydroxide in addition the output from talison can be used by tolling entities in china to produce both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide see a description of our facilities in meishan and xinyu below under “other significant lithium processing facilities” 



salar de atacamala negra chile 

the salar de atacama is located in the commune of san pedro de atacama at the eastern end of the antofagasta region and close to the border of argentina and bolivia access to the property is on the major fourlane paved panamericana route 5 north from antofagasta chile approximately 60 km northeast to b385 on b385 a two laned paved highway the albemarle salar de atacama project is approximately 175 km to the east the site has a small private airport that serves the project a small paved runway airport is also located near san pedro de atacama and a large international airport is located in antofagasta the la negra plant has direct access roads and located approximately 20 km by paved four lane highway route 28 southeast of antofagasta turning north approximately 3 km on route 5 

in the early 1960s water with high concentrations of salts was discovered in the salar de atacama basin in january 1975 one of our predecessors foote mineral company signed a longterm contract with the chilean government for mineral rights with respect to the salar de atacama consisting exclusively of the right to access lithium brine covering an area of approximately 16700 hectares the contract originally permitted the production and sale of up to 200000 metric tons of lithium metal equivalent “lme” a calculated percentage of lce in 1981 the first construction of evaporation ponds in the salar de atacama began the following year the construction of the lithium carbonate plant in la negra began in 1990 the facilities at the salar de atacama were expanded with a new well system and the capacity of the lithium carbonate plant in the la negra plant was expanded in 1998 the lithium chloride plant in la negra began operating the same year that chemetall purchased foote mineral company subsequently in 2004 chemetall was acquired by rockwood and in 2015 rockwood was acquired by albemarle effective january 1 2017 the chilean government and albemarle entered into an annex to the original agreement through which its duration was modified extending it until the balance of a the original 200000 metric tons of lme and an additional 262132 metric tons of lme granted through this annex have been exploited processed and sold or b on january 1 2044 whichever comes first in addition the amended agreement provides for commission payments to the chilean government based on sales pricemetric ton on the amounts sold under the additional quota granted our support of research and development in chile of lithium applications and solar energy and our support of local communities in 



northern chile albemarle currently operates its extraction and production facilities in chile under this mineral rights agreement with the chilean government 

the salar de atacama is a salt flat the largest in chile located in the atacama desert in northern chile which is the driest place on the planet and thus has an extremely high annual rate of evaporation and extremely low annual rainfall our extraction through evaporation process works as follows snow in the andes mountains melts and flows into underground pools of water containing brine which generally have high concentrations of lithium we then pump the water containing brine above ground through a series of pumps and wells into a network of large evaporation ponds over the course of approximately eighteen months the desert sun evaporates the water causing other salts to precipitate and leaving behind concentrated lithium brine if weather conditions are not favorable the evaporation process may be prolonged after we obtain the lithium brine from the salar de atacama we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at our manufacturing facilities in nearby la negra chile 

the filling materials of the salar de atacama basin are dominated by the vilama formation and the more recently in geologic time by evaporitic and clastic materials that are currently being deposited in the basin these units house the basins aquifer system and are composed of evaporitic chemical sediments that include carbonate gypsum and halite intervals interrupted by volcanic deposits of large sheets of ignimbrite volcanic ash and smaller classical deposits lithiumrich brines are extracted from the halite aquifer that is located within the nucleus of the salt flat the salar de atacama basin contains a continental system of lithiumrich brine these types of systems have six common global characteristics arid climate closed basin that contains a salt flat salt crust a salt lake or both igneous andor hydrothermal activity tectonic subsidence suitable sources of lithium and sufficient time to concentrate the lithium in the brine 

in the salar de atacama basin lithiumrich brines are found in a halite aquifer carbonate and sulfates are found near the edges of the basin the average minimum and maximum concentrations of lithium in the salar de atacama basin are approximately 1400 900 and 7000 mgl respectively from 2017 through 2019 two drilling campaigns were carried out in order to obtain geological and hydrogeological information at the albemarle mining concession 

the facilities at the salar de atacama consist of extraction wells evaporation and concentration ponds leaching plants a potash plant a drying floor services and general areas including salt stockpiles as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment the extracted concentrated lithium brine is sent to the la negra plant by truck for processing the salar de atacama has its own powerhouse that generates the energy necessary for the entire operation of the facilities we also have permanent and continuous groundwater exploitation rights for two wells that are for industrial use and to supply the salar de atacama facilities the la negra facilities consist of a boron removal plant a calcium and magnesium removal plant two lithium carbonate conversion plants a lithium chloride plant evaporationsedimentation ponds an offsite area where the raw materials are housed and the inputs that are used in the process are prepared a dry area where the various products are prepared as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment la negra is supplied electricity from a local company and has rights to a well in the peine community for its water supply we are currently constructing a third lithium carbonate conversion plant expected to be completed mid2021 followed by a sixmonth commissioning and qualification process we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2020 the combined gross asset value of our facilities at the salar de atacama and in la negra chile not inclusive of construction in process was approximately 863 million during 2020 we produced 42000 metric tons of lce of primarily lithium carbonate at our la negra facilities 



silver peak nevada 

the silver peak site is located in a rural area approximately 30 miles southwest of tonopah in esmeralda county nevada it is located in the clayton valley an arid valley historically covered with dry lake beds playas the operation borders the small unincorporated town of silver peak nevada albemarle uses the silver peak site for the production of lithium brines which are used to make lithium carbonate and to a lesser degree lithium hydroxide access to the site is off of the paved highway sr265 in the town of silver peak nevada the administrative offices are located on the south side of the road the process facility is on the north side of the road and the brine operations are located approximately three miles east of silver peak on silver peak road and occupy both the north and south sides of the road in addition access to the site is also possible via graveldirt roads from tonopah nevada and goldfield nevada 

lithium brine extraction in the clayton valley began in the mid1960’s by one of our predecessors the foote mineral company since that time lithium brine operations have been operated on a continuous basis in 1998 chemetall purchased foote mineral company subsequently in 2004 chemetall was acquired by rockwood and in 2015 rockwood was acquired by albemarle our mineral rights in silver peak consist of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to our permitted and certified senior water rights a settlement agreement with the us government originally entered into in june 1991 and our patented and unpatented land claims pursuant to the 1991 agreement our water rights and our land claims we have rights to all lithium that we can remove economically from the clayton valley basin in nevada we have been operating at the silver peak site since 1966 our silver peak site covers a surface of over 13500 acres more than 10500 acres of which we own through a subsidiary the remaining acres are owned by the us government from whom we lease the land pursuant to unpatented land claims that are renewed annually actual surface disturbance associated with the operations is 7390 acres primarily associated with the evaporation ponds the manufacturing and administrative activities are confined to an area approximately 20 acres in size 



we extract lithium brine from our silver peak site through substantially the same evaporation process we use at the salar de atacama we process the lithium brine extracted from our silver peak site into lithium carbonate at our plant in silver peak it is hypothesized that the current levels of lithium dissolved in brine originate from relatively recent dissolution of halite by meteoric waters that have penetrated the playa in the last 10000 years the halite formed in the playa during the aforementioned climatic periods of low precipitation and that the concentrated lithium was incorporated as liquid inclusions into the halite crystals there are no current exploration activities on the silver peak lithium operation however in january 2021 we announced that we will expand capacity in silver peak and begin a program to evaluate clays and other available nevada resources for commercial production of lithium beginning in 2021 we plan to invest 30 million to 50 million to double the current production in silver peak by 2025 with the aim of making full use of the brine water rights 

the facilities at silver peak consist of extraction wells evaporation and concentration ponds a lithium carbonate plant a lithium anhydrous plant a lithium hydroxide plant a liming plant wellfield and mill maintenance a shipping and packaging facility and administrative offices as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment silver peak is supplied electricity from a local company and we currently have two operating fresh water wells nearby that supply water to the facilities we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2020 the gross asset value of our facilities at our silver peak site was approximately 55 million during 2020 we produced approximately 2200 metric tons of lce of lithium carbonate at our silver peak facilities 

wodgina australia 

the wodgina property is located approximately 110 km southsoutheast of port hedland western australia between the turner and yule rivers the area includes multiple prominent greenstone ridges up to 180 m above mean sea level surrounded by granitic plains and lowlands the property is accessible via national highway 1 to national highway 95 to the wodgina 



camp road all roads to site are paved the nearest large regional airport is in port hedland which also hosts an international deepwater port facility in addition a site dedicated allweather airstrip is located onsite capable of landing certain aircrafts 

the wodgina pegmatite deposits were discovered in 1902 since then the pegmatitehosted deposits have been mined for tin tantalum beryl and lithium by various companies mining occurred sporadically until goldrim mining formed a new partnership with pan west tantalum pty ltd who opened open pit mining at the site in 1989 and progressively expanded during the 1990s active mining at the mt cassiterite pit has been started and stopped regularly between 2008 and the present the mine was placed on care and maintenance in 2008 2012 and most recently in 2019 in 2016 mrl acquired the mine and upgraded the processing facilities and site infrastructure to 750ktpa spodumene plant producing 6 spodumene concentrate completed in 2019 on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in this hard rock lithium mine project and formed an unincorporated joint venture with mrl named marbl we formed marbl for the exploration development mining processing and production of lithium and other minerals other than iron ore and tantalum from the wodgina project since the acquisition we have idled marbl’s production of spodumene until market demand supports bringing the mine back into production no mining or processing operations are active 

wodgina holds mining tenements within the karriyarra native title claim and are subject to the land use agreement dated march 2001 between the karriyarra people and gwalia tantalum ltd now wodgina lithium a 100 subsidiary of mrl our marbl joint venture partner all mining and exploration land tenements are in good standing and no known impediments exist certain tenements are due for renewal in 2026 and another in 2030 drilling and exploration activities have been conducted throughout the mining life of the wodgina property 

the wodgina mine is a pegmatite lithium deposit with spodumene the dominant mineral the lithium mineralization occurs as 10  30 cm long greywhite spodumene crystals within medium grained pegmatites comprising primarily of quartz feldspar spodumene and muscovite typically the spodumene crystals are oriented orthogonal to the pegmatite contacts 

the facilities at wodgina consist of a three stage crushing plant the spodumene concentration plant administrative offices an accommodation camp a power station gas pipeline three mature and reliable water bore fields extension for future tailing storage and a fleet of owned and leased mine production equipment the gas pipeline feeds the site power station to provide the power to the facilities water is obtained from the dedicated water bore fields we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2020 our 60 portion of the gross asset value of the facilities at our wodgina site was approximately 186 million there was no production from the wodgina site during the year ended december 31 2020 as the site remains on care and maintenance until market demand supports bringing it back to production 

other significant lithium processing facilities 

we are currently constructing a highquality spodumene conversion plant in kemerton australia approximately 17 km northeast of bunbury western australia valued at 12 billion with 480 million or 40 to be owned by mrl as part of the acquisition as a result of the acquisition of 60 of the wodgina project from mrl we will own 60 of the kemerton conversion plant with the remaining 40 owned by mrl construction of the plant is expected to be completed in late 2021 followed by a six month commissioning and qualification process when completed the plant will covert spodumene concentrate transferred from talison and the wodgina site when operating to lithium hydroxide 

once construction is complete the kemerton facility will consist of a frontend and backend processing areas to produce lithium hydroxide on two product processing trains the frontend portion of the plant includes the following sections  calcination and acid roasting of lithium spodumene and leachingpulping of the resultant lithium solution the backend portion of the plant will include solution crystallization evaporation and dryingpackaging areas where the finished product lithium hydroxide will prepared for shipment to our customers via truck rail or boat kemerton is expected to have an initial capacity of about 50000 metric tons 25000 metric tons per processing train of lce of lithium hydroxide with an ability to expand to 100000 metric tons lce over time 

the facilities in meishan and xinyu consist of a frontend and backend processing areas to produce lithium hydroxide at each site the frontend portion of the plant includes the following sections  calcination and acid roasting of lithium spodumene and leachingpulping of the resultant lithium solution the backend portion of the plants include solution crystallization evaporation and dryingpackaging areas where the finished product lithium hydroxide is prepared for shipment to our customers via truck rail or boat we consider the condition of all of our plants and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of december 31 2020 the combined gross asset value of our facilities at our meishan and xinyu sites was approximately 120 million during 2020 we produced approximately 35000 metric tons of lce of lithium hydroxide at our meishan and xinyu facilities 



magnolia arkansas 

magnolia is located in the southwest arkansas north of the center of columbia county approximately 50 miles east of texarkana and 135 miles south of little rock our facilities include two separate production plants the south plant and the west plant the south plant is accessible via us route 79 and paved local roads the west plant is accessible by us route 371 and paved local roads the decentralized well sites around the brine fields are accessed via paved arkansas highway 19 98 160 and 344 

in magnolia bromine is recovered from underground brine wells and then processed into a variety of end products at the plant on location albemarle has a total of 25 brine production wells and 35 production brine injection wells that are currently active on the property albemarle’s area of bromine operation is comprised of over 9500 individual leases with local landowners comprising a total area of over 98500 acres the leases have been acquired over time as field development extended across the field each lease continues for a period of 25 years or longer until after a two year period where brine is not injected or produced fromto a well within two miles of lease land areas as long as lease rentals are continuing to be paid 

bromine extraction began in magnolia in 1965 as the first brine supply well was drilled and additional wells were put into production over the next few years in 1987 a predecessor company took over operations of certain brine supply and injection wells which albemarle continues to operate to this day in 2019 albemarle completed and put into production two new brine production supply wells in magnolia 

in magnolia bromine exists as sodium bromide in the formation waters or brine of the jurassic age smackover formation a geological formation in arkansas in the subsurface at 7000 to 8500 feet below sea level the mineralization occurs within the highly saline smackover formation waters or brine where the bromide has an abnormally rich composition the bromine concentration is more than twice as high as that found in normal evaporated sea water the bromine mineralization of the brine is distributed throughout the porous intervals of the upper and middle smackover on the property the strong permeability and porosity of the smackover grainstones provide excellent continuity of the bromine mineralization within the brine 

the facilities at magnolia consist of brine production and injection wells brine ponds two bromine processing plants pipelines between the plants and wells a laboratory storage and warehouses administrative offices as well as a fleet of owned and leased equipment our magnolia facilities are supplied electricity from a local company and we currently have several operating freshwater wells nearby that supply water to the facilities in addition both plants have dedicated rail spurs that provide access to several rail lines to transport product throughout the country we consider the condition of all of our plants facilities and equipment to be suitable and adequate for the businesses we conduct and we maintain them regularly as of 



december 31 2020 the gross asset value of our facilities at our magnolia site was approximately 747 million during 2020 we produced approximately 74000 metric tons of bromine at our magnolia facilities

we are involved in litigation incidental to our business and are a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits including but not limited to those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters product liability and breach of contract some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

as first reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period

outlook 

the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve in particular the market for lithium battery and energy storage particularly that for evs remains strong providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity the other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions such as slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility crude oil price fluctuation a dynamic pricing environment an everchanging landscape in electronics the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders we believe that our businesses remain wellpositioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets 

currently the covid19 pandemic is having an impact on overall global economic conditions while we have not seen a material impact to our operations to date the ultimate impact on our business will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak throughout the world all of our information technology systems are running as designed and all sites are operating at normal capacity while we continue to comply with all government and health agency recommendations and requirements as well as protecting the safety of our employees and communities we believe we have sufficient inventory to continue to produce at current levels however government mandated shutdowns could impact our ability to acquire additional materials and disrupt our customers’ purchases at this time we cannot predict the expected overall financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business but we are planning for various economic scenarios and continue to make efforts to protect the safety of our employees and the health of our business 

lithium we expect results to be flat yearoveryear during 2021 in lithium due mainly to pricing pressure in certain markets and higher unit costs from plant startups at la negra chile and kemerton western australia offset by modest volume growth and increased productivity at our existing plants there is no new capacity coming online during 2021 to drive significant additional sales volume although we expect our new plants in la negra and kemerton to begin producing sales in 2022 in addition we have seen reduced demand in the glass and ceramics markets which has led to reduced sales in the third quarter of 2020 we announced idling actions at certain plants however we have since restarted those facilities ev sales have started to rebound after a marked slowdown during the second quarter of 2020 with full year 2020 showing a healthy increase in total ev sales over the prior year we continue to keep the wodgina spodumene mine idled until demand supports bringing the mine back to production 

on a longerterm basis we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and full battery electric vehicles increases this demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium ion battery costs increasing battery performance continuing significant investments in the battery and ev supply chain by our customers and automotive oem’s favorable global public policy toward emobilityrenewable energy usage and additional stimulus measures taken in europe in light of the covid19 pandemic that we expect to bolster ev demand our outlook is also bolstered by longterm supply agreements with key strategic customers reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner highlighted by our scale access to geographically diverse lowcost resources and longterm track record of reliability of supply and operating execution 

bromine specialties we expect both net sales and profitability to be modestly higher in 2021 as we recover from the lower demand due to shutdowns related to the covid19 pandemic and ongoing cost savings initiatives while we have not experienced a material impact from the covid19 pandemic to date sales in 2020 were adversely impacted and we are likely to see continued adverse impacts into 2021 

on a longerterm basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in 



developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products our longterm drilling outlook is uncertain at this time and will follow a longterm trajectory in line with oil prices we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets the combination of our solid longterm business fundamentals strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through endmarket challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets 

catalysts total catalysts results in 2021 are expected to be flat yearoveryear with pcs improving over lower 2020 levels we expect 2021 refining catalyst volumes to be lower yearoveryear resulting from a recent change in customer order patterns in north america the fcc market is expected to gradually recover from the covid19 pandemic in line with increased travel and depletion of global gasoline inventories however demand may not return to normal levels until late 2022 at the earliest hpc demand tends to be lumpier than fcc demand and is also expected to continue to be negatively impacted as refiners defer spending into 2021 and 2022 

on a longerterm basis we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels new refinery startups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our catalysts business we believe delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world including those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields longerterm we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio with superior technology and production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that catalysts remains wellpositioned for the future in pcs we expect growth on a longerterm basis in our organometallic business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending as previously announced we are pursuing opportunities to divest pcs 

all other the fine chemistry services “fcs” business is reported outside the company’s reportable segments as it does not fit in the company’s core businesses we expect the near future prospects for the fcs business to continue to be positively impacted by the timing of customer orders in a strong pharmaceutical and agriculture contract manufacturing environment as previously announced we are pursuing opportunities to divest our fcs business 

corporate we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions on february 8 2021 we completed an underwritten public offering of 8496733 shares of our common stock par value 001 per share at a price to the public of 15300 per share the company also granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1274509 shares for a period of 30 days which was exercisedthe total gross proceeds from this offering were approximately 15 billion before deducting expenses underwriting discounts and commissions we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering primarily to fund growth capital expenditures such as the construction and expansion of lithium operations in australia chile and silver peak nevada and opportunities in china we also intend to use the net proceeds for debt repayment in the short term and other general corporate purposes 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2020 include an actuarial loss of 523 million 409 million after income taxes as compared to a loss of 293 million 211 million after income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019

property plant and equipment we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash flows and discount rates among other items when acquiring mineral reserves the fair value is estimated using an excess earnings approach which requires management to estimate future cash flows net of capital investments in the specific operation management’s cash flow projections involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected production of the mine over the estimated time period sales prices shipment volumes and expected profit margins the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the preliminary fair value assigned to mineral reserves the 



discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers a performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer the transaction price of a contract or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments if applicable for any variable consideration such as customer rebates noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer although these adjustments are generally not material where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation although these situations do not occur frequently and are generally not built into our contracts any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers which in some cases is based on established market prices sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days however they vary by market factors such as customer size creditworthiness geography and competitive environment 

all of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days costs for shipping and handling activities whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods are accounted for as fulfillment costs 

the company currently utilizes the following practical expedients as permitted by accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  

• all sales and other passthrough taxes are excluded from contract value 

• in utilizing the modified retrospective transition method no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year 

• we will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income unless if at contract inception the expected payment terms from time of delivery or other relevant criterion are more than one year 

• if our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right and 

• we expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costscompensation attributable to individual product salesshipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less 



certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer in management’s judgment control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time upon shipment or delivery and not over the time they are produced therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products 

costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less when the company incurs preproduction or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates which is less than one year we record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows for all reporting units include assumptions about revenue growth rates adjusted ebitda margins discount rate as well as other economic or industryrelated factors for the refining solutions reporting unit the revenue growth rates adjusted ebitda margins and the discount rate were deemed to be significant assumptions significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2020 and did not note any impairment indicators as a result the company concluded there was no impairment as of that date 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names and trademarks for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents and customer lists are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twentyfive years except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our lithium business which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

resource development expenses 

we incur costs in resource exploration evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects exploration costs incurred before the declaration of proven and probable resources are generally expensed as incurred after proven and probable resources are declared exploration evaluation and development costs necessary to bring the property to commercial capacity or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized any costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred 



capitalized resource costs are depleted using the unitsofproduction method our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

• discount rate—the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 

• expected return on plan assets—we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets for these investments these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 

• rate of compensation increase—for salaryrelated plans we project employees’ annual pay increases which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement 

• mortality assumptions—assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations 

actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a monthly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2020 we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2020 the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2020 measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2020 the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans decreased to 250 and 086 respectively from 356 and 133 respectively at december 31 2019 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2020 measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 249 and 353 respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2020 and 2019 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 688 and the weightedaverage expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 407 and 551 respectively effective january 1 2021 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 688 and 412 respectively 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2020 and 2019 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 382 and 372 respectively for our foreign pension plans 



in october 2019 the soa published the pri2012 mortality tables and an updated improvement scale mp2019 the pri2012 mortality tables are an update to the rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality while the updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data 2017 we revised both the base mortality tables and mortality improvement assumption by incorporating both the pri2012 mortality tables and mp2019 mortality improvement scale for purpose of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2019 in october 2020 the soa published an updated improvement scale mp2020 which was used for the purpose of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2020 

at december 31 2020 the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6835 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2020 788 million or approximately 12 are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 



we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2017 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2011 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process we have audits ongoing for the years 2011 through 2019 related to germany italy belgium and chile some of which are for entities that have since been divested 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 05 million as a result of closure of tax statutes as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in 2016 we agreed to indemnify certain income and nonincome tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions associated with the entities sold the associated liability is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities see note 16 “other noncurrent liabilities” and note 21 “income taxes” for further details 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested we will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs funding working capital and service of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable payables and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 7467 million at december 31 2020 as compared to 6131 million at december 31 2019 cash provided by operating activities was 7989 million 7194 million and 5462 million during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 versus 2019 was primarily due to lower working capital outflow including inventory reductions and the timing of receivable collections as well as the previously announced companywide cost savings initiative and increased dividends from unconsolidated investments which more than offset lower revenues in each of our reportable segments the working capital outflow in 2020 also included the payment of 615 million related to stamp duties in australia levied on the assets purchased as part of the acquisition of the wodgina project completed in 2019 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 versus 2018 was primarily due to lower working capital outflow including a reduction in inventory buildup in lithium and catalysts in addition we received increased dividends from unconsolidated investments and recorded higher cash earnings particularly in bromine specialties this was partially offset by timing on payables and higher cash taxes paid 

during 2020 cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings of 200 million from one of our credit facilities funded 8505 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1618 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 164 million in addition during 2020 we received 110 



million in proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in the socc joint venture during and paid 226 million of agreed upon purchase price adjustments for the wodgina project acquisition during 2019 cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings of 160 billion funded the wodgina project acquisition discussed below 8518 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1522 million the repayment of 1752 million of senior notes and pension and postretirement contributions of 165 million during 2018 cash on hand cash provided by operations and 4136 million of net proceeds from divestitures funded 1147 million of commercial paper repayments net of borrowings 5000 million of accelerated share repurchase programs 7000 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development dividends to shareholders of 1446 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 152 million in addition during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 637 million 2249 million and 400 million respectively which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 321 million 832 million and 148 million respectively 

on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in the wodgina project for a total purchase price of13 billion the purchase price is comprised of 820 million in cash and the transfer of 40 interest in certain lithium hydroxide conversion assets being built by albemarle in kemerton western australia valued at approximately 480 million in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we paid 226 million of agreed upon purchase price adjustments the cash consideration was funded by the unsecured credit facility entered into on august 14 2019 

in november 2019 we issued notes totaling 5000 million and €10 billion the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay the 10 billion balance of the the unsecured credit facility entered into on august 14 2019 a large portion of approximately 370 million of commercial paper notes the remaining balance of 1752 million of the senior notes issued on december 10 2010 “2010 senior notes” and for general corporate purposes during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 48 million in interest and financing expenses representing the tender premiums fees unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2010 senior notes 

on april 3 2018 we completed the polyolefin catalysts divestiture to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million and recorded a gain of 2104 million before income taxes in 2018 related to the sale of this business the transaction included albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale did not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business the polyolefin catalysts divestiture reflects our commitment to investing in the future growth of our high priority businesses and returning capital to our shareholders 

capital expenditures were 8505 million 8518 million and 7000 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development we expect our capital expenditures to be between 850 million and 950 million in 2021 primarily for lithium growth and capacity increases primarily in australia chile and silver peak nevada as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments we currently expect the construction of the kemerton australia and la negra chile plants to be completed by the end of 2021 with sales volume from these plants beginning in 2022 

during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we incurred 173 million 207 million and 194 million of costs related to the acquisition integration and potential divestitures for various significant projects including the acquisition of the wodgina project in 2019 which primarily consisted of professional services and advisory fees 

the company is permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15000000 shares under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors under this share repurchase program the company repurchased approximately 53 million shares of our common stock during 2018 respectively which reduced the company’s weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share all of the shares repurchased in 2018 were repurchased pursuant to the terms of accelerated share repurchase agreements with major financial institutions there were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2020 or 2019 at december 31 2020 there were 7396263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the company’s authorized share repurchase program 

net current assets decreased to approximately 4043 million at december 31 2020 from 8161 million at december 31 2019 the decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of 480 million of senior notes due to mature in december 2021 from longterm debt to current portion of longterm debt this is partially offset by the increase in cash and cash equivalents additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company and do 



not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 our cash and cash equivalents included 4928 million and 5656 million respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we repatriated approximately 18 million 3519 million and 6218 million of cash respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have the following notes outstanding 



a denotes senior notes 

b borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 3month libor plus 105 basis points the floating interest rate for the current interest period is 1271 with the interest rate reset on each interest payment date

our euro notes issued in 2019 are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all our other unsecured senior obligations as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each of these notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal thereof and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis using the bond rate as defined in 



the indentures governing these notes plus between 25 and 35 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to but excluding the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures these notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness exceeding 100 million caused by a nonpayment default

borrowings under the credit agreements are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including the absence of defaults the company is subject to one financial covenant as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants the financial covenant initially required that the company’s consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio as such terms are defined in the credit agreements to be less than or equal to 3501 subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements relating to a consummation of an acquisition where the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of 500 million as a result of the uncertainty of the overall financial impact of the covid19 pandemic the company amended the credit agreements on may 11 2020 to modify its financial covenant based on the company’s current expectations the amendment effects changes to certain provisions of the credit agreements including a conversion of the consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio to a consolidated net funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio b carvingout third party sales of accounts receivables from the securitization transaction definition c setting the consolidated net funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio to 4001 for the fiscal quarter ending june 30 2020 4501 for the fiscal quarters through september 30 2021 4001 for the fiscal quarter ending december 31 2021 and 3501 for fiscal quarters thereafter and d reducing the priority debt basket to 24 of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the credit agreements through and including december 31 2021 as part of this amendment the company has agreed to pay a 10 basis point fee on the consenting lenders commitments under the credit agreements the credit agreements also contain customary default provisions including defaults for nonpayment breach of representations and warranties insolvency nonperformance of covenants and crossdefaults to other material indebtedness the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreements could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the credit facility being terminated if conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic worsen and the company’s earnings and cash flow from operations do not start to recover as contemplated in the companys current plans the company may not be able to maintain compliance with its amended financial covenant and it will require the company to seek additional amendments to the credit agreements if the company is not able to obtain such necessary additional amendments that would lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the company to repay its outstanding debt in that situation the company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay the lenders certain representations warranties and covenants under the 2018 credit agreement were conformed to those under the 2019 credit facility following an amendment entered into on august 14 2019 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper 



notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company the credit agreements are available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 10 billion current maximum amount available under the credit agreements the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2020 we had 3250 million of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 051 and a weightedaverage maturity of 16 days the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2020 and 2019 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 277 billion at december 31 2020 compared to 286 billion at december 31 2019 in addition at december 31 2020 we had the ability to borrow 118 billion under our commercial paper program and the credit agreements and 1959 million under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our credit agreements we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the credit agreements as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2020 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 931 million at december 31 2020 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make acquisitions make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future our main focus during the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic is to continue to maintain financial flexibility by continuing our cost savings initiative while still protecting our employees and customers committing to shareholder returns and maintaining an investment grade rating over the next three years in terms of uses of cash we will continue to invest in growth of the businesses and return value to shareholders additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity as previously announced we are pursuing opportunities to divest our pcs and fine chemistry services businesses 

on february 8 2021 we completed an underwritten public offering of 8496773 shares of our common stock par value 001 per share at a price to the public of 15300 per share the company also granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1274509 shares for a period of 30 days which was exercised the total gross proceeds from this offering were approximately 15 billion before deducting expenses underwriting discounts and commissions we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering primarily to fund growth capital expenditures such as the construction and expansion of lithium operations in australia chile and silver peak nevada and opportunities in china we also intend to use the net proceeds for debt repayment in the short term and other general corporate purposes 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before december 2021 we believe we have and will be able to maintain a solid liquidity position our annual maturities of longterm debt as of december 31 2020 are as follows in millions 2021—8047 2022—2000 2023—2239 2024—4250 2025—6108 thereafter—13280 obligations in 2021 include the 1875 senior notes of €3930 million and our outstanding commercial paper notes of 3250 million with a weighted average maturity of 16 days in addition we expect to make interest payments on those longterm debt obligations as follows in millions 2021—779 2022—689 2023—647 2024—624 2025—457 thereafter—4319 for variablerate debt obligations projected interest payments are calculated using the december 31 2020 weighted average interest rate of approximately 087 

in addition we expect our capital expenditures to be between 850 million and 950 million in 2021 primarily for lithium growth and capacity increases in australia chile and silver peak nevada as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments we currently expect the construction of the kemerton australia and la negra chile plants to be completed by the end of 2021 with sales volume from these plants beginning in 2022 as of december 31 2020 we have 



also committed to approximately 1009 million of payments to thirdparty vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes with approximately 685 million to be paid in 2021 in order to secure materials sometimes for long durations these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe 

see note 18 “leases” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for our annual expected payments under our operating lease obligations at december 31 2020 

in 2021 we expect to pay 284 million of the 3014 million balance remaining from the transition tax on foreign earnings as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” signed into law in december 2017 the onetime transition tax imposed by the tcja is based on our total post1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from us income taxes and is payable over an eightyear period with the final payment made in 2026 

contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan are expected to approximate 27 million in 2021 we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 133 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2020 

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 147 million and 212 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 241 million and 261 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our liquidity to date however we cannot predict the overall impact in terms of cash flow generation as that will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak as a result we are planning for various economic scenarios and actively monitoring our balance sheet to maintain the financial flexibility needed 

although we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions as sources of financing an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments to us decline funding under our existing but uncommitted lines of credit with them not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing to us while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic or global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature if the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits 

as first reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and the dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 7467 million as of december 31 2020 of which 4928 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money 



market investments with no limitations on access the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental 



matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 449 million 480 million and 429 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2020 totaled approximately 458 million an increase of 32 million from 426 million at december 31 2019 see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 404 million 444 million and 473 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen chinese renminbi australian dollar and chilean peso in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged in the fourth quarter of 2019 we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of nonfunctional currency purchases during the construction of the kemerton plant in australia this contract has been designated as an effective hedging instrument and beginning the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of this contract to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss all other gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as an effective hedging instrument are recognized in other expenses net and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2020 our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 6865 million and with a fair value representing a net asset position of 88 million fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming 



an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2020 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately 81 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase of approximately 167 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2020 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss any subsequent partial repayments of this debt did not impair the designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 7566 million and 3940 million outstanding at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively these borrowings represented 21 and 13 of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 087 and 246 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 76 million as of december 31 2020 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

we obtain lithium through solar evaporation of our ponds at the salar de atacama in chile and in silver peak nevada after we obtain the lithium brine from the salar de atacama we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at a plant in nearby la negra chile the lithium brine from our silver peak site is processed into lithium carbonate at our plant in silver peak subsequently in other locations in the united states “us” germany france and taiwan we further process the materials into various derivatives depending on the markets we serve in addition we own undeveloped land with access to a lithium resource in antofalla within the catamarca province of argentina if necessary we can also obtain lithium from other sources 

our mineral rights with respect to the salar de atacama in chile consist exclusively of our right to access lithium brine covering an area of approximately 16700 hectares pursuant to a longterm contract with the chilean government originally entered into in january 1975 by one of our predecessors and subsequently amended and restated the amended agreement provides us with sufficient lithium to produce over 80000 metric tons annually of technical and batterygrade lithium salts over the next 24 years at our expanding batterygrade manufacturing facilities in la negra chile in addition the amended agreement provides for commission payments to the chilean government based on sales pricemetric ton our support of research and development in chile in lithium applications and solar energy and our support of local communities in northern chile 

our mineral rights in silver peak nevada consist of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to our permitted and certified senior water rights a settlement agreement with the us government originally entered into in june 1991 and our patented and unpatented land claims pursuant to the 1991 agreement our water rights and our land claims we have rights to all lithium that we can remove economically from the clayton valley basin in nevada we have been operating at the silver peak site since 1966 our silver peak site covers a surface of over 13500 acres 10826 acres of which we own through a subsidiary the remaining acres are owned by the us government from whom we lease the land pursuant to unpatented land claims that are renewed annually based on our 2019 production levels we believe that the amount of lithium brine we can economically obtain from our silver peak nevada site pursuant to our rights could support the current levels of lithium carbonate production for approximately 20 years assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied our annual lithium carbonate production capacity is estimated to be at least 6000 metric tons at our silver peak facility however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium carbonate at either silver peak or la negra will be realized 

we also obtain lithium through hard rock mining via our 49 interest in windfield holdings pty ltd which directly owns 100 of the equity of talison lithium pty ltd a company incorporated in australia “talison” talison through its whollyowned subsidiaries owns and operates a lithium mine in greenbushes western australia and mines lithium ore which is then milled and processed to separate lithium concentrate from the rest of the ore talison currently sells the lithium concentrate only to its shareholders talison has a leading position in two categories of lithium concentrates i technicalgrade lithium concentrates which have low iron content for use in the manufacture of glass ceramics and heatproof cookware and ii a highyielding chemicalgrade lithium concentrate used to produce lithium chemicals which form the basis for the manufacture of lithiumion batteries for laptop computers mobile phones electric bicycles and electric vehicles albemarle’s share of the chemicalgrade lithium concentrate is processed into batterygrade lithium hydroxide at our jiangxi and sichuan china facilities and lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide at our tolling partners in china following the completion of a chemicalgrade concentrate expansion in 2019 talison’s annual lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity is approximately 160000 metric tons along with annual production capacity for 10000 metric tons of technicalgrade lithium concentrate of which albemarle’s production share is 50 percent however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium concentrate at talison will be realized 

on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in mineral resources limited’s “mrl” wodgina hard rock lithium mine project “wodgina project” in western australia and formed an unincorporated joint venture with mrl named marbl lithium joint venture for the exploration development mining processing and production of lithium and other minerals other than iron ore and tantalum from the wodgina project and for the operation of the kemerton lithium hydroxide conversion assets based on current market conditions marbl lithium joint venture will idle production of spodumene until market demand supports bringing the mine back into production the kemerton plant is currently scheduled to be commissioned in stages during the first half of 2021 with an initial lithium hydroxide conversion capacity of 50000 metric tons

competition 

our bromine business serves markets in the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace our most significant competitors are lanxess ag and israel chemicals ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the bromine we use is sourced from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our bromine production operations in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we estimate that at current production levels we will be able to produce bromine in arkansas for decades in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we source bromine from the dead sea which is believed to have indefinite quantities of brine 

catalysts segment 

our three main product lines in this segment are i clean fuels technologies “cft” which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” together with isomerization and akylation catalysts ii fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” catalysts and additives and iii performance catalyst solutions “pcs” which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives 

we offer a wide range of hpc products which are applied throughout the oil refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes we continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market 

we provide our customers with customized fcc catalyst systems fcc catalysts assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs 

within our pcs product line we manufacture organometallic cocatalysts eg aluminum magnesium and zinc alkyls used in the manufacture of alphaolefins ie hexene octene decene polyolefins polyethylene and polypropylene and electronics our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes epoxies and other engineered resins 

there were more than 600 refineries worldwide in 2019 over the longterm we expect to see some smaller refineries shutting down and being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries with growth concentrated in the middle east and asia oil refining has again increased moderately compared to the previous year we estimate that there are currently approximately 600 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3000 hpc units being operated globally or a capacity of approximately 46 million barrels per day each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to four years 



competition 

our catalysts segment serves the global market including the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive competition in these markets is driven by a variety factors product performance and quality price and contract terms product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace in addition through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

our major competitors in the cft catalysts market include shell catalysts  technologies advanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co basf corporation and china petrochemical corporation sinopec in the pcs market our major competitors include nouryon lanxess ag and lonza 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin aluminum ethylene alphaolefins isobutylene toluene and rare earths and metals such as lanthanum molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales and technical personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers globally we also utilize commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas when necessary or required by law 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2019  we owned approximately 2100 active patents and approximately 550 pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act “osha” we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2019 with an osha occupational injury and illness incident rate of 035 for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 058 in 2018  

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments 



additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

the toxic substances control act “tsca” as amended in june 2016 requires chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation this regulation and other pending initiatives at the us state level as well as initiatives in canada asia and other regions will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further details 



climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities we provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

during recent years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries in addition we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses which do not fit our high priority business growth profile following is a summary of our significant acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures over the last three years 

on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in mrl’s wodgina project in western australia and formed an unincorporated joint venture with mrl for the exploration development mining processing and production of lithium and other minerals other than iron ore and tantalum from the wodgina project and for the operation of the kemerton assets for a total purchase price of approximately 13 billion  subject to certain adjustments capped at 225 million  as part of this acquisition marbl lithium operations pty ltd the “manager” an incorporated joint venture was formed to manage the wodgina project 

on april 3 2018 we completed the sale of the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of the pcs business “polyolefin catalysts divestiture” to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million  the transaction included albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale did not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business 

these transactions reflect our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses maintaining leverage flexibility and returning capital to our shareholders 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 6000 employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures of whom 2800  or 47  are employed in the us and latin america 1500  or 25  are employed in europe 1200  or 20  are employed in asia and 500  or 8  are employed in the middle east or other areas approximately 22 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils we believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees and with those unions and works councils

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us with approximately 76 of our sales to foreign countries we operate andor sell our products to customers in approximately 75 countries we currently have many production facilities research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the us as detailed in item 2 properties accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 in addition certain of our operations and we have ongoing capital projects in regions of the world such as the middle east and south america that are of high risk due to significant civil political and security instability unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 



furthermore we are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery and antitrust prohibitions of the us and other countries as well as export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will in part depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities which could adversely impact us furthermore other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to do so or may be delayed in doing so in addition raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 

competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

we compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins and profitability our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

in addition albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims whether with or without merit against our company or its products imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us or are otherwise disparaging of our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing end markets as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all as may be required to replace or enhance existing products and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position 



in addition our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

despite our efforts we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace furthermore ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

the development of nonlithium battery technologies could adversely affect us 

the development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues current and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input alternative materials and technologies are being researched with the goal of making batteries lighter more efficient faster charging and less expensive and some of these could be less reliant on lithium compounds we cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and on what time horizon commercialized battery technologies that use less lithium could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues 

adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a global regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national regional and global economies including economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 

downturns in our customers’ industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries which are cyclical in nature or which are subject to secular market downturns historically cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to four years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 



regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union “eu” continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under reach which imposes obligations on eu manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the eu to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain see “regulation” in item 1 business our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the eu requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

the toxic substances control act “tsca” as amended in june 2016 requires chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation this regulation and other pending initiatives at the us state level as well as initiatives in canada asia and other regions could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers 



our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation as well as natural resource extraction including explosions fires severe weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of disruptions shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous us and nonus national federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties we currently use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities including for example current and prior property owners or operators as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify 

further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing registrationapproval requirements transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years we expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 



at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar foreign anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management if we are found to be liable for violations of the fcpa or other applicable anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our joint ventures we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as previously reported in 2018 and 2019 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the us department of justice “doj” the sec and dutch public prosecutor “dpp” and are cooperating with the doj the sec and the dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses 

we are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business 

we are subject to government regulation in nonus jurisdictions in which we conduct our business the requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses or require changes in business practice in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries or their enforcement may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 



we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise in addition our trade secrets and knowhow may be improperly obtained by other means such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft 

our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability 

our lithium reserves will without more decline as we continue to extract these raw materials accordingly our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably once a site with potential resources is discovered it may take several years of development until production is possible during which time the economic viability of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

we utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project the actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as but not limited to changes in volumes grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made adverse geotechnical conditions availability supply and cost of water and power fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development changes in royalty agreements laws andor regulations around royalties and other taxes and weather or severe climate impacts 

for our existing operations we utilize geological and metallurgical assumptions financial projections and price estimates these estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material revisions to environmental obligations changes in legislation andor social political or economic environment and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable reserves including many factors beyond our control that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges 

there is risk to the growth of lithium markets 

our lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium power and the growth in demand for plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles to the extent that such development adoption and growth do not occur in the volume andor manner that we contemplate the longterm growth in the markets for 



lithium products may be adversely affected which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

demand and market prices for lithium will greatly affect the value of our investment in our lithium resources and our ability to develop it successfully 

our ability to successfully develop our lithium resources including recently acquired 60 interest in mrl’s wodgina project and generate a return on investment will be affected by changes in the demand for and market price of lithiumbased end products such as lithium hydroxide the market price of these products can fluctuate and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control primarily world supply and demand such external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns various political developments and macroeconomic circumstances in addition the price of lithium products is impacted by their purity and performance we may not be able to effectively mitigate against such fluctuations 

following the wodgina acquisition we announced that based on current market conditions the wodgina mine would idle production of spodumene until market demand supports bringing the mine back into production there can be no assurance that the market demand for lithium will improve or that the wodgina mine will be put back into production in the future or at all delays in putting the mine into production as well as continued fluctuations in demand for and pricing of lithium and related products may affect the value of our investment in the wodgina project and our value as a whole 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches information technology system failures or network disruptions 

attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

in addition risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and around the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program “cfats program” which is administered by the department of homeland security “dhs” identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 “cfats act” was enacted the cfats act reauthorized the cfats program for four years on january 18 2019 the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program 



extension act was enacted to extend the cfats program for another 15 months dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of the uss chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and the markets for our products in particular the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our results of operations 

the occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes floods or earthquakes pandemics such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid19 or other unanticipated catastrophes at any of the locations in which we or our key partners suppliers and customers do business could cause interruptions in our operations historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes and our operations in asia could be subject to weather events such as typhoons a global or regional pandemic or similar outbreak in a region of our our customers or our suppliers could disrupt business if similar or other weather events natural disasters or other catastrophe events occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and other insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and coverage limits we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations in addition we have operations in the eu brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented or may implement measures to achieve objectives under the 2015 paris climate agreement an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities and fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be 



able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions and regulatory changes relating to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our business 

following a referendum in 2016 voters in the united kingdom “uk” approved that country’s exit from the eu a process often referred to as “brexit” the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 and is now in a transition period through december 31 2020 the future effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent and the uncertainty around the terms upon which the uk will leave the eu it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications brexit would have and how such withdrawal would affect our company we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside the us including 15 from eu countries the consequences of brexit together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of brexit including the possibility of a socalled “hard brexit” where no formal agreement is made between the eu and uk prior to the uk’s exit from the eu could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets including volatility in foreign currencies and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations operating results and financial condition all of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the eu 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team in light of the specialized and technical nature of our business our performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

on february 5 2020 the company announced that chairman and chief executive officer luke kissam had advised the board of directors that he will retire from his roles as an officer and director of albemarle effective june 2020 for health reasons the board of directors will be conducting a comprehensive search process which will include internal and external candidates 

some of our employees are unionized represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 6000 employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures approximately 22 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint 



venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our financial condition 

our required capital expenditures can be complex may experience delays or other difficulties and the costs may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment facilities and properties and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment facilities and properties execution of these capital expenditures can be complex and commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products in addition our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including crossdefaults to other debt facilities see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 



we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the eu euro japanese yen chinese renminbi australian dollar and chilean peso exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 32 of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to rockwood’s periods prior to its acquisition by us these indemnity obligations will continue generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity our earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the applicable tax law due to 



significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings which may be material in the future the outcome of proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables 

legal and regulatory proceedings whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other resources inhibit our ability to sell our products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and otherwise negatively affect our business 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us uk germany belgium and japan we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 108 million of required cash contributions during 2020 for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2020 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs and support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint 



ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

 we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants in addition the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences and risks for us including 

 if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition

legal proceedings

we are involved in litigation incidental to our business and are a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits including but not limited to those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters product liability and breach of contract some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

as previously reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” 

overview 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that are designed to meet our customers’ needs across a diverse range of end markets the end markets we serve include energy storage petroleum refining consumer electronics construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection and custom chemistry services we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible lowcost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace to contribute to our sustainable revenue for example our lithium business contributes to the growth of clean miles driven with electric miles and more efficient use of renewable energy through grid storage bromine specialties enables the prevention of fires starting in electronic equipment greater fuel efficiency from rubber tires and the reduction of emissions from coal fired power plants and the catalysts business creates efficiency of natural resources through more usable products from a single barrel of oil enables safer greener production of alkylates used to produce more environmentallyfriendly fuels and reduced emissions through cleaner transportation fuels we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements among other factors position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment 

2019 highlights 







outlook 

the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve in particular the market for lithium battery and energy storage continues to accelerate providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity the other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions such as slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility crude oil price fluctuation a dynamic pricing environment an everchanging landscape in electronics the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders we believe that our businesses remain wellpositioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets 

lithium we expect results to decline yearoveryear during 2020 in lithium due mainly to pricing pressure in certain markets partially offset by productivity enhancements across our business in addition there is no new capacity coming online during 2020 to drive significant additional volume while we completed the acquisition of 60 interest in the wodgina project we have made the decision to idle production of spodumene until demand supports bringing the mine back into production 

on a longerterm basis we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and full battery electric vehicles increases this demand for lithium is supported by a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium ion battery costs increasing battery performance and favorable global public policy toward emobilityrenewable energy usage our outlook is also bolstered by longterm supply agreements with key strategic customers reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner highlighted by our scale access to geographically diverse lowcost resources and longterm track record of reliability of supply and operating execution 

bromine specialties we expect to see modest growth in net sales in 2020 driven by continued strong demand in flame retardants drilling completion fluids and other derivatives we expect profitability to be flat to slightly down due to lower overall average selling prices as global bromine supply and demand comes into balance in 2020 



on a longerterm basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling we would expect this business to follow a longterm growth trajectory once oil prices recover from prevailing levels as we expect that deepwater drilling will continue to increase around the world we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets the combination of our solid longterm business fundamentals strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through endmarket challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets 

catalysts we expect to see modest sales growth in net sales and flat to modest growth in profitability in 2020 driven by fcc growth partially offset by lower hpc results we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels new refinery startups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our catalysts business we believe delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world including those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields longerterm we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio with superior technology and production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that catalysts remains wellpositioned for the future in pcs we expect growth on a longerterm basis in our organometallic business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending in 2019 we announced that we have begun to pursue opportunities to divest pcs with the expectation that a divestiture will be completed in 2020 

all other the fine chemistry services business is reported outside the company’s reportable segments as it does not fit in the company’s core businesses we expect the near future prospects for the fine chemistry services business to be impacted by a challenging agriculture industry environment and the timing of customer orders in pharmaceuticals in addition in 2019 we announced that we have begun to pursue opportunities to divest our fine chemistry services business with the expectation that a divestiture will be completed in 2020 

corporate we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate for 2020 to be between 185 and 195 however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us including the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” and other tax jurisdictions 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2019 include an actuarial loss of 293 million  211 million after income taxes as compared to a loss of 140 million  106 million after income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018

segment information overview we have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions our reportable business segments consist of 1 lithium 2 bromine specialties and 3 catalysts 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables the “all other” category includes only the fine chemistry services business that does not fit into any of our core businesses 

the corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporaterelated items not allocated to the operating segments pension and opeb service cost which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments all other and corporate whereas the remaining components of pension and opeb benefits cost or credit “nonoperating pension and opeb items” are included in corporate segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs 

the company’s chief operating decision maker uses adjusted ebitda as defined below to assess the ongoing performance of the company’s business segments and to allocate resources the company defines adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain nonrecurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis these nonrecurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration related costs gains or losses on sales of businesses restructuring charges facility divestiture charges nonoperating pension and opeb items and other significant nonrecurring items in addition management uses adjusted ebitda for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performancebased compensation for management and other employees the company has reported adjusted ebitda because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables periodtoperiod comparability of financial performance adjusted ebitda is a financial 



measure that is not required by or presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to albemarle corporation the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with us gaap or any other financial measure reported in accordance with us gaap

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

property plant and equipment we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our mineral rights and reserves which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash flows and discount rates among other items when acquiring mineral reserves the fair value is estimated using an excess earnings approach which requires management to estimate future cash flows net of capital investments in the specific operation management’s cash flow projections involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected production of the mine over the estimated time period sales prices shipment volumes and expected profit margins 



the present value of the projected net cash flows represents the preliminary fair value assigned to mineral reserves the discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers a performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer the transaction price of a contract or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments if applicable for any variable consideration such as customer rebates noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer although these adjustments are generally not material where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation although these situations do not occur frequently and are generally not built into our contracts any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers which in some cases is based on established market prices sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days however they vary by market factors such as customer size creditworthiness geography and competitive environment 

all of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days costs for shipping and handling activities whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods are accounted for as fulfillment costs 

the company currently utilizes the following practical expedients as permitted by accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  





certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer in management’s judgment control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time upon shipment or delivery and not over the time they are produced therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products 

costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less when the company incurs preproduction or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates which is less than one year we record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions about sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions income taxes working capital and other economic or marketrelated factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2019 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date in addition no material indications of impairment in any of our reporting units were indicated by the sensitivity analysis 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names and trademarks for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents and customer lists are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twentyfive years except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our lithium business which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

resource development expenses 

we incur costs in resource exploration evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects exploration costs incurred before obtaining legal rights to explore an area are generally expensed as incurred after obtaining legal rights exploration costs are expensed in areas where we have uncertainty about obtaining proven resources in areas where we have substantial knowledge about the area and consider it probable to obtain commercially viable proven resources exploration and evaluation costs are capitalized 



if technical feasibility studies have been obtained resource evaluation expenses are capitalized when the study demonstrates proven or probable resources for which future economic returns are expected while costs for projects that are not considered viable are expensed development costs that are necessary to bring the property to commercial production or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred 

capitalized resource costs are depleted using the unitsofproduction method our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a monthly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2019  we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2019  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2019 measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2019  the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans decreased to 356 and 133  respectively from 459 and 215  respectively at december 31 2018 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2019 measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 353 and 455  respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2019 and 2018  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 689  and the weightedaverage expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 551 and 552  respectively effective january 1 2020  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 688 and 407  respectively 



in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2019 and 2018  the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 372 and 363  respectively for our foreign pension plans 

in october 2018 the the society of actuaries “soa” published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2018 the updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data 2016 we utilized the same base mortality soa rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the mp2018 mortality improvement scale for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2018 in october 2019 the soa published the pri2012 mortality tables and an updated improvement scale mp2019 the pri2012 mortality tables are an update to the rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality while the updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data 2017 we revised both the base mortality tables and mortality improvement assumption by incorporating both the pri2012 mortality tables and mp2019 mortality improvement scale for purpose of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2019 

at december 31 2019  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6381 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2019  738 million  or approximately 12  are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 



we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2011 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2011 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process we have audits ongoing for the years 2011 through 2018 related to germany italy india belgium and chile some of which are for entities that have since been divested 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 96 million as a result of closure of tax statutes as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in 2016 we agreed to indemnify certain income and nonincome tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions associated with the entities sold the associated liability is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities see note 16 “other noncurrent liabilities” and note 21 “income taxes” for further details 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested we will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law in the us the tcja contains several key tax provisions including among other things the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the requirement of companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings such as global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” a company can elect an accounting policy to account for gilti as a period charge in the future period the tax arises or as part of deferred taxes related to the investment or subsidiary the company has elected to account for gilti as a period cost 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs funding working capital and service of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 6131 million at december 31 2019 as compared to 5553 million at december 31 2018  cash provided by operating activities was 7194 million  5462 million and 3040 million during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 versus 2018 was primarily due to lower working capital outflow including a reduction in inventory buildup in lithium and catalysts in addition we received increased dividends from unconsolidated investments and recorded higher cash earnings particularly in bromine specialties this was partially offset by timing on payables and higher cash taxes paid the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 versus 2017 was primarily due to higher income tax payments in 2017 including approximately 257 million of income taxes from the gain on sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in addition 2018 benefited from increased earnings in each of our reportable segments increased dividends received from unconsolidated investments and lower interest payments this was partially offset by increased receivables from higher net sales during 2018 and the buildup of inventory in our lithium and catalysts segments due to higher forecasted sales 

during 2019  cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings of 160 billion funded 8518 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1522 million  the repayment of 1752 million of senior notes and pension and postretirement contributions of 165 million  during 2018 cash on hand cash provided by operations and 4136 million of net proceeds from divestitures funded 1147 million of commercial paper repayments net of borrowings 5000 million of accelerated share repurchase programs 7000 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development dividends to shareholders of 1446 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 152 million during 2017 cash on hand cash provided by operations and net borrowings of 1388 million funded 7782 million of debt repayments 3177 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment a 2500 million accelerated share repurchase program dividends to shareholders of 1406 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 133 million in addition during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 2249 million 400 million and 1025 million respectively which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 832 million  148 million and 368 million respectively 

on october 31 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 60 interest in the wodgina project for a total purchase price of 13 billion  the purchase price is comprised of 820 million in cash subject to certain adjustments capped at 225 million  and the transfer of 40 interest in certain lithium hydroxide conversion assets being built by albemarle in kemerton western australia valued at approximately 480 million  the cash consideration was funded by the unsecured credit facility entered into on august 14 2019 

in november 2019 we issued notes totaling 5000 million and €10 billion the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay the 10 billion balance of the the unsecured credit facility entered into on august 14 2019 a large portion of approximately 370 million of commercial paper notes the remaining balance of 1752 million of the senior notes issued on december 10 2010 “2010 senior notes” and for general corporate purposes during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 48 million in interest and financing expenses representing the tender premiums fees unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of the 2010 senior notes 

on april 3 2018 we completed the polyolefin catalysts divestiture to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million and recorded a gain of 2104 million before income taxes in 2018 related to the sale of this business the transaction included albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale did not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business the polyolefin catalysts divestiture reflects our commitment to investing in the future growth of our high priority businesses and returning capital to our shareholders 

in the first quarter of 2017 using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business we repaid the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million of the 450 senior notes as well as related tender premiums of 452 million as a result interest and financing expenses on the consolidated statements of income includes a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 528 million for the year ended december 31 2017 representing the tender premiums fees unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the redemption of these senior notes 

capital expenditures were 8518 million  7000 million and 3177 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development the increase in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by expansion in our lithium business we expect our capital expenditures to be between 10 billion and 11 billion in 2020 for lithium growth and capacity increases as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments of the total capital expenditures our projects related to the continuity of operations is expected to remain in the range of 57 of net sales similar to prior years 



during 2019 we incurred 207 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects including the acquisition of the wodgina project primarily consisting of professional services and advisory fees during 2018 we incurred 194 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects during 2017 we incurred 339 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects including the jiangli new materials acquisition which contains nonroutine compensation related costs negotiated specifically as a result of this acquisition that are outside of the company’s ordinary course compensation arrangements 

the company is permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15000000 shares under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors under this share repurchase program the company repurchased approximately 53 million shares and 23 million shares of our common stock during 2018 and 2017 respectively which reduced the company’s weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share all of the shares repurchased in 2018 and 2017 were repurchased pursuant to the terms of accelerated share repurchase agreements with major financial institutions there were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2019 at december 31 2019 there were 7396263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the company’s authorized share repurchase program 

net current assets decreased to approximately 8161 million at december 31 2019 from 8152 million at december 31 2018  with the decrease being largely due to the 40 interest in our kemerton assets being constructed to be transferred to mrl in the next twelve months which is recorded in accrued expenses this is partially offset by the increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of commercial paper notes resulting from the issuance of approximately 16 billion of new notes in november 2019 additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  our cash and cash equivalents included 5656 million and 5258 million  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  we repatriated approximately 3519 million  6218 million and 205 million of cash respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have the following notes outstanding 







 our senior notes and the floating rate note are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding these notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each of these notes outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before its maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of these notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing these notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures these notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default

our revolving unsecured credit agreement dated as of june 21 2018 as amended on august 14 2019 the “2018 credit agreement” currently provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion and matures on august 9 2024 borrowings under the 2018 credit agreement bear interest at variable rates based on an average libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0910 to 1500 depending on the company’s credit rating from standard  poor’s rating services llc “sp” moody’s investors services inc “moody’s” and fitch ratings inc “fitch” the applicable margin on the facility was 1125 as of december 31 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2018 credit agreement as of december 31 2019  

on august 14 2019 the company entered into a 12 billion unsecured credit facility the “2019 credit facility” with several banks and other financial institutions the lenders’ commitment to provide loans under the 2019 credit facility terminates on august 11 2020 with each such loan maturing one year after the funding of such loan the company can request that the maturity date of loans be extended for an additional period of up to four additional years but any such extension is subject to the approval of the lenders borrowings under the 2019 credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on an average libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0875 to 1625 depending on the company’s credit rating from sp moody’s and fitch the applicable margin on the credit facility was 1125 as of december 31 2019  in october 2019 we borrowed 10 billion under this credit facility to fund the cash portion of the october 31 2019 acquisition of a 60 interest in mrl’s wodgina project and for general corporate purposes and such amount was repaid in full in november 2019 using a portion of the proceeds received from the notes issued in 2019 see above for further details following the repayment of the amounts borrowed the company had 200 million remaining to borrow under this credit facility there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2019 credit facility as of december 31 2019  

borrowings under the 2019 credit facility and 2018 credit agreement together “the credit agreements” are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including the absence of defaults the company is subject to one financial covenant as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants the financial covenant requires that the company’s consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio as such terms are defined in the credit agreements to be less than or equal to 350100 subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements relating to a consummation of an acquisition where the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of 500 million the credit agreements also contain customary default provisions including defaults for nonpayment breach of representations and warranties insolvency nonperformance of covenants and crossdefaults to other material indebtedness the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreements could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the credit facility being terminated certain representations warranties and covenants under 



the 2018 credit agreement were conformed to those under the 2019 credit facility following an amendment entered into on august 14 2019 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company the credit agreements are available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 12 billion current maximum amount available under the credit agreements the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2019  we had 1867 million of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 201 and a weightedaverage maturity of 39 days  the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2019 and 2018  

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 286 billion at december 31 2019  compared to 140 billion at december 31 2018  in addition at december 31 2019  we had the ability to borrow 101 billion under our commercial paper program and the credit agreements and 2834 million under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our credit agreements we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the credit agreements as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2019 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 823 million at december 31 2019  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2019 in thousands 







 amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” are expected to approximate 13 million in 2020  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 134 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2019  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 212 million and 229 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 261 million and 130 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make acquisitions make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future our main focus over the next three years in terms of uses of cash will be investing in growth of the businesses and the return of value to shareholders additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity in 2019 we announced that we have begun to pursue opportunities to divest our pcs and fine chemistry services businesses with the expectation that each divestiture will be completed in 2020 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before 2021 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

as previously reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and the dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 6131 million as of december 31 2019  of which 5656 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money 



market investments with no limitations on access the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 480 million  429 million and 401 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2019 totaled approximately 426 million  a decrease of 70 million from 496 million at december 31 2018  see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 444 million  473 million and 281 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen chinese renminbi australian dollar and chilean peso in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to 



minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged in the fourth quarter of 2019 we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the cash flow exposure of nonfunctional currency purchases during the construction of the kemerton plant in australia this contract has been designated as an effective hedging instrument and beginning the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of this contract to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss all other gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as an effective hedging instrument are recognized in other expenses net and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2019  our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 163 billion and with a fair value representing a net asset position of 38 million  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2019  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately 354 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase of approximately 438 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2019  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in january 2017 we repaid €3070 million of these senior notes using proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business this repayment did not impair the designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 3940 million and 3138 million outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively these borrowings represented 13 and 18 of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 246 and 285 at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 25 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 10 million as of december 31 2019  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

competition 

the global lithium market consists of producers primarily located in the americas asia and australia major competitors in lithium compounds include livent corporation sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa sichuan tianqi lithium and jiangxi ganfeng lithium in the cesium and other specialty metal business key competitors include cabot corporation and sigmaaldrich corporation competition in the global lithium market is largely based on product quality product diversity reliability of supply and customer service 



raw materials and significant supply contracts 

we obtain lithium through solar evaporation of our ponds at the salar de atacama in chile and in silver peak nevada after we obtain the lithium brine from the salar de atacama we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at a plant in nearby la negra chile the lithium brine from our silver peak site is processed into lithium carbonate at our plant in silver peak subsequently in other locations in the united states “us” germany france and taiwan we further process the materials into various derivatives depending on the markets we serve in addition in december 2018 we purchased undeveloped land with access to a lithium resource in antofalla within the catamarca province of argentina from bolland minera sa if necessary we can also obtain lithium from other sources 

our mineral rights with respect to the salar de atacama in chile consist exclusively of our right to access lithium brine covering an area of approximately 16700 hectares pursuant to a longterm contract with the chilean government originally entered into in january 1975 by one of our predecessors and subsequently amended and restated the amended agreement provides us with sufficient lithium to produce over 80000 metric tons annually of technical and battery grade lithium salts over the next 25 years at our expanding battery grade manufacturing facilities in la negra chile in addition the amended agreement provides for commission payments to the chilean government based on sales pricemetric ton our support of research and development in chile in lithium applications and solar energy and our support of local communities in northern chile in march 2018 we received approval from chilean economic development agency “corfo” to increase lithium production quota in chile to as much as 145000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent annually through 2043 after developing an innovative technology that could lead to a sustainable increase in total lithium production in chile without the need for additional brine pumping at the salar de atacama 

our mineral rights in silver peak nevada consist of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to our permitted and certified senior water rights a settlement agreement with the us government originally entered into in june 1991 and our patented and unpatented land claims pursuant to the 1991 agreement our water rights and our land claims we have rights to all lithium that we can remove economically from the clayton valley basin in nevada we have been operating at the silver peak site since 1966 our silver peak site covers a surface of approximately 15301 acres 10826 acres of which we own through a subsidiary the remaining acres are owned by the us government from whom we lease the land pursuant to unpatented land claims that are renewed annually based on our 2018 production levels we believe that the amount of lithium brine we can economically obtain from our silver peak nevada site pursuant to our rights could support the current levels of lithium carbonate production for approximately 20 years assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied our annual lithium carbonate production capacity is estimated to be at least 6000 metric tons at our silver peak facility however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium carbonate at either silver peak or la negra will be realized 

we also obtain lithium through hard rock mining via our 49 interest in windfield holdings pty ltd which directly owns 100 of the equity of talison lithium pty ltd a company incorporated in australia “talison” talison through its whollyowned subsidiaries owns and operates a lithium mine in greenbushes western australia and mines lithium ore which is then milled and processed to separate lithium concentrate from the rest of the ore the ore is processed into batterygrade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide at our jiangxi and sichuan china facilities talison currently sells the lithium concentrate to its shareholders talison has a leading position in two categories of lithium concentrates i technicalgrade lithium concentrates which have low iron content for use in the manufacture of glass ceramics and heatproof cookware and ii a highyielding chemicalgrade lithium concentrate used to produce lithium chemicals which form the basis for the manufacture of lithiumion batteries for laptop computers mobile phones electric bicycles and electric vehicles assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied the annual lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity at the talison facility is estimated to be approximately 105000 metric tons and will be approximately 190000 metric tons upon completion of an expansion currently underway with commissioning expected in 2019 however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium concentrate at talison will be realized 

in december 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 50 interest in mineral resources limiteds wodgina hard rock lithium mine project “wodgina project” and form a joint venture with mineral resources limited to own and operate the wodgina project to produce spodumene concentrate and battery grade lithium hydroxide under this agreement we would jointly fund design build and operate a battery grade lithium hydroxide plant in stages at wodgina located in the pilbara region of western australia this transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2019 

bromine specialties segment 

our bromine and brominebased business includes products used in fire safety solutions and other specialty chemicals applications our fire safety technology enables the use of plastics in high performance high heat applications by enhancing the flame resistant properties of these materials end market products that benefit from our fire safety technology include plastic 



enclosures for consumer electronics printed circuit boards wire and cable products electrical connectors textiles and foam insulation our brominebased business also includes specialty chemicals products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals these specialty products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids mercury control water purification beef and poultry processing and various other industrial applications other specialty chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides and disinfectants and sanitizers a number of customers of our bromine business operate in cyclical industries including the consumer electronics and oil field industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical 

competition 

our bromine business serves the markets in the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace our most significant competitors are lanxess ag and israel chemicals ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the bromine we use is sourced from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our bromine production operations in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we estimate that at current production levels we will be able to produce bromine in arkansas for decades in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we source bromine from the dead sea which is believed to have indefinite quantities of brine 

catalysts segment 

our three main product lines in this segment are i clean fuels technologies “cft” which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” together with isomerization and akylation catalysts ii fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” catalysts and additives and iii performance catalyst solutions “pcs” which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives 

we offer a wide range of hpc products which are applied throughout the refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes we continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market 

we provide our customers with customized fcc catalyst systems fcc catalysts assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs 

within our pcs product line we manufacture organometallic cocatalysts eg aluminum magnesium and zinc alkyls used in the manufacture of alphaolefins ie hexene octene decene polyolefins polyethylene and polypropylene and electronics our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes epoxies and other engineered resins 

in 2018 the number of refineries worldwide was approximately 615 over the longterm we expect to see some smaller refineries shutting down and being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries with growth concentrated in the middle east and asia oil refining has again increased moderately compared to the previous year we estimate that there are currently approximately 565  fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3200  hpc units being operated globally or a capacity of approximately 46 million barrels per day each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to four years 

on april 3 2018 we completed the sale of the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of the pcs business “polyolefin catalysts divestiture” to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of 4136 million  the transaction included albemarle’s process development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at the yeosu south korea site the sale did not include our organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business the polyolefin catalysts divestiture reflects the company’s commitment to investing in the future growth of its high priority businesses and returning capital to shareholders 



competition 

our catalysts segment serves the global market including the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive competition in these markets is driven by a variety factors product performance and quality price and contract terms product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace in addition through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

our major competitors in the cft catalysts market include criterion catalysts and technologies advanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co basf corporation and china petrochemical corporation sinopec in the pcs market our major competitors include nouryon lanxess ag and lonza 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin aluminum ethylene alphaolefins isobutylene toluene and rare earths and metals such as molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers globally we also utilize commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2018  we owned approximately 2100  active patents and approximately 600  pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act “osha” we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2018  with an osha occupational injury and illness incident rate of 058  for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 063  in 2017  

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments 



additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

in june 2016 modifications to the toxic substances control act “tsca” in the us were signed into law requiring chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the us as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further details 



climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities we provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

during recent years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries in addition we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses which do not fit our high priority business growth profile following is a summary of our significant acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures over the last three years 

in december 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 50 interest in mineral resources limiteds wodgina project located in the pilbara region of western australia and form a joint venture with mineral resources limited to own and operate the wodgina project to produce spodumene concentrate and battery grade lithium hydroxide for a purchase price of 115 billion this transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2019 

on april 3 2018 we completed the polyolefin catalysts divestiture to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million  the transaction includes albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale does not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business 

on december 31 2016 we completed the acquisition of the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of jiangxi jiangli new materials science and technology co ltd “jiangli new materials” for a purchase price of approximately 145 million this includes manufacturing assets and supporting business functions located in both jiangxi and sichuan china focused on the production of batterygrade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide we believe this acquisition will enable us to supply premium lithium salts to an expanded global customer base while solidifying our leading position in the lithium industry 

on december 14 2016 we completed the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for net cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion the chemetall surface treatment business was originally part of our previously reported 2015 acquisition of rockwood holdings inc “rockwood” 

on january 4 2016 we completed the sale of our metal sulfides business to treibacher industrie ag for net proceeds of approximately 137 million included in the transaction were sites in vienna and arnoldstein austria and tribotecc’s proprietary sulfide synthesis process on february 1 2016 we completed the sale of our mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business to huber engineered materials a division of jm huber corporation for net proceeds of approximately 187 million the transaction included albemarle’s martinswerk gmbh subsidiary and manufacturing facility located in bergheim germany and albemarle’s 50 ownership interest in magnifin magnesiaprodukte gmbh a jointventure with radex heraklith industriebeteiligung ag at breitenau austria 

these transactions reflect our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses maintaining leverage flexibility and returning capital to our shareholders

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us with approximately 74  of our sales to foreign countries we operate andor sell our products to customers in approximately 100  countries we currently have many production facilities research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the us as detailed in item 2 properties accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 





 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in regions of the world such as the middle east and south america that are of high risk due to significant civil political and security instability unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

furthermore we are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery and antitrust prohibitions of the us and other countries as well as export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will in part depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities which could adversely impact us furthermore other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to do so or may be delayed in doing so in addition raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 

competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

we compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins and profitability our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

in addition albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims whether with or without merit against our company or its products imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us or are otherwise 



disparaging of our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing end markets as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all as may be required to replace or enhance existing products and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position 

in addition our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

despite our efforts we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace furthermore ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 

adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a global regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national regional and global economies including economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 

downturns in our customers’ industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries which are cyclical in nature or which are subject to secular market downturns historically cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to four years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the 



useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union “eu” continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under reach which imposes obligations on eu manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the eu to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain see “regulation” in item 1 business our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the eu requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

in june 2016 modifications to the tsca in the us were signed into law requiring chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the us as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us 



a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation as well as natural resource extraction including explosions fires severe weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of disruptions shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous us and nonus national federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties we currently use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities including for example current and prior property owners or operators as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify 

further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing registrationapproval requirements transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years we expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity 



obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar foreign anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management if we are found to be liable for violations of the fcpa or other applicable anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our joint ventures we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as previously reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the us department of justice “doj” the sec and dutch public prosecutor “dpp” and are cooperating with the doj the sec and the dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses 

we are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business 

we are subject to government regulation in nonus jurisdictions in which we conduct our business the requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses or require changes in business practice in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries or their enforcement may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or 



patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise in addition our trade secrets and knowhow may be improperly obtained by other means such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft 

our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability 

our lithium reserves will without more decline as we continue to extract these raw materials accordingly our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature exploration projects involve many risks require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably once a site with potential resources is discovered it may take several years of development until production is possible during which time the economic viability of production may change substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities as a result there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions 

we utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project the actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as but not limited to changes in volumes grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made adverse geotechnical conditions availability supply and cost of water and power fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development changes in royalty agreements laws andor regulations around royalties and other taxes and weather or severe climate impacts 

for our existing operations we utilize geological and metallurgical assumptions financial projections and price estimates these estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material revisions to environmental obligations changes in legislation andor social political or economic environment and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable reserves including many factors beyond our control that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges 



there is risk to the growth of lithium markets 

our lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium power and the growth in demand for plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles to the extent that such development adoption and growth do not occur in the volume andor manner that we contemplate the longterm growth in the markets for lithium products may be adversely affected which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches information technology system failures or network disruptions 

attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

in addition risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and around the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program “cfats program” which is administered by the department of homeland security “dhs” identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 “cfats act” was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of the uss chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and the markets for our products in particular the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 



natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and other insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and coverage limits we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations in addition we have operations in the eu brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities and fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions and regulatory changes relating to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our business 

following a referendum in 2016 voters in the united kingdom “uk” approved that country’s exit from the eu a process often referred to as “brexit” subsequently in march 2017 the uk invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty which provides a twoyear time period through march 2019 for the uk and the remaining eu countries to negotiate a withdrawal agreement the future effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent and the uncertainty around the terms upon which the uk will leave the eu it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications brexit would have and how such withdrawal would affect our company we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside the us including 16 from eu countries the consequences of brexit together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of brexit including the possibility of a socalled “hard brexit” where no formal agreement is made between the eu and uk prior to the uk’s exit from the eu could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets 



including volatility in foreign currencies and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate although we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of brexit adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations operating results and financial condition all of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the eu 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team in light of the specialized and technical nature of our business our performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

some of our employees are unionized represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 5900  employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures approximately 35  of these employees are represented by unions or works councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our financial condition 

our required capital expenditures can be complex may experience delays or other difficulties and the costs may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment facilities and properties and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment facilities and properties execution of these capital expenditures can be complex and commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products in addition our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets 



we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including crossdefaults to other debt facilities see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the eu euro japanese yen chinese renminbi south korean won australian dollar chilean peso and taiwan dollar exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 32  of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals 



with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” project on base erosion and profit shifting and the enacted us tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” during the fourth quarter of 2017 may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to rockwood’s periods prior to its acquisition by us these indemnity obligations will continue generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity our earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the applicable tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings which may be material in the future the outcome of proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables 

legal and regulatory proceedings whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other resources inhibit our ability to sell our products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and otherwise negatively affect our business 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those 



earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us uk germany belgium and japan we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 70 million of required cash contributions during 2019  for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2019  may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs and support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 





 we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants in addition the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences and risks for us including 

 if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition

legal proceedings 

tableend

we are involved in litigation incidental to our business and are a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits including but not limited to those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters product liability and breach of contract some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

as previously reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what 



penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period

 we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forwardlooking statements should circumstances change except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k 

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” on page 49 

overview 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that are designed to meet our customers’ needs across a diverse range of end markets the end markets we serve include energy storage petroleum refining consumer electronics construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection and custom chemistry services we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible lowcost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements among other factors position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment 

2018 highlights 







outlook 

the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve in particular the market for lithium battery and energy storage continues to accelerate providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity the other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions such as slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility crude oil price fluctuation a dynamic pricing environment an everchanging landscape in electronics the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders we believe that our businesses remain wellpositioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets 

lithium we expect a similar rate of growth in 2019 as in 2018 in lithium led by continued strong demand in batterygrade applications price improvement and increased conversion capacity 



on a longer term basis we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and full battery electric vehicles increases this demand for lithium is supported against a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium ion battery costs increasing battery performance and an increasingly favorable global public policy toward acceptance of emobilityrenewable energy usage our longterm outlook is also bolstered by our successful negotiation of longterm supply agreements with our key strategic customers reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner highlighted by our scale access to geographically diverse lowcost resource base and longterm focus on execution 

bromine specialties we expect to see continued growth in net sales and profitability in 2019 due to healthy demand and pricing for our flame retardants and other derivatives however with sustained low oil prices we expect stable albeit low drilling completion fluid demand throughout the year while it is possible oil prices could continue to rebound some in 2019 the shortterm impact will be to increase raw material costs offshore well completions lag oil pricing so any benefit in completion fluid volumes would likely extend throughout the year 

on a longer term basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling we would expect this business to follow a longterm growth trajectory once oil prices recover from recent levels as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap could tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expands over time the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets 

catalysts we expect to see continued headwinds from rising raw material costs in both our cft and fcc businesses similar to 2018 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels new refinery startups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our catalysts business we believe delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world including those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields longer term we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio with superior technology and production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that catalysts remains wellpositioned for the future in pcs we expect growth in our organometallic business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending 

on april 3 2018 we completed the polyolefin catalysts divestiture to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million 

all other the fine chemistry services business will continue to be reported outside the company’s reportable segments as it does not fit in the company’s core businesses we expect the near future to be impacted by a challenging agriculture industry environment and the timing of customer orders in pharmaceuticals we continue to work to reinvigorate the pipeline of new products and services to these markets 

corporate  we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate for 2019  to be between 23 and 24 however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us including the tcja and other tax jurisdictions 

in the first quarter of 2019  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 03675  per share during 2018 we received and retired approximately 53 million  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program and asr agreements and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis as approved by our share repurchase program

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2018  our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses decreased   42 million  or 1  from the year ended december 31 2017  sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 included 162 million of charitable contributions beyond the company’s ordinary recurring charitable contributions a decrease in restructuring and other costs related to several locations of 47 million and 39 million less acquisition and integration related costs for various significant projects the remaining decrease was primarily due to lower compensation related costs particularly incentive compensation and professional fees as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 132  in 2018  compared to 147  in 2017  

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2018  our rd expenses decreased   143 million  or 17  from the year ended december 31 2017  included in rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 are 57 million  of restructuring costs related to our lithium sites in germany the remaining decrease was primarily due to 45 million of rd expenses related to the polyolefin catalysts divestiture as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 21  in 2018  compared to 27  in 2017  

gain on sales of businesses net 

the year ended december 31 2018 included a gain before income taxes of 2104 million  related to the polyolefin catalysts divestiture which we completed in the second quarter of 2018 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2018   decreased   629 million  to 524 million  from the corresponding 2017  period due mainly to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 528 million  in 2017 relating to the tender premiums fees unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the repayment of the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million  of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million  of the 450 senior notes the remaining difference is primarily related to the impact of higher capitalized interest from increased capital expenditures in 2018 

other expenses net 

other expenses net for the year ended december 31 2018  was 644 million  compared to 95 million  for the corresponding 2017  period other expenses net for 2018 included approximately 53 million  of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses of 140 million  as compared to 161 million  of pension and opeb benefits 



including marktomarket actuarial gains of 114 million  in 2017 in addition during the year ended december 31 2018  we incurred 270 million of legal expenses related to products that albemarle no longer manufactures and a previously disposed business 197 million  to increase an indemnification liability related to the settlement of an ongoing audit of a previously disposed business in germany and 156 million of environmental charges related to a site formerly owned by albemarle partially offset by a 21 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a 287 million reserve recorded against a note receivable in one of our european entities no longer deemed probable of collection 110 million of charges related to previously disposed properties or businesses partially offset by a 106 million  gain related to the reversal of liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting from a previous acquisition a 62 million  gain related to the acquisition of the 50 interest of an equity investment and 11 million related to a reversal of a liability associated with the previous disposal of a property the remaining change was primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses totaling 06 million and a decrease in interest income 

the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2018 is primarily attributable  to a lower return on pension plan assets in 2018 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us and foreign pension plan assets was 455  versus an expected return of 673  the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2018 was partially offset by an increase in the weightedaverage discount rate to 459  from 403  for our us pension plans and to 215  from 194  for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2018 measurement date 

the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2017 is primarily attributable to a higher return on pension plan assets in 2017 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us and foreign pension plan assets was 1431  versus an expected return of 673  the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate to 403  from 443  for our us pension plans and to 194  from 200  for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2017 measurement date 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate for 2018  was 182  compared to 966  for 2017  our effective income tax rate for 2018 was primarily affected by a tax benefit of 423 million related to the refinement of the onetime transition tax during the period defined by staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” in addition our effective income tax rate was impacted by the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates 

our effective income tax rate for 2017 was primarily affected by the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 during 2017 provisional tax effects of the tcja were recorded in connection with the onetime transition tax expense of 4292 million partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 of 623 million tax benefit exclusive of the enactment of the tcja the company’s effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of earnings from outside the us mainly attributable to our share of the income of our jbc joint venture a free zones company under the laws of the hashemite kingdom of jordan in addition income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 included foreign rate changes of 162 million and a 51 million outofperiod adjustment due to changes in our deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in chilean fixed assets partially offset by a 109 million benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to a foreign restructuring plan that was initiated during the second quarter of 2017 and a 88 million benefit from excess tax benefits realized from stockbased compensation arrangements

segment information overview  we have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions our reportable business segments consist of 1 lithium 2 bromine specialties and 3 catalysts 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables results for 2017 have been recast to reflect the change in segments previously noted the “all other” category includes only the fine chemistry services business that does not fit into any of our core businesses 

the corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporaterelated items not allocated to the operating segments pension and opeb service cost which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments all other and corporate whereas the remaining components of pension and opeb benefits cost or credit “nonoperating pension and opeb items” are included in corporate segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs 

the company’s chief operating decision maker uses adjusted ebitda as defined below to assess the ongoing performance of the company’s business segments and to allocate resources the company defines adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain nonrecurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis these nonrecurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration related costs utilization of inventory markup gains or losses on sales of businesses restructuring charges facility divestiture charges nonoperating pension and opeb items and other significant nonrecurring items in addition management uses adjusted ebitda for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performancebased compensation for management and other employees the company has reported adjusted ebitda because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables periodtoperiod comparability of financial performance adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is not required by or presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to albemarle corporation the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with us gaap or any other financial measure reported in accordance with us gaap

net income attributable to albemarle corporation decreased  to 549 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 6437 million  for the corresponding period of 2016  the year ended december 31 2017 was negatively impacted by the onetime transition tax expense of 4292 million recorded as a result of the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 in addition the year ended december 31 2017 included a 528 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and 171 million of restructuring and other costs while the year ended december 31 2016 included net gains of 2505 million after income taxes related to the sale of businesses including discontinued operations excluding these items net income attributable to albemarle increased by 1608 million the increase was primarily due to the increase in gross profit from higher overall sales volumes and favorable price impacts the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 of 623 million tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the tcja and lower acquisition and integration related costs partially offset by an increase in sga expenses income before taxes from discontinued operations in 2016 and the negative impact of hurricane harvey 

other comprehensive income net of tax 

total other comprehensive income after income taxes was 1876 million  in 2017  compared to 83 million  in 2016  this change is primarily due to changes in foreign currency translations we translate our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to us dollars in 2017  other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation 



adjustments was 2274 million  mainly as a result of favorable movements in the euro of approximately 192 million the korean won of approximately 16 million the chinese renminbi of approximately 13 million and the taiwan dollar of approximately 4 million also included in total other comprehensive income for 2017  is a loss of 418 million  in connection with the revaluation of our eurobased 1875 senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations in 2016  other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was 208 million  mainly as a result of unfavorable movements in the british pound sterling of approximately 25 million the chinese renminbi of approximately 12 million the korean won of approximately 6 million the turkish lira of approximately 6 million partially offset by favorable movements in the euro of approximately 15 million and the brazilian real of approximately 13 million included in the currency movements for 2016 is the favorable effect of 814 million in accumulated foreign currency translation losses that were reversed as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business also included in total other comprehensive income for 2016  is income of 261 million  in connection with the revaluation of our eurobased 1875 senior notes and which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations 

segment information overview  summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables results for 2017 and 2016 have been recast to reflect the change in segments previously noted 





see below for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda the nongaap financial measure from net income attributable to albemarle corporation the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap in thousands 







 lithium 

lithium segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2017  were 102 billion  up 3500 million  or 52   in comparison to the same period in 2016  the increase was primarily driven by 1632 million of favorable lithium sales volumes largely from battery grade applications due to market demand and 1863 million of favorable lithium price impacts due primarily to price increases in our battery grade lithium salts adjusted ebitda for lithium increased 56  or 1609 million  to 4467 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period of 2016  primarily due to favorable pricing and higher overall sales volumes partially offset by lithium growth spending and 04 million of unfavorable currency translation impacts 

bromine specialties 

bromine specialties segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2017  were 8551 million  up 627 million  or 8   compared to the corresponding period of 2016  the increase was driven primarily by 604 million of higher sales volumes due to strong demand in flame retardants and reduced production in 2017 by chinese bromine companies and 23 million of favorable pricing on certain bromine derivatives adjusted ebitda for bromine specialties increased 14  or 320 million  to 2589 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period of 2016  primarily due to higher overall sales volumes and favorable pricing partially offset by higher variable and fixed costs and a 15 million negative impact from hurricane harvey 

catalysts 

catalysts segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2017  were 107 billion  an increase of 361 million  or 3  compared to the corresponding period of 2016  this increase was primarily due to 487 million of higher volumes from strong demand in our customer base and 28 million of favorable currency exchange impacts partially offset by 155 million of unfavorable price impacts due to customer and product mix and the bankruptcy filing of one of our customers catalysts adjusted ebitda decreased 10  or 327 million  to 2839 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the corresponding period of 2016  primarily due to unfavorable price and mix impacts higher costs and a 138 million negative impact from hurricane harvey partially offset by 23 million of favorable currency translation impacts 

all other 

all other net sales for the year ended december 31 2017  were 1289 million  a decrease of 521 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  this decrease was primarily due to the impact of the sale of the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business of 386 million as well as unfavorable fine chemistry services pricing impacts due to a contract formula change which did not impact earnings all other adjusted ebitda was down 6  or 09 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  in comparison to the same period of 2016  the year ended december 31 2016 included the impact of the sale of the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business of 34 million and a 29 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities 



corporate 

corporate adjusted ebitda was a charge of 1178 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase of 320 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to increased compensation costs professional fees and 135 million of unfavorable currency impacts 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

property plant and equipment  we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from two  to sixty  years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our longterm mineral rights which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates market prices and tax rates among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes  we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions 

environmental remediation liabilities  we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers a performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer the transaction price of a contract or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments if applicable for any variable consideration such as customer rebates noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer although these adjustments are generally not material where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation although these situations do not occur frequently and are generally not built into our contracts any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers which in some cases is based on established market 



prices sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days however they vary by market factors such as customer size creditworthiness geography and competitive environment 

all of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days costs for shipping and handling activities whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods are accounted for as fulfillment costs 

the company currently utilizes the following practical expedients as permitted by accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  

 certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer in management’s judgment control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time upon shipment or delivery and not over the time they are produced therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products 

costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less when the company incurs preproduction or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates which is less than one year we record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions about sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions income taxes working capital and other economic or marketrelated factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2018  and concluded there was no 



impairment as of that date in addition no material indications of impairment in any of our reporting units were indicated by the sensitivity analysis 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents and customer lists are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five  to twentyfive  years except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our lithium business which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

resource development expenses 

we incur costs in resource exploration evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects exploration costs incurred before obtaining legal rights to explore an area are generally expensed as incurred after obtaining legal rights exploration costs are expensed in areas where we have uncertainty about obtaining proven resources in areas where we have substantial knowledge about the area and consider it probable to obtain commercially viable proven resources exploration and evaluation costs are capitalized 

if technical feasibility studies have been obtained resource evaluation expenses are capitalized when the study demonstrates proven or probable resources for which future economic returns are expected while costs for projects that are not considered viable are expensed development costs that are necessary to bring the property to commercial production or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred 

capitalized resource costs are depleted using the unitsofproduction method our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a monthly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 



during 2018  we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2018  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2018  measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2018  the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans was increased to 459  and 215  respectively from 403  and 194  respectively at december 31 2017  to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2018  measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2018  and 2017  was 455  and 399  respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2018  and 2017  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 689  and the weightedaverage expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 552  and 616  respectively effective january 1 2019  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 689  and 569  respectively the weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 700  during 2018  and 2017  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2018  and 2017 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 363  and 318  respectively for our foreign pension plans 

in october 2017 the society of actuaries “soa” published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2017 the updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data 2015 we utilized the same base soa rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the mp2017 mortality improvement scale for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2017   in october 2018 the soa published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2018 the updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data 2016 we utilized the same base mortality soa rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the mp2018 mortality improvement scale for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2018 

at december 31 2018  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 



a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 5837 million  total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2018  720 million  or approximately 12  are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2011 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2011 

         with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process we have audits ongoing for the years 2006 through 2017 related to germany taiwan italy india belgium and chile some of which are for entities that have since been divested 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 



since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 44 million  as a result of closure of tax statutes as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in 2016 we agreed to indemnify certain income and nonincome tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions associated with the entities sold the associated liability is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities see note 16 “other noncurrent liabilities” and note 20 “income taxes” for further details 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested we will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law in the us the tcja contains several key tax provisions including among other things the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the requirement of companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings such as global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” a company can elect an accounting policy to account for gilti as a period charge in the future period the tax arises or as part of deferred taxes related to the investment or subsidiary the company has elected to account for gilti as a period cost 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs funding working capital and service of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 5553 million  at december 31 2018  as compared to 114 billion  at december 31 2017  cash provided by operating activities was 5462 million  3040 million  and 7355 million  during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 versus 2017 was primarily due to higher income tax payments in 2017 including approximately 257 million of income taxes from the gain on sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in addition 2018 benefited from increased earnings in each of our reportable segments increased dividends received from unconsolidated investments and lower interest payments this was partially offset by increased 



receivables from higher net sales during 2018 and the buildup of inventory in our lithium and catalysts segments due to higher forecasted sales the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to the 2017 income tax payment noted above that was recorded in income taxes payable in 2016 in addition the decrease resulted from the buildup of inventory in the lithium reportable segment in 2017 this was partially offset by increased overall sales volumes and prices lower acquisition and integration related costs and lower interest payments in 2017 as compared to 2016 

during 2018  cash on hand cash provided by operations and 4136 million  of net proceeds from divestitures funded 1147 million  of commercial paper repayments net of borrowings 5000 million   of accelerated share repurchase programs   7000 million  of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development dividends to shareholders of 1446 million  and pension and postretirement contributions of 152 million  during 2017 cash on hand cash provided by operations and net borrowings of 1388 million funded 7782 million of debt repayments 3177 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment a 2500 million accelerated share repurchase program dividends to shareholders of 1406 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 133 million during 2016 cash on hand cash provided by operations and 333 billion of cash proceeds from divestitures funded 142 billion of debt repayments 1967 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1354 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 201 million in addition during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 400 million 1025 million and 1050 million respectively which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 148 million  368 million and 359 million respectively 

on april 3 2018 we completed the polyolefin catalysts divestiture to wr grace  co for net cash proceeds of approximately 4136 million  and recorded a gain of 2104 million  before income taxes in 2018 related to the sale of this business the transaction includes albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale did not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business the polyolefin catalysts divestiture reflects our commitment to investing in the future growth of our high priority businesses and returning capital to our shareholders 

on december 14 2016 we completed the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion net of purchase price adjustments as a result of the sale we recorded a gain of 3880 million  before income taxes and a tax liability of 2530 million related to the difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests sold in 2016 we used the proceeds to significantly reduce leverage including repaying the outstanding balance of the september 2015 term loan in full and approximately 153 million of commercial paper notes in december 2016 in addition during the first quarter of 2017 we repaid the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million  of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million  of the 450 senior notes as well as related redemption premiums of 452 million  

in 2016 we also completed the sales of our metal sulfides business and our mineralbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses for net proceeds of approximately 137 million and 187 million respectively the net proceeds from both sales were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the september 2015 term loan agreement 

capital expenditures were 7000 million  3177 million  and 1967 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment and mining resource development the increase in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily driven by expansion in our lithium business capital expenditures for discontinued operations were 193 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 we expect our capital expenditures to be between 800 million and 900 million in 2019  for lithium growth mining resource development and capacity increases as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments of the total capital expenditures our projects related to the continuity of operations is expected to remain in the range of 46 of net sales similar to prior years 

during 2018 we incurred 194 million  of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects during 2017 we incurred 339 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects including the jiangli new materials acquisition which contains nonroutine compensation related costs negotiated specifically as a result of this acquisition that are outside of the company’s ordinary course compensation arrangements during 2016 we incurred 521 million  of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood mainly consisting of professional services costs to achieve synergies relocation costs and other integration costs and 53 million  of costs in connection with other significant projects 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under our share repurchase program pursuant to which the company was permitted to repurchase up to a maximum 



of 15000000  shares including those previously authorized but not yet repurchased under our existing board authorized share repurchase program during 2018 and 2017 the company repurchased approximately 53 million  shares and 23 million  shares of our common stock respectively which reduced the company’s weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively all of the shares repurchased in 2018 and 2017 were also repurchased pursuant to the terms of asr agreements with major financial institutions as of december 31 2018 there were 7396263  remaining shares available for repurchase under the company’s authorized share repurchase program there were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2016 

net current assets decreased to approximately 8152 million  at december 31 2018  from 128 billion  at december 31 2017  with the decrease being largely due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents to fund the asr programs we entered into during 2018 and capital expenditure projects additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business 

on february 26 2019  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 03675  per share a 10  increase from the quarterly rate of 0335  per share paid in 2018 

at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  our cash and cash equivalents included 5258 million  and 110 billion  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we repatriated approximately 6218 million  205 million  and 537 million  of cash respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities a portion of the cash repatriations was used to repay a net amount of 1147 million  of commercial paper during 2018 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have the following senior notes outstanding 



our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before its maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures the senior notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default 



on june 21 2018 we entered into the 2018 credit agreement to replace our revolving unsecured credit agreement dated as of february 7 2014 as amended the 2018 credit agreement currently provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion and matures on june 23 2023 borrowings under the 2018 credit agreement bear interest at variable rates based on an average london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0910 to 1500 depending on the company’s credit rating from standard  poor’s rating services moody’s investors services and fitch ratings the applicable margin on the facility was 1125 as of december 31 2018 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2018 credit agreement as of december 31 2018 

borrowings under the 2018 credit agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including the absence of defaults the company is subject to one financial covenant as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants the financial covenant requires that the company’s consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio as such terms are defined in the 2018 credit agreement to be less than or equal to 350100 subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the 2018 credit agreement relating to a consummation of an acquisition where the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of 500 million the 2018 credit agreement also contains customary default provisions including defaults for nonpayment breach of representations and warranties insolvency nonperformance of covenants and crossdefaults to other material indebtedness the occurrence of an event of default under the 2018 credit agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the credit facility being terminated 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company our 2018 credit agreement is available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2018 credit agreement and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 10 billion current maximum amount available under the 2018 credit agreement the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2018  we had 3066 million  of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 291  and a weightedaverage maturity of 38 days  during 2018 we repaid a net amount of 1147 million   of commercial paper notes using cash on hand   the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 140 billion  at december 31 2018  compared to 142 billion  at december 31 2017  in addition at december 31 2018  we had the ability to borrow 6934 million  under our commercial paper program and the 2018 credit agreement and 2510 million  under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our 2018 credit agreement we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the 2018 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2018  we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 718 million  at december 31 2018  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 



other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2018  in thousands 



 amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” are expected to approximate 12 million  in 2019  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 129 million  to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2018  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 229 million  and 244 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 130 million  and 146 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures including the polyolefin catalysts divestiture and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make acquisitions make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future our main focus over the next three years in terms of uses of cash will be investing in growth of the businesses and the return of value to shareholders additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity for example we expect that the purchase price for the announced acquisition of the wodgina project of approximately 115 billion will be funded with available cash and new debt borrowings 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit 



efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before 2020 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

as previously reported in 2018 following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business within our catalysts segment to the doj the sec and the dpp and are cooperating with the doj the sec and dpp in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with the investigations by the doj the sec or dpp we are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj the sec or dpp or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any such fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 5553 million  as of december 31 2018  of which 5258 million  is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 429 million  401 million  and 344 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2018  totaled approximately 496 million  an increase  of 98 million  from 398 million  at december 31 2017  see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 473 million  281 million  and 288 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen chinese renminbi south korean won australian dollar chilean peso and taiwan dollar in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged unless otherwise noted gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in other expenses net and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2018  our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 6265 million  and with a fair value representing a net asset position of 04 million  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2018  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease  of approximately 244 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase  of approximately 268 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2018  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in january 2017 we repaid €3070 million  of these senior notes using proceeds from 



the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business this repayment did not impair the designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 3138 million  and 4266 million  outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively these borrowings represented 18  and 23  of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 285  and 178  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 29  basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 09 million  as of december 31 2018  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

business segments 

during 2017  we managed and reported our operations under three reportable segments lithium and advanced materials bromine specialties and refining solutions each segment has a dedicated team of sales research and development process engineering manufacturing and sourcing and business strategy personnel and has full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus agility and responsiveness financial results and discussion about our segments included in this annual report on form 10k are organized according to these categories except where noted otherwise 

for financial information regarding our reportable segments including revenues generated for each of the last three fiscal years from each of the product categories included in our reportable segments and geographic area information see note 24 “segment and geographic area information” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

in november 2017 we announced that during the first quarter of 2018 the performance catalyst solutions pcs product category will merge with the refining solutions reportable segment to form a global business focused on catalysts as a result our three reportable segments will include 1 lithium 2 bromine specialties and 3 catalysts 

lithium and advanced materials segment 

as of december 31 2017  our lithium and advanced materials segment consisted of two product categories lithium and pcs 

lithium  our lithium business develops advanced materials for a wide range of industries and end markets our lithium business is a lowcost producer of one of the most diverse product portfolios of lithium derivatives in the industry 

we develop and manufacture a broad range of basic lithium compounds including lithium carbonate lithium hydroxide lithium chloride and valueadded lithium specialties and reagents including butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride lithium is a key component in products and processes used in a variety of applications and industries which include lithium batteries used in consumer electronics and automobiles high performance greases thermoplastic elastomers for car tires rubber soles and plastic bottles catalysts for chemical reactions organic synthesis processes in the areas of steroid chemistry and vitamins various life science applications as well as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry among other applications we also develop and manufacture cesium products for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and zirconium barium and titanium products for various pyrotechnical applications including airbag initiators 



in addition to developing and supplying lithium compounds we provide technical services including the handling and use of reactive lithium products we also offer our customers recycling services for lithiumcontaining byproducts resulting from synthesis with organolithium products lithium metal and other reagents we plan to continue to focus on the development of new products and applications 

lithium — competition 

the global lithium market consists of producers located in the americas asiapacific and to a lesser extent africa we are a leading global provider of lithium compounds major competitors include fmc corporation sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa sichuantianqi lithium and jiangxi ganfeng lithium in the metalbased specialty chemicals business key competitors include cabot corporation and sigmaaldrich corporation competition in the global lithium market is largely based on product quality product diversity reliability of supply and customer service 

lithium — raw materials and significant supply contracts 

we obtain lithium through solar evaporation of our ponds at the salar de atacama in chile and in silver peak nevada after we obtain the lithium brine from the salar de atacama we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at a plant in nearby la negra chile the lithium brine from our silver peak site is processed into lithium carbonate at our plant in silver peak subsequently in other locations in the united states “us” germany france and taiwan we further process the materials into various derivatives depending on the markets we serve in addition we have entered an agreement with bolland minera sa for the exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium resource in antofalla within the catamarca province of argentina if necessary we can also obtain lithium from other sources 

our mineral rights with respect to the salar de atacama in chile consist exclusively of our right to access lithium brine covering an area of approximately 16700 hectares pursuant to a longterm contract with the chilean government originally entered into in january 1975 by one of our predecessors and subsequently amended and restated in 2016 we were granted approval by the environmental assessment commission of the antofagasta region to increase our currently authorized lithium brine removal rate in the salar de atacama in addition to amending our lithium production rights agreement with the chilean economic development agency “corfo” to both extend the term of that agreement and increase our authorized lithium quota at our facility in the salar de atacama chile the agreement provides for commission payments to the chilean government based on sales pricemt and our support of research and development in chile in lithium applications and solar energy the amended agreement provides us with sufficient lithium to produce over 80000 metric tons annually of technical and battery grade lithium salts over the next 26 years at our expanding battery grade manufacturing facilities in la negra chile in september 2017 we announced that we have developed an innovative technology that could lead to a sustainable increase in total lithium production in chile to as much as 125000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent annually without the need for additional brine pumping at the salar de atacama as a result of this development we have requested that corfo increase our lithium quota as of the date of this annual report corfo is yet to conclude on the company’s request 

our mineral rights in silver peak nevada consist of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to our permitted and certified senior water rights a settlement agreement with the us government originally entered into in june 1991 and our patented and unpatented land claims pursuant to the 1991 agreement our water rights and our land claims we have rights to all lithium that we can remove economically from the clayton valley basin in nevada we have been operating at the silver peak site since 1966 our silver peak site covers a surface of approximately 15301 acres 10826 acres of which we own through a subsidiary the remaining acres are owned by the us government from whom we lease the land pursuant to unpatented land claims that are renewed annually based on our 2017 production levels we believe that the amount of lithium brine we can economically obtain from our silver peak nevada site pursuant to our rights could support the current levels of lithium carbonate production for approximately 20 years assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied our annual lithium carbonate production capacity is estimated to be approximately 6000 metric tons at our silver peak facility however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium carbonate at either silver peak or la negra will be realized 

we also own a 49 interest in windfield holdings pty ltd which directly owns 100 of the equity of talison lithium pty ltd a company incorporated in australia “talison” talison through its whollyowned subsidiaries owns and operates a lithium mine in greenbushes western australia and mines lithium ore which is then milled and processed to separate lithium concentrate from the rest of the ore the ore is processed into batterygrade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide at our jiangxi and sichuan china facilities which were recently acquired by us from jiangxi jiangli new materials science and technology co ltd “jiangli new materials” talison currently sells the lithium concentrate to its shareholders talison has a leading position in two categories of lithium concentrates i technicalgrade lithium concentrates which have low iron content for use in the manufacture of glass ceramics and heatproof cookware and ii a highyielding chemicalgrade lithium concentrate used to produce lithium chemicals which form the basis for the manufacture of lithiumion batteries for laptop 



computers mobile phones electric bicycles and electric vehicles assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied the annual lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity at the talison facility is estimated to be approximately 80000 metric tons however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium concentrate at talison will be realized

limited “jbc” a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we source bromine from the dead sea which is believed to have indefinite quantities of brine 

refining solutions segment 

our two main product lines in this segment are i clean fuels technologies “cft” which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” together with isomerization and akylation catalysts and ii fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” catalysts and additives hpc products are widely applied throughout the refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes we continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market fcc catalysts assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs we offer a wide range of hpc products and provide customized fcc catalyst systems to our customers 

in 2017 the total number of refineries world wide remained at 615 over the longterm we expect to see some smaller refineries shutting down and being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries with growth concentrated in the middle east and asia oil refining has again increased moderately compared to the previous year we estimate that there are currently approximately 565  fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3200  hpc units being operated globally or a capacity of approximately 46 million barrels per day each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to four years 

competition 

our refining solutions segment serves the global market including the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive and driven by different factors product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract 

research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

our major competitors in the cft catalysts market include criterion catalysts and technologies advanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co basf corporation and china petrochemical corporation sinopec

product development through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

we incurred research and development expenses of 843 million  805 million  and 892 million  during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2017  we owned approximately 2100  active patents and approximately 800  pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act “osha” we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2017  with an osha occupational injury and illness incident rate of 063  for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 053  in 2016  

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

in june 2016 modifications to the toxic substances control act “tsca” in the us were signed into law requiring chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the us as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 



we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further details 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities we provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

over the last three years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries in addition we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses which do not fit our high priority business growth profile following is a summary of our significant acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures during recent years 

on december 14 2017 we signed a definitive agreement to sell the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of our pcs business to wr grace  co for proceeds of approximately 416 million in cash the transaction includes albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale does not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business the sale of the polyolefin catalysts business and components reflects our commitment to investing in the future growth of our high priority businesses and returning capital to shareholders the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including approvals from regulatory authorities

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us with approximately 73  of our sales to foreign countries in addition we operate andor sell our products to customers in approximately 100  countries we currently have many production facilities research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the united states as detailed in item 2 properties accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 



 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in regions of the world such as the middle east and south america that are of high risk due to significant civil political and security instability unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

furthermore we are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery prohibitions of the us and other countries and export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will in part depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities which could adversely impact us furthermore other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our 



raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to do so or may be delayed in doing so in addition raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 

competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

we compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins and profitability our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

in addition albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims whether with or without merit against our company or its products imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us or are otherwise disparaging of our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing end markets as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all as may be required to replace or enhance existing products and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position 

in addition our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

despite our efforts we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace furthermore ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 



adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a global regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national regional and global economies including economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 

downturns in our customers’ industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries which are cyclical in nature or which are subject to secular market downturns historically cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to four years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under reach which imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain see “regulation” in item 1 business our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union 



requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

in june 2016 modifications to the tsca in the us were signed into law requiring chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the us as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and resource extraction businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of disruptions or material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties we currently use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without 



regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities including for example current and prior property owners or operators as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify 

further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing registrationapproval requirements transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years we expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar foreign anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management if we are found to be liable for violations of the fcpa or other applicable anticorruption laws either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including employees of our joint ventures we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal 



investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business to the us department of justice “doj” and sec and intend to cooperate with the doj and sec in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with any investigations by the doj or sec we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj or sec or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations however could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses 

we are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business 

we are subject to government regulation in nonus jurisdictions in which we conduct our business the requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses or require changes in business practice in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations can require may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries or their enforcement may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise in addition our trade secrets and knowhow may be improperly obtained by other means such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft 



our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches information technology system failures or network disruptions 

attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 

in addition risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information which could adversely effect our business or results of operations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and around the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program “cfats program” which is administered by the department of homeland security “dhs” identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 “cfats act” was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of the uss chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and the markets for our products in particular the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 



our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and other insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and coverage limits we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations in addition we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities and fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions and regulatory changes relating to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our business 

following a referendum in 2016 voters in the united kingdom “uk” approved that country’s exit from the european union “eu” a process often referred to as “brexit” subsequently in march 2017 the uk invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty which provides a twoyear time period through march 2019 for the uk and the remaining eu countries to negotiate a withdrawal agreement the future effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent and the uncertainty around the terms upon which the uk will leave the eu it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications brexit would have and how such withdrawal would affect our company we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside the us including 17 from eu countries the consequences of brexit together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of brexit could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets including volatility in foreign currencies and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate although we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of brexit adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations operating results and financial condition all of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the eu 



if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team in light of the specialized and technical nature of our business our performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

some of our employees are unionized represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 5400  employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures approximately 35 of these employees are represented by unions or works councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our financial condition 

our required capital expenditures can be complex may experience delays or other difficulties and the costs may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment or facilities or substantial investments in new or expanded equipment and facilities execution of these capital expenditures can be complex and commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital 



expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including crossdefaults to other debt facilities see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen chinese renminbi south korean won australian dollar chilean peso and taiwan dollar exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 34  of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the united states 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities we have provided deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations in january 2018 we repatriated approximately 600 million of cash associated with earnings that were previously asserted to be indefinitely reinvested to fund our investment program these repatriations do not change our assertion on the remaining foreign earnings that are deemed indefinitely reinvested 



our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” project on base erosion and profit shifting and the enacted us tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” during the fourth quarter of 2017 may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to rockwood’s periods prior to its acquisition by us these indemnity obligations will continue generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity our earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the applicable tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings which may be material in the future the outcome of proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables 

legal and regulatory proceedings whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other resources inhibit our ability to sell our products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and otherwise negatively affect our business 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business 



considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us uk germany belgium and japan we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 79 million of required cash contributions during 2018  for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2018  may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs and support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 





we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants in addition the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences and risks for us including 

 if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition

legal proceedings

we are involved in litigation incidental to our business and are a party to a number of legal actions and claims various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits including but not limited to those related to environmental and hazardous material exposure matters product liability and breach of contract some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty considering among other things the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 



following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business to the us doj and sec and intend to cooperate with the doj and sec in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with any investigations by the doj or sec we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj or sec or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations however could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items however could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in that particular period

the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” on page 49 

overview 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that are designed to meet our customers’ needs across a diverse range of end markets the end markets we serve include energy storage petroleum refining consumer electronics construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection and custom chemistry services we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible lowcost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements among other factors position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment 



2017 highlights 



outlook 

the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve in particular the market for lithium battery and energy storage continues to accelerate providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity the other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage changing global conditions such as slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility crude oil price fluctuation a dynamic pricing environment and an everchanging landscape in electronics the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders we believe that our businesses remain wellpositioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets 

in 2017 our operations were managed and reported under three reportable segments lithium and advanced materials bromine specialties and refining solutions financial results and discussion about our segments included in this annual report on form 10k are organized according to these categories except where noted 

lithium and advanced materials we expect continued strong year over year growth for the remainder of 2018 in lithium led by continued strong demand in batterygrade applications price improvement and increased conversion capacity in 2017 pcs experienced weaker profitability due to pricing pressure and the impact of hurricane harvey partially offset by 



productivity and cost savings initiatives we expect pcs profitability to stabilize in 2018 due to productivity gains and increased volumes due to market demand offset by unfavorable pricing due to excess supply 

on a longer term basis we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new applications for lithium power continue to be developed and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles escalates against a favorable backdrop of steadily declining electric battery costs increasing electric battery performance and constructive global public policy toward acceptance of emobilityrenewables our longterm outlook is also bolstered by our successful negotiation of longterm supply agreements with a number of strategic customers reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner due to our scale access to geographically diverse low cost resources and longterm execution track record in pcs we expect growth in the organometallic business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending 

on december 14 2017 we signed a definitive agreement to sell the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of the pcs business to wr grace  co for proceeds of approximately 416 million in cash the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including approvals from regulatory authorities in addition during the first quarter of 2018 the pcs product category will merge with the refining solutions reportable segment to form a global business focused on catalysts and be reported in a separate reportable segment 

bromine specialties the bromine specialties business had a solid 2017 with strong volume growth in fire safety and other derivatives driving double digit earnings growth year over year we expect to see relatively flat growth on net sales and profitability in 2018 with sustained low oil prices we expect stable albeit low drilling completion fluid demand throughout the year while it is possible oil prices could rebound some in 2018 the shortterm impact will be to increase raw material costs offshore well completions lag oil pricing so any benefit in completion fluid volumes would likely extend into 2019 we are expecting relatively stable fire safety and other derivative net sales and profits in 2018 

on a longer term basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling we would expect this business to follow a longterm growth trajectory once oil prices recover from recent levels as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap could tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expands over time the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets 

refining solutions following a year of significant increases in the number of “hydro treating unit” catalyst changeouts and marked improvement in catalyst product mix our cft business performed as expected our fcc business also performed as expected despite impacts from hurricane harvey both businesses faced headwinds from rising raw material costs in 2017 and we expect that trend to continue in 2018 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels new refinery startups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our refining solutions business we believe delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world including those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields longer term we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio with superior technology and production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that refining solutions remains wellpositioned for the future 

all other the fine chemistry services business will continue to be reported outside the company’s reportable segments as it does not fit in the company’s core businesses we expect the next few years to be a challenge for fine chemistry services due to a challenging agriculture industry environment as well as customer order timing in pharmaceuticals 

corporate  we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate for 2018  to be between 23 and 24 however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions in december 2017 the tcja was signed into law in the us which among other things lowers the us 



corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 implementing a territorial tax system for nonus earnings and imposing a onetime transition tax on the undistributed earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries we also anticipate the potential for increased volatility in future effective tax rates from the continuing impact of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” 201609 which was adopted in the first quarter of 2017 

in the first quarter of 2018  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 0335  per share during 2017 we received and retired approximately 23 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program and the asr agreement and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis as approved by our share repurchase program 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2017  include an actuarial gain of 114 million   73 million  after income taxes as compared to a loss of 267 million   183 million  after income taxes from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016  

we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint additional information regarding our products markets and financial performance is provided at our web site wwwalbemarlecom  our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference 



results of operations 

the following data and discussion provides an analysis of certain significant factors affecting our results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 



 percentage calculation is not meaningful 



comparison of 2017  to 2016   

net sales 

for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded net sales of 307 billion  a 15   increase  compared to net sales of 268 billion  for the corresponding period of 2016 net sales increased due to 2722 million of higher volumes 1578 million of favorable pricing impacts and 34 million of favorable currency exchange impacts partially offset by the 386 million impact of the sale of the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2017  our gross profit increased   1394 million  or 14  compared to the corresponding period of 2016 included in cost of goods sold for the year ended december 31 2017 are 1 a 231 million  charge related to the markup of inventory purchased as part of the acquisition of the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion business of jiangli new materials 2 143 million  of acquisition and integration related costs resulting from the jiangli new materials acquisition and 3 restructuring costs of 29 million  related to a plan to reduce costs at several locations in addition gross profit decreased 31 million related to the divested mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business in the first quarter of 2016 excluding the impact of these items gross profit increased by 1828 million or 19 due primarily to higher overall sales volumes and favorable price impacts partially offset by increased costs in lithium and a 154 million negative impact from hurricane harvey overall these factors contributed to a gross profit margin for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  of 361  and 363  respectively excluding the impact of the charges noted above gross profit margin was 374 for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 367 for the year ended december 31 2016  

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2017  our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased   574 million  or 15  from the year ended december 31 2016  sga expenses for 2017 included approximately 100 million  of pension and opeb benefits including marktomarket actuarial gains of 88 million  allocated to sga expenses as compared to 293 million  of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses of 263 million  allocated to sga expenses in 2016 in addition the year ended december 31 2017  includes 196 million  of acquisition and integration related costs primarily resulting from the acquisition of jiangli new materials 84 million  of restructuring costs related to several locations primarily our lithium sites in germany and 33 million  of multiemployer plan financial improvement plan shortfall contributions for our employees excluding the impact of these charges and the marktomarket actuarial gains and losses sga expenses increased by 612 million or 17 primarily due to increased compensation costs lithium growth spending and professional fees partially offset by savings from our restructuring as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 143  in 2017  compared to 142  in 2016  excluding the impact of these charges and the marktomarket actuarial gains and losses sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 135 in 2017  and 132  in 2016  

the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2017 is primarily attributable to a higher return on pension plan assets in 2017 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us and foreign pension plan assets was 1431  versus an expected return of 673  the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate to 403  from 443  for our us pension plans and to 194  from 200  for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2017 measurement date 

the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate to 443  from 467  for our us pension plans and to 200  from 276  for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2016 measurement date the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2016 was partially offset by a higher return on pension plan assets in 2016 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us and foreign pension plan assets was 811  versus an expected return of 685

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2017   increased   502 million  to 1154 million  from the corresponding 2016  period due mainly to a loss of 528 million  on early extinguishment of debt related to the tender premiums fees unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the repayment of the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million  of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million  of the 450 senior notes 

other expenses income net 

other expenses income net for the year ended december 31 2017  was 256 million  versus 59 million  for the corresponding 2016  period during the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded a 287 million reserve recorded against a note receivable in one of our european entities no longer deemed probable of collection 32 million  of asset retirement obligation charges related to the revision of an estimate at a site formerly owned by albemarle losses of 41 million related to the final settlements of previously disposed businesses and the revision of tax indemnification expenses of 37 million  primarily related to the filing of tax returns and a competent authority agreement for a previously disposed business this is partially offset by a 106 million  gain related to the reversal of liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting from a previous acquisition a 62 million  gain related to the acquisition of the 50 interest of an equity investment and 11 million related to a reversal of a liability associated with the previous disposal of a property in 2017 the remaining change was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange losses of 135 million and a 29 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities recorded during the third quarter of 2016 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate for 2017  was 966  compared to 187  for 2016  our effective income tax rate for 2017 was primarily affected by the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 the tax effects of the tcja are recorded in connection with the onetime transition tax expense of 4292 million partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 of 623 million tax benefit exclusive of the enactment of the tcja the company’s effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of earnings from outside the us mainly attributable to our share of the income of our jbc joint venture a free zones company under the laws of the hashemite kingdom of jordan in addition income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 included foreign rate changes of 162 million and a 51 million outofperiod adjustment due to changes in our deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in chilean fixed assets offset by a 109 million benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to a foreign restructuring plan that was initiated during the second quarter of 2017 and a 88 million benefit from excess tax benefits realized from stockbased compensation arrangements

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 845 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 596 million  in the same period last year this increase  of 249 million  was primarily due to higher equity income reported by our lithium and advanced materials segment joint venture windfield holdings pty ltd resulting from favorable pricing and volumes in our lithium business 



income from discontinued operations net of tax 

the year ended december 31 2016 income from discontinued operations after income taxes of 2021 million  included a pretax gain of 3880 million   1350 million  after income taxes related to the sale of our chemetall surface treatment business which closed on december 14 2016 this gain represents the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and their fair value as determined by the sales price less estimated costs to sell and included the reversal of 814 million of foreign currency translation loss out of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2017  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 446 million  compared to 371 million  in the same period of 2016 this increase  of 75 million  was due primarily to changes in consolidated income related to our jbc joint venture resulting from higher sales volumes

net income attributable to albemarle corporation decreased  to 549 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 6437 million  for the corresponding period of 2016  the year ended december 31 2017 was negatively impacted by the onetime transition tax expense of 4292 million recorded as a result of the enactment of the tcja in december 2017 in addition the year ended december 31 2017 included a 528 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and 171 million of restructuring and other costs while the year ended december 31 2016 included net gains of 2505 million after income taxes related to the sale of businesses including discontinued operations excluding these items net income attributable to albemarle increased by 1608 million the increase was primarily due to the increase in gross profit from higher overall sales volumes and favorable price impacts the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 of 623 million tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the tcja and lower acquisition and integration related costs partially offset by an increase in sga expenses income before taxes from discontinued operations in 2016 and the negative impact of hurricane harvey 

other comprehensive income net of tax 

total other comprehensive income after income taxes was 1876 million  in 2017  compared to 83 million  in 2016  this change is primarily due to changes in foreign currency translations we translate our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to us dollars in 2017  other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation adjustments was 2274 million  mainly as a result of favorable movements in the european union euro of approximately 192 million the korean won of approximately 16 million the chinese renminbi of approximately 13 million and the taiwan dollar of approximately 4 million also included in total other comprehensive income for 2017  is a loss of 418 million  in connection with the revaluation of our eurobased 1875 senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations in 2016  other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was 208 million  mainly as a result of unfavorable movements in the british pound sterling of approximately 25 million the chinese renminbi of approximately 12 million the korean won of approximately 6 million the turkish lira of approximately 6 million partially offset by favorable movements in the european union euro of approximately 15 million and the brazilian real of approximately 13 million included in the currency movements for 2016 is the favorable effect of 814 million in accumulated foreign currency translation losses that were reversed as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business also included in total other comprehensive income for 2016  is income of 261 million  in connection with the revaluation of our eurobased 1875 senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations 

segment information overview  we have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions our reportable business segments consist of 1 lithium and advanced materials 2 bromine specialties and 3 refining solutions 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables the “all other” category comprises three operating segments that do not fit into any of our core businesses subsequent to the acquisition of rockwood mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals fine chemistry services and metal sulfides during 2016 we completed the sales of the metal sulfides business and the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business 

the corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporaterelated items not allocated to the reportable segments pension and opeb service cost which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the segments all other and corporate whereas the 



remaining components of pension and opeb benefits cost or credit “nonoperating pension and opeb items” are included in corporate segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs 

the company’s chief operating decision maker uses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as acquisition and integration related costs utilization of inventory markup gains or losses on sales of businesses restructuring charges facility divestiture charges nonoperating pension and opeb items and other significant nonrecurring items “adjusted ebitda” in a balanced manner and on a segment basis to assess the ongoing performance of the company’s business segments and to allocate resources in addition management uses adjusted ebitda for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performancebased compensation for management and other employees the company has reported adjusted ebitda because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables periodtoperiod comparability of financial performance adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is not required by or presented in accordance with us gaap adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss attributable to albemarle corporation the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with us gaap or any other financial measure reported in accordance with us gaap

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 



certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

property plant and equipment  we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from two  to sixty  years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our longterm mineral rights which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates market prices and tax rates among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes  we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions  

environmental remediation liabilities  we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management and the chief operating decision maker we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions about sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions income taxes working capital and other economic or marketrelated factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” 



approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2017  and concluded there was no impairment as of that date in addition no indications of impairment in any of our reporting units were indicated by the sensitivity analysis 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five  to twentyfive  years except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our lithium business which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

resource development expenses 

we incur costs in resource exploration evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects exploration costs incurred before obtaining legal rights to explore an area are generally expensed as incurred after obtaining legal rights exploration costs are expensed in areas where we have uncertainty about obtaining proven resources in areas where we have substantial knowledge about the area and consider it probable to obtain commercially viable proven resources exploration and evaluation costs can be capitalized 

if technical feasibility studies have been obtained resource evaluation expenses are capitalized when the study demonstrates proven or probable resources for which future economic returns are expected while costs for projects that are not considered viable are expensed development costs that are necessary to bring the property to commercial production or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred 

capitalized resource costs are depleted using the unitsofproduction method our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 





actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a monthly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2017  we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2017  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2017  measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2017  the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans was decreased to 403  and 194  respectively from 443  and 200  respectively at december 31 2016  to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2017  measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2017  and 2016  was 399  and 435  respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2017  and 2016  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 689  and the weightedaverage expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 616  and 666  respectively effective january 1 2018  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 689  and 552  respectively the weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 700  during 2017  and 2016  there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on opeb plan assets effective january 1 2018  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2017  and 2016 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 318  for our foreign pension plans 

in october 2016 the society of actuaries “soa” published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2016 the updated improvement scale incorporates three additional years of mortality data 2012 – 2014 and a modification of two other input values to improve the model’s yearoveryear stability we utilized the same base mortality soa rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the mp2016 mortality improvement scale for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2016 in october 2017 the soa published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2017 the updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data 2015 we utilized the same base soa rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the mp2017 mortality improvement scale for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2017 

at december 31 2017  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 



a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6607 million  total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2017  964 million  or approximately 15  are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2011 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2011 

         with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process we have audits ongoing for the years 2006 through 2015 related to germany taiwan canada italy india and france some of which are for entities that have since been divested 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within 



the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 16 million  as a result of closure of tax statutes as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business we agreed to indemnify certain income and nonincome tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions associated with the entities sold the associated liability is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities see note 16 “other noncurrent liabilities” and note 20 “income taxes” for further details 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries if it is determined that cash can be repatriated with little to no tax consequences we may choose to repatriate cash at that time the enactment of the tcja during the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and as a result all previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been accrued are now subject to us tax despite the us taxation of these amounts we intend to invest most or all of these earnings indefinitely outside the us and do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested we will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration the tcja the accounting is expected to be completed within the measurement period as allowed under staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs funding working capital acquisitions and repayment of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from divestitures and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 114 billion  at december 31 2017  as compared to 227 billion  at december 31 2016  cash provided by operating activities was 3040 million  7355 million  and 3608 million  during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to the 2017 payment of approximately 257 million of income taxes from the gain on sale of the chemetall surface treatment business that was recorded in income taxes payable in 2016 in addition the decrease resulted from the build up of inventory in the lithium and advanced materials reportable segment in 2017 this was partially offset by increased overall sales volumes and prices lower acquisition and integration related costs and lower interest payments in 2017 as compared to 2016 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to the increase in income taxes payable from the gain on sale of the chemetall surface treatment business increased overall sales volumes and prices lower fixed and variable costs lower acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the rockwood acquisition and lower payments for interest 



and taxes partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable from higher sales in certain regions with longer payment terms as compared to 2015 

during 2017  cash on hand cash provided by operations and net borrowings of 1388 million  funded 7782 million  of debt repayments 3177 million  of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment a 2500 million accelerated share repurchase program dividends to shareholders of 1406 million  and pension and postretirement contributions of 133 million  also during 2017  our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 1025 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 368 million  during 2016 cash on hand cash provided by operations and 333 billion of cash proceeds from divestitures funded 142 billion of debt repayments 1967 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1354 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 201 million also during 2016 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 105 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 359 million during 2015 cash on hand cash provided by operations a return of capital from an unconsolidated investment and proceeds from borrowings funded 21 billion for acquisitions 2276 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1193 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 216 million also during 2015 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 70 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 233 million 

on december 14 2017 we signed a definitive agreement to sell the polyolefin catalysts and components portion of our pcs business to wr grace  co for proceeds of approximately 416 million in cash the transaction includes albemarle’s product development center located in baton rouge louisiana and operations at our yeosu south korea site the sale does not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the pcs business the sale of the polyolefin catalysts business and components reflects our commitment to investing in the future growth of our high priority businesses and returning capital to shareholders the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including approvals from regulatory authorities the assets and liabilities of this business are included in assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale respectively in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 

on december 14 2016 we completed the previously announced sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion net of purchase price adjustments as a result of the sale we recorded a gain of 3880 million  before income taxes and a tax liability of 2530 million related to the difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests sold in 2016 we used the proceeds to significantly reduce leverage including repaying the outstanding balance of the september 2015 term loan in full and approximately 153 million of commercial paper notes in december 2016 in addition during the first quarter of 2017 we repaid the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million  of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million  of the 450 senior notes as well as related redemption premiums of 452 million  we intend to use the remaining proceeds to invest heavily in the growth of the remaining businesses and return capital to shareholders 

in 2016 we completed the sales of our metal sulfides business and our mineralbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses for net proceeds of approximately 137 million and 187 million respectively the net proceeds from both sales were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the september 2015 term loan agreement 

capital expenditures were 3177 million  1967 million  and 2276 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment the increase in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2017 primarily relates to the lithium plant expansion projects in chile capital expenditures for discontinued operations were 193 million  and 237 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 800 to 900 million  in 2018  for lithium growth and capacity increases productivity and continuity of operations projects of the total capital expenditures our projects related to the continuity of operations is expected to remain in the range of 46 of net sales similar to prior years 

during 2017 we incurred 339 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects including the jiangli new materials acquisition which contains unusual compensation related costs negotiated specifically as a result of this acquisition that are outside of the company’s ordinary compensation arrangements during 2016 we incurred 521 million  of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood mainly consisting of professional services costs to achieve synergies relocation costs and other integration costs and 53 million  of costs in connection with other significant projects in 2015 we incurred 1239 million  of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood mainly consisting of professional services and advisory fees costs to achieve synergies relocation costs and other integration costs and 84 million  of costs in connection with other significant projects 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under our share repurchase program pursuant to which the company was permitted to repurchase up to a maximum 



of 15000000  shares including those previously authorized but not yet repurchased under our existing board authorized share repurchase program the company entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution on march 1 2017 under the asr agreement in march 2017 the company paid 250 million  from available cash on hand and received and retired an initial delivery of 1948178  shares of our common stock under the terms of the asr agreement on june 16 2017 the transaction was completed and we received a final settlement of 392905  shares calculated based on the daily rule 10b18 volumeweighted average prices of the company’s common stock over the term of the asr agreement less an agreed discount in total we received and retired 2341083  shares under the asr agreement which reduced the company’s weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 there were 12658917  remaining shares available for repurchase under the company’s authorized share repurchase program there were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2016 or 2015 

net current assets decreased to approximately 128 billion  at december 31 2017  from 217 billion  at december 31 2016  with the decrease being largely due to the reduction in cash used to repay a portion of the senior notes and to fund the accelerated share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2017 other changes in the components of net current assets are due to the timing of the sale of goods and other normal transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the normal course of business 

on february 23 2018  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 0335  per share a 5  increase from the quarterly rate of 032  per share paid in 2017 

at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents included 110 billion  and 8464 million  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we repatriated approximately 205 million  537 million  and 1225 million  of cash associated with earnings respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities in january 2018 we repatriated approximately 600 million of cash associated with earnings that were previously asserted to be indefinitely reinvested to fund our investment program during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded an income tax benefit of 97 million related to previously taxed foreign earnings that we expect to repatriate within the foreseeable future these repatriations do not change our assertion on the remaining foreign earnings that are deemed indefinitely reinvested 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have the following senior notes outstanding 



our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before its maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest 



accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures the senior notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default 

our revolving unsecured credit agreement dated as of february 7 2014 as amended the “february 2014 credit agreement” currently provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion and matures on february 7 2020 borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1000 to 1700 depending on the company’s credit rating from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” moody’s investors services “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” the applicable margin on the facility was 110 as of december 31 2017 there were no borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement as of december 31 2017 

borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” or “adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter b with the exception of certain liens as specified in the agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the february 2014 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and c with the exception of certain indebtedness as specified in the agreement subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company our february 2014 credit agreement is available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 10 billion current maximum amount available under the february 2014 credit agreement the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2017  we had 4213 million  of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 18  and a weightedaverage maturity of 36 days  the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 142 billion  at december 31 2017  compared to 212 billion  at december 31 2016  the decrease is attributable to the repayment of a portion of the senior notes with the proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in addition at december 31 2017  we had the ability to borrow 5787 million  under our commercial paper program and the february 2014 credit agreement and 2501 million  under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our february 2014 credit agreement we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2017  we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 635 million  at december 31 2017  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 



other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2017  in thousands 



 amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” are expected to approximate 13 million  in 2018  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 109 million  to our domestic and foreign pension plans for continuing operations both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2017  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 244 million  and 279 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 146 million  and 151 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make acquisitions make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future our main focus over the next three years in terms of uses of cash will be investing in growth of the businesses and the return of value to shareholders additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing 



costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before 2020 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our refining solutions business we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the company’s code of conduct the fcpa and other potentially applicable laws based on this internal investigation we have voluntarily selfreported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our refining solutions business to the us doj and sec and intend to cooperate with the doj and sec in their review of these matters in connection with our internal investigation we have implemented and are continuing to implement appropriate remedial measures 

at this time we are unable to predict the duration scope result or related costs associated with any investigations by the doj or sec we also are unable to predict what if any action may be taken by the doj or sec or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations however could result in the imposition of fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses we do not believe however that any fines penalties disgorgement equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 114 billion  as of december 31 2017  of which 110 billion  is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access in january 2018 we repatriated approximately 600 million of cash associated with earnings that were previously asserted to be indefinitely reinvested to fund our investment program all other cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 401 million  344 million  and 395 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2017  totaled approximately 398 million  an increase  of 49 million  from 349 million  at december 31 2016  see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 281 million  288 million  and 186 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen chinese renminbi south korean won australian dollar chilean peso and taiwan dollar in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged unless otherwise noted gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in other expenses income net and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2017  our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 3574 million  and with a fair value representing a net liability position of 50 million  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2017  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in an increase  of approximately 125 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in a decrease  of approximately 149 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2017  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded 



in accumulated other comprehensive loss in january 2017 we repaid €3070 million  of these senior notes using proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business this repayment did not impair the designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 4266 million  and 2864 million  outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively these borrowings represented 23  and 11  of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 178  and 135  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 18  basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 08 million  as of december 31 2017  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the objective of the lithium research and development effort was to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets research and development efforts are generally focused on both process development eg pilot plant for the recycling of lithium ion batteries as well as new product development eg for lithium ion battery applications pcs research efforts are focused on catalyst performance improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations as well as process improvements 

the focus of research in bromine specialties is divided among new and improved flame retardants and new uses for bromine and brominebased products fire safety solutions research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants 

our refining solutions research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products through hydrotreating catalyst technologies with regard to hou we focus our efforts on increasing the yield of olefins such as propylene and butylene and increasing the yield and quality of fuels made from more complex and less pure feedstock through the use of novel fcc technologies 



we incurred research and development expenses of 805 million  892 million  and 883 million  during 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2016  we owned approximately 2100  active patents and approximately 800  pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act “osha” we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2016  with an osha occupational injury and illness incident rate of 053  for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 060  in 2015  

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

in june 2016 modifications to the toxic substances control act “tsca” in the us were signed into law requiring chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the us as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged 



for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 53 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities we provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

over the last three years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries in addition we have pursued opportunities to divest businesses which do not fit our high priority business growth profile following is a summary of our acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures during recent years 



on december 14 2016 we completed the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion net of purchase price adjustments the chemetall surface treatment business was acquired on january 12 2015 as part of the acquisition of rockwood the chemetall surface treatment business is a leading global supplier of applied surface treatments and services for metal plastic and glass substrates in a wide range of industries and end markets this sale reflects our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses reducing leverage and returning capital to shareholders 

on december 31 2016 we completed the acquisition of the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of jiangxi jiangli new materials science and technology co ltd for a purchase price of approximately 145 million this includes manufacturing assets and supporting business functions located in both jiangxi and sichuan china focused on the production of batterygrade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide we believe this acquisition will enable us to supply premium lithium salts to an expanded global customer base while solidifying our leading position in the lithium industry 

on january 12 2015 we completed the acquisition of rockwood for a purchase price of approximately 57 billion with rockwood becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of albemarle through the acquisition of rockwood we became a leading integrated and low cost global producer of lithium and lithium compounds used in lithiumion batteries for electronic devices alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies meeting the significant growth in global demand for these products 

in 2015 our chemetall surface treatment business completed several acquisitions including 1 all remaining shares of its shanghai chemetall joint venture for a purchase price of 576 million 2 the aluminum finishing business of chemal gmbh  co kg “chemal gmbh” based in hamm germany for a purchase price of 22 million and 3 the remaining noncontrolling interests’ share of nanjing chemetall surface technologies co ltd for a purchase price of 48 million the ownership interests of each of these acquisitions were transferred to basf se in the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business on december 14 2016 

in 2015 we announced our intention to pursue strategic alternatives including divestitures related to certain businesses which include mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals fine chemistry services and metal sulfides on january 4 2016 we completed the sale of our metal sulfides business to treibacher industrie ag for net proceeds of approximately 137 million included in the transaction were sites in vienna and arnoldstein austria and tribotecc’s proprietary sulfide synthesis process on february 1 2016 we completed the sale of our mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business to huber engineered materials a division of jm huber corporation for net proceeds of approximately 187 million the transaction included albemarle’s martinswerk gmbh subsidiary and manufacturing facility located in bergheim germany and albemarle’s 50 ownership interest in magnifin magnesiaprodukte gmbh a jointventure with radex heraklith industriebeteiligung ag at breitenau austria in april 2016 the company concluded that it would discontinue efforts to sell the fine chemistry services business 

on september 1 2014 we closed the sale of our antioxidant ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets to si group inc and received net proceeds of 1047 million included in the transaction were albemarle’s manufacturing sites in orangeburg south carolina and jinshan china along with albemarle’s antioxidant product lines manufactured in ningbo china

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will be in part related to our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality in adequate amounts if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to do so or may be delayed in doing so there also is a risk that raising prices charged to our customers could result in a loss of sales volumes our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 

we compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry in addition our products are facing increasing competition from market participants in china competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could negatively affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

within the enduse markets in which we compete competition is intense substitute products also exist for many of our products therefore we face substantial risk that certain events such as new product development by our competitors changing 



customer needs production advances for competing products price changes in raw materials and products our failure to secure patents or the expiration of patents could result in declining demand for our products as our customers switch to substitute products or undertake manufacturing of such products on their own if we are unable to develop produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors our results of operations may materially suffer 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs or support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions we may also need to invest and spend more on research and development and marketing costs to strengthen existing customer relationships as well as attract new customers 

albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make false or unsubstantiated claims imply immoral or improper conduct or are otherwise disparaging to our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

downturns in our customers’ industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries which are cyclical in nature or which are subject to secular downturns historically cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing end markets as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development we will have to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be 



accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace if we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end markets on a competitive basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries or their enforcement may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise in addition our trade secrets and knowhow may be improperly obtained by other means such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result in addition the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results 



our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

furthermore our subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery prohibitions of the us and other countries and export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the united states 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals 



with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities we have provided deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays or rulings changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation recent developments including the european commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen chinese renminbi south korean won australian dollar and chilean peso exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 30  of our net sales were denominated in such currencies significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which our raw materials products and facilities are subject 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to operate our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing registrationapproval requirements transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed 



that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities including for example current and prior property owners or operators as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances such liabilities can be difficult to identify or quantify 

we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings which may be material in the future the outcome of proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables 

legal and regulatory proceedings whether with or without merit and associated internal investigations may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute defend or conduct divert management’s attention and other resources inhibit our ability to sell our products result in adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines and otherwise negatively affect our business 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters 

with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws 

we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change including regulating greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could have impacts on our operations in addition we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an 



international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect us 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1987 and the london amendment of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with critical uses allowed in the us on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available with methyl bromide scheduled to be completely phased out in 2017 

over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from the negative consequences of fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under reach which imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern as defined under reach are subject to an authorization process which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain see “regulation” in item 1 business on page 8 our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the reach regulations 

in june 2016 modifications to the tsca in the us were signed into law requiring chemicals to be assessed against a riskbased safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals including chemicals used or produced by us these initiatives include the voluntary childrens chemical evaluation program and high production volume chemical initiative in the us as well as new initiatives in asia and other regions these assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production handling labeling or use of the subject chemicals such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our 



customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products such a decrease in demand would likely have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of disruptions or material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption casualty and other insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and coverage limits we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition 



for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel in addition because of our reliance on our senior management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization if we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 5000  employees including employees of our consolidated joint ventures certain of these employees are represented by unions or workers’ councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 





 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the united states united kingdom germany belgium and japan we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 60 million of required cash contributions during 2017  for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2017  may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the chemical facility antiterrorism standards program “cfats program” which is administered by the department of homeland security “dhs” identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the us in december 2014 the protecting and securing chemical facilities from terrorist attacks act of 2014 “cfats act” was enacted the cfats act reauthorizes the cfats program for four years dhs has released an interim final rule under the cfats program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for highrisk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest this rule establishes riskbased performance standards for the security of the uss chemical facilities it requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments which identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans which include measures that satisfy the identified riskbased performance standards we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that dhs may require 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 



we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including crossdefaults to other debt facilities see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 51 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants in addition the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes does not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

this additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences including 





 we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to rockwood’s preacquisition periods generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

we have not established proven or probable reserves through the completion of a feasibility study for the minerals that we produce 

we have not established proven or probable reserves as defined by the sec under industry guide 7 through the completion of a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study for any of the minerals that we produce since we commenced production without having established proven or probable reserves there may be greater inherent uncertainty as to whether or not mineralized material can be economically obtained as originally planned and anticipated also because we do not have any proven or probable reserves we may not be able to continue to produce such minerals at existing levels or to expand our production capacity in the future which could harm our business results or operations and financial condition 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the applicable tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations 

our required capital expenditures may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures for continuing operations generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment and substantial investments in new equipment commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected timing of sales of product from such facility construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete the project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products 



future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets

forwardlooking statements 

some of the information presented in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such forwardlooking statements are based on our current expectations which are in turn based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our current knowledge of our business and operations we have used words such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “may” “should” “would” “will” and variations of such words and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements 

these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control therefore there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include without limitation 





 we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forwardlooking statements should circumstances change except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k 

the following is a discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” on page 49 

overview 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that meets customer needs across an exceptionally diverse range of end markets the end markets we serve include the petroleum refining consumer electronics energy storage construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection food safety and custom chemistry services we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible lowcost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts ongoing productivity improvements position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment 

2016 highlights 







outlook 

the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve from slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility significantly low crude oil prices a dynamic pricing environment in bromine derivatives and an everchanging landscape in electronics to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers diverse energy storage needs including exciting opportunities in electric vehicles and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes significant deleveraging optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers we believe that our businesses remain positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to improved economic conditions additionally we achieved our goal regarding synergies from the acquisition of the rockwood businesses 

on december 14 2016 we completed the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion net of purchase price adjustments a portion of the proceeds have been used to reduce leverage while the remaining proceeds are expected to be used to invest in growth of the remaining businesses and to return capital to shareholders 

lithium and advanced materials we expect continued strong growth in 2017 led by demand in batterygrade applications and continued price improvement in lithium pcs experienced weaker profitability in 2016 due to weakness in the curatives market and the bankruptcy filing of one of our customers which resulted in a 10 million impact to income from continuing operations before income taxes and adjusted ebitda during the year while we expect further negative impacts from the bankruptcy filing in 2017 we expect pcs profitability to stabilize in 2017 due to productivity gains and increased volumes due to market demand offset slightly by unfavorable pricing due to excess supply 



on a longer term basis we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new applications for lithium power continue to be developed and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles escalates in addition we expect growth in pcs from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending particularly in asia and the middle east 

bromine specialties the bromine specialties business had a solid 2016 with the lack of the methyl bromide product net sales more than offset by volume growth in fire safety and other derivatives as well as lower variable costs we expect to see relatively flat growth on net sales and profitability in 2017 with sustained low oil prices we expect stable albeit low drilling completion fluid demand throughout the year while it is possible oil prices could rebound some in 2017 the shortterm impact will be to raw material cost offshore well completions lag oil pricing which would likely extend beyond 2017 we are expecting relatively stable fire safety and other derivative net sales and profits in 2017 

on a longer term basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling we would expect this business to follow a longterm growth trajectory once oil prices recover from recent levels as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap could tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expands over time the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets 

refining solutions following the downturn in 2015 primarily caused by cash preservation measures from oil companies triggered by oil price volatility in 2016 we saw a significant increase in the number of “hydro treating unit” catalyst changeouts and related catalyst demand in addition to catalyst demand increase we also saw a marked improvement in catalyst product mix year over year despite ongoing uncertainty of oil prices and the ensuing impact on crude slates used by refiners and resulting demand for catalysts we expect sustained performance in our clean fuels technology business driven by refining changeouts and balanced product mix we also expect solid performance from our heavy oil upgrading division despite a number of scheduled maintenance shutdowns and plant turnarounds at refiners which could dampen heavy oil upgrading demand in 2017 we also anticipate headwinds from rising raw material costs in 2017 following historically low prices in 2016 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels from a growing population and increasing mobility and the implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refining solutions business delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry and we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields longer term we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio with superior technology and production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that refining solutions remains wellpositioned for the future 

all other during the first quarter of 2016 we closed the previously announced sales of the metal sulfides business and the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business the cash generated from the sale of these businesses was used to reduce borrowings outstanding under the september 2015 term loan agreement in april 2016 we concluded that we would suspend efforts to sell the fine chemistry services business this business will continue to be reported outside the company’s reportable segments we expect the next few years to be a challenging for fine chemistry services due to a challenging agriculture industry environment as well as customer order timing in pharmaceuticals 

corporate  in the first quarter of 2017  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 032  per share we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate for 2017  to be approximately 220  however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the united states and other tax jurisdictions

 lithium and advanced materials 

lithium and advanced materials segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 8346 million  up 5218 million  or 167   in comparison to the same period in 2014  the increase was driven mainly by the acquisition of rockwood and 260 million of favorable pcs volumes due to higher demand partially offset by 74 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro adjusted ebitda for lithium and advanced materials was up 283  or 2313 million  to 3129 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  with approximately 2135 million due to the acquisition of rockwood and 246 million in higher pcs sales 



volumes due to strong demand partially offset by 36 million of unfavorable impacts of currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro 

bromine specialties 

bromine specialties segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 7757 million  a decrease of 331 million  or 4   in comparison to the same period in 2014  the decrease was driven mainly by 218 million of unfavorable volumes on weaker demand and 205 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by 94 million of favorable price impacts on certain products adjusted ebitda for bromine specialties decreased 1  or 23 million  to 2227 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  with approximately 125 million of unfavorable impacts of currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by 94 million in favorable pricing impacts due to market conditions 

refining solutions 

refining solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 7293 million  a decrease of 1229 million  or 14  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  this decrease was predominantly due to 1035 million of unfavorable clean fuels technology volumes due to customer demand 150 million unfavorable clean fuels technology and heavy oil upgrading pricing impacts due to product and customer mix and 304 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by 304 million of higher heavy oil upgrading volumes refining solutions adjusted ebitda decreased 23  or 589 million  to 1976 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  in comparison to the corresponding period of 2014  this decrease was due primarily to lower overall sales volumes primarily in clean fuels technology due to lower demand unfavorable pricing and mix due to economic conditions and specific crude feeds and unfavorable impacts of currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by 217 million in favorable pricing on raw materials and natural gas 

all other 

all other net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 4714 million  a decrease of 03 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the decrease was driven mainly by 553 million of unfavorable fine chemistry services volumes and 294 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation impacts primarily due to the weaker european union euro offset by the acquisition of rockwood all other adjusted ebitda was down 27  or 200 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  in comparison to the same period of 2014  this decrease was due primarily to lower overall sales and unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by the acquisition of rockwood 

corporate 

corporate adjusted ebitda was a charge of 311 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  a decrease of 438 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the change was due mainly to 527 million of foreign currency translation gains and achieved synergies partially offset by the acquisition of rockwood the foreign translation gains are primarily related to cash denominated in us dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the european union euro serves as the functional currency 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

property plant and equipment  we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from two  to sixty  years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our longterm mineral rights which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use 



and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates market prices and tax rates among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes  we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions  

environmental remediation liabilities  we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions about sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions income taxes working capital and other economic or marketrelated factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2016  and concluded there was no impairment as of that date in addition no indications of impairment in any of our reporting units were indicated by the sensitivity analysis 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is 



necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five  to twentyfive  years except for customer lists and relationships associated with our lithium business which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a monthly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2016  we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2016  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2016  measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2016  the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans was decreased to 443  and 200  respectively from 467  and 276  respectively at december 31 2015  to reflect market conditions as of 



the december 31 2016  measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2016  and 2015  was 435  and 459  respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2016  and 2015  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 689  and 688  respectively and the weightedaverage expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 666  and 576  respectively effective january 1 2017  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 689  and 616  respectively the weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 700  during 2016  and 2015  there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on opeb plan assets effective january 1 2017  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2016  the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 318  from 316  for our foreign pension plans 

in october 2015 the society of actuaries “soa” published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2015 the updated improvement scale incorporated two additional years of mortality data and reflected a trend toward somewhat smaller improvements in longevity in addition the soa released a set of factors to adjust the rp2014 mortality tables to base year 2006 we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate these updated mortality improvements for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2015 in october 2016 the soa published an updated mortality improvement scale mp2016 the updated improvement scale incorporates three additional years of mortality data 2012 – 2014 and a modification of two other input values to improve the model’s yearoveryear stability we utilized the same base mortality soa rp2014 adjusted to 2006 total dataset mortality but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the mp2016 mortality improvement scale for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2016 

at december 31 2016  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6092 million  total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2016  861 million  or approximately   14  are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance 



deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2013 in 2016 the irs finalized its audit of legacy albemarle’s us consolidated group for 2011 and 2012 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2010 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process during 2016 the german tax authorities continued and announced audits on multiple german subsidiaries that have since divested for various years from 2006 through 2015 also during 2016 audits of our japanese taiwan singapore and netherlands subsidiaries were closed with no issue in addition we have various audits ongoing for the years 2007 through 2014 related to canada russia india and italy all of which are entities that have since been divested 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 32 million  as a result of closure of tax statutes as a result of the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business we agreed to indemnify certain income and nonincome tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions associated with the entities sold the associated liability is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities see note 16 “other noncurrent liabilities” and note 20 “income taxes” for further details 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries if it is determined that cash can be repatriated with little to no tax consequences we may choose to repatriate cash at that time our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 



financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments funding working capital acquisitions and repayment of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from divestitures and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 227 billion  at december 31 2016  as compared to 2137 million  at december 31 2015  cash provided by operating activities was 7334 million  3607 million  and 4926 million  during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to increased overall sales volumes and prices lower fixed and variable costs lower acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the rockwood acquisition and lower payments for interest and taxes partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable from higher sales in certain regions with longer payment terms as compared to 2015 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily due to higher acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the rockwood acquisition higher payments for interest and higher payments for income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 

during 2016  cash on hand cash provided by operations and 333 billion  of cash proceeds from divestitures funded 142 billion  of debt repayments 1967 million  of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1354 million  and pension and postretirement contributions of 201 million  also during 2016  our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 105 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 359 million  during 2015 cash on hand cash provided by operations a return of capital from an unconsolidated investment and proceeds from borrowings funded 21 billion for acquisitions 2276 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1193 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 216 million also during 2015 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 70 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 233 million during 2014 cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from divestitures funded payments of 1500 million for repurchases of our common stock 1106 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 841 million 334 million for the settlement of a forward starting interest rate swap debt financing costs of 176 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 139 million also during 2014 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 51 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 155 million additionally in 2014 we issued a series of new senior notes totaling approximately 19 billion 

on december 14 2016 we completed the previously announced sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion net of purchase price adjustments as a result of the sale we have recorded a gain of 3880 million  before income taxes and a tax liability of 2530 million related to the difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests sold we have used the proceeds to significantly reduce leverage including repaying the outstanding balance of the september 2015 term loan agreement in full and approximately 153 million of commercial paper notes in december 2016 in addition through february 2017 we repaid the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million  of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million  of the 450 senior notes as well as related redemption premiums of 452 million  we intend to use the remaining proceeds to invest heavily in the growth of the remaining businesses and return capital to shareholders 

on january 4 2016 we closed the sale of our metal sulfides business to treibacher industrie ag included in the transaction were sites in vienna and arnoldstein austria and tribotecc’s proprietary sulfide syntheses process we received net proceeds of approximately 137 million which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the september 2015 term loan agreement and recorded a gain of 115 million before income taxes in 2016 related to the sale of this business 



on february 1 2016 we closed the sale of our mineralbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses to huber engineered materials a division of jm huber corporation the transaction included albemarle’s martinswerk gmbh subsidiary and manufacturing facility located in bergheim germany and albemarle’s 50 ownership interest in magnifin magnesiaprodukte gmbh a jointventure with radex heraklith industriebeteiligung ag at breitenau austria we received net proceeds of approximately 187 million which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the september 2015 term loan agreement and recorded a gain of 1123 million before income taxes in 2016 related to the sale of these businesses 

net current assets increased to approximately 217 billion  at december 31 2016  from 2143 million  at december 31 2015  with the increase being primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business sold in december 2016 partially offset by the divestiture of the related net current assets held for sale included in net current assets at december 31 2015 was 3123 million of assets held for sale net of related liabilities other changes in the components of net current assets are due to the timing of the sale of goods and other normal transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the normal course of business 

capital expenditures were 1967 million  2276 million  and 1106 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment capital expenditures for discontinued operations were 193 million  and 237 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 375 million  in 2017  for lithium growth and capacity increases productivity and continuity of operations projects of the total capital expenditures our projects related to the continuity of operations is expected to remain in the range of 46 of net sales similar to prior years 

during 2016 we incurred 521 million  of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood mainly consisting of professional services costs to achieve synergies relocation costs and other integration costs and 53 million  of costs in connection with other significant projects in 2015 we incurred 1239 million  of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood mainly consisting of professional services and advisory fees costs to achieve synergies relocation costs and other integration costs and 84 million  of costs in connection with other significant projects in 2014 we incurred 236 million of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood and 66 million of costs in connection with other significant projects 

during 2014 we repurchased approximately 22 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of our board authorized share repurchase program all of the shares repurchased in 2014 were also repurchased pursuant to the terms of accelerated share repurchase agreements with major financial institutions there were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2015 or 2016 in november 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under our share repurchase program pursuant to which the company is now permitted to repurchase up to a maximum of 15000000  shares including those previously authorized but not yet repurchased 

on february 23 2017  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 032  per share a 5  increase from the quarterly rate of 0305  per share paid in 2016 

at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents included 8464 million  and 2007 million  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we repatriated approximately 537 million  1225 million  and 100 million  of cash associated with earnings respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 



longterm debt 

as of february 20 2017 we have the following senior notes outstanding 



on december 14 2016 we completed the previously announced sale of the chemetall surface treatment business to basf se for cash proceeds of approximately 31 billion net of purchase price adjustments through february 2017 we used a portion of the proceeds to repay the 300 senior notes in full €3070 million  of the 1875 senior notes and 1747 million  of the 450 senior notes as well as related tender premiums of 452 million  

our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before its maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures the senior notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default 

upon completion of the rockwood acquisition we assumed rockwood’s senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 125 billion on october 15 2015 our whollyowned subsidiary rockwood specialties group inc redeemed all of the outstanding 4625 senior notes at a redemption price equal to 103469 of the principal amount of the notes representing a premium of 433 million plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the guarantees of the 4625 senior notes and the senior notes we issued in 2014 were released upon repayment of the 4625 senior notes 

the 4625 senior notes we assumed from rockwood were repaid with proceeds from a new term loan agreement we entered into on september 14 2015 the “september 2015 term loan agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na the “administrative agent” and certain other lenders the september 2015 term loan agreement provided for borrowings under a 364day term loan facility the “364day facility” and a fiveyear term loan facility the “fiveyear facility” or collectively the “term loan facilities” during the year ended december 31 2016 the company repaid the 364day facility and fiveyear facility in full primarily with proceeds from the sales of the chemetall surface treatment business the metal sulfides business and the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business the interest rate on both term loan facilities was libor plus 1375  

our revolving unsecured credit agreement dated as of february 7 2014 as amended the “february 2014 credit agreement” currently provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion and matures on february 7 2020 borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1000 to 1700 depending on the company’s credit rating from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” moody’s investors services “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” the applicable margin on the facility was 1300 as of december 31 2016 there were no borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement as of december 31 2016 

borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” or “adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter b with the exception of certain liens as specified in the agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the february 2014 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and c with the exception of certain indebtedness as specified in 



the agreement subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company our february 2014 credit agreement is available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 10 billion current maximum amount available under the february 2014 credit agreement the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business we repaid approximately 153 million  of commercial paper notes in december 2016 at december 31 2016  we had 2475 million  of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 146  and a weightedaverage maturity of 37 days  the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 212 billion  at december 31 2016  compared to 314 billion  at december 31 2015  the decrease is attributable to the term loan repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business in december 2016 in addition at december 31 2016  we had the ability to borrow 7525 million  under our commercial paper program and the february 2014 credit agreement and 2210 million  under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our february 2014 credit agreement we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2016  we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 513 million  at december 31 2016  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2016  in thousands 







7437 million of senior notes using the proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business as a result of the repayments interest payments will be reduced by approximately 21 million annually 

 amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” are expected to approximate 10 million  in 2017  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 122 million  to our domestic and foreign pension plans for continuing operations both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2016  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 279 million  and 1017 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 151 million  and 509 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make acquisitions make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future our main focus over the next three years in terms of uses of cash will be investing in growth of the businesses and the return of value to shareholders additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before 2020 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 23 billion  as of december 31 2016  of which 8464 million  is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 



among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 344 million  395 million  and 357 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2016  totaled approximately 349 million  an increase  of 35 million  from 314 million  at december 31 2015  see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 288 million  186 million  and 152 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen chinese renminbi south korean won australian dollar and chilean peso in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged unless otherwise noted gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 



at december 31 2016  our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consisted of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 2516 million  and with a fair value representing a net liability position of 02 million  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2016  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease  of approximately 79 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase  of approximately 60 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2016  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in january 2017 we repaid €3070 million  of these senior notes using proceeds from the sale of the chemetall surface treatment business this repayment did not impair the designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 2864 million  and 17 billion  outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively these borrowings represented 11  and 44  of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 135  and 151  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 13  basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 04 million  as of december 31 2016  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

performance chemicals segment 

as of december 31 2015 our performance chemicals segment consisted of three product categories lithium performance catalyst solutions and bromine 

lithium  our lithium business develops advanced materials for a wide range of industries and end markets we believe that our lithium business is a lowcost producer of the most diverse product portfolio of lithium derivatives in the industry 

we develop and manufacture a broad range of basic lithium compounds including lithium carbonate lithium hydroxide lithium chloride and valueadded lithium specialties and reagents including butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride lithium is a key component in products and processes used in a variety of applications and industries which include lithium batteries used in consumer electronics and automobiles high performance greases thermoplastic elastomers for car tires rubber soles and plastic bottles catalysts for chemical reactions organic synthesis processes in the areas of steroid chemistry and vitamins various life science applications as well as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry among other applications we also develop and manufacture cesium products for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and zirconium barium and titanium products for various pyrotechnical applications including airbag igniters 



in addition to developing and supplying lithium compounds we provide technical services including the handling and use of reactive lithium products we also offer our customers recycling services for lithium containing byproducts resulting from synthesis with organolithium products lithium metal and other reagents we plan to continue to focus on the development of new products and applications 

lithium — customers 

our most significant customers include panasonic corporation syngenta ag umicore sa samsung sdi co ltd and royal dsm nv 

lithium — competition 

the global lithium market consists of producers located in the americas asiapacific and to a lesser extent africa we believe that we are a leading global provider of lithium compounds major competitors include fmc corporation sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa sichuantianqi lithium and jiangxi ganfeng lithium competition in this part of the business is based on product quality reliability of supply and customer service in the metalbased specialty chemicals business key competitors include cabot corporation and sigmaaldrich corporation competition in this part of the business is based on product quality and product diversity 

lithium — raw materials and significant supply contracts 

we obtain lithium through solar evaporation of our ponds at the salar de atacama in chile and in silver peak nevada after we obtain the lithium brine from the salar de atacama we process it into lithium carbonate and lithium chloride at a plant in nearby la negra chile the lithium brine from our silver peak site is processed into lithium carbonate at our plant in silver peak subsequently in other locations in the united states “us” germany france and taiwan we further process the materials into various derivatives depending on the markets we serve 

our mineral rights with respect to the salar de atacama in chile consist exclusively of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to a longterm contract with the chilean government originally entered into in january 1975 by one of our predecessors and subsequently amended and restated our contract with the chilean government will remain in effect until the date on which we have produced and sold 200000 metric tons of lithium in any of its forms from the salar de atacama as of december 31 2015  the remaining amount of lithium we were permitted to sell under the contract equaled approximately 115000 metric tons of total lithium in february 2016 we announced that we were granted approval by the environmental assessment commission of the antofagasta region to increase our currently authorized lithium brine removal rate in the salar de atacama the size of the area at the salar de atacama covered by our claims is approximately 16700 hectares we currently own the land on which we operate our facility at the salar de atacama and our processing facility in la negra however the ownership of the land at the salar de atacama will revert to the chilean government once we have sold all amounts of lithium remaining under our contract with the chilean government the ownership of the land and fixed assets in la negra will remain unchanged in february 2016 we also announced that we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the chilean government that provides sufficient lithium to support the production of 70000 metric tons annually of technical and battery grade lithium carbonate and 6000 metric tons annually of lithium chloride in la negra over a 27year period beginning january 1 2017 

our mineral rights in silver peak nevada consist exclusively of our right to access lithium brine pursuant to a settlement agreement with the us government originally entered into in june 1991 by one of our predecessors pursuant to this agreement we have rights to all of the lithium that we can remove economically we or our predecessors have been operating at the silver peak site since 1966 our silver peak site covers a surface of approximately 15301 acres 10826 acres of which we own through a subsidiary the remaining acres are owned by the us government from whom we lease the land pursuant to a lease agreement which is renewed annually based on our 2015 production levels we believe that the amount of lithium brine we can economically obtain from our silver peak nevada site pursuant to our contract with the us government could support the current levels of lithium carbonate production for approximately 20 years assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied our annual lithium carbonate production capacity is estimated to be approximately 6000 metric tons at our silver peak facility however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium carbonate at either silver peak or la negra will be realized 

we also own a 49 interest in windfield holdings pty ltd which directly owns 100 of the equity of talison lithium pty ltd a company incorporated in australia “talison” talison through its whollyowned subsidiaries owns and operates a lithium mine in greenbushes western australia and mines lithium ore which is then milled and processed to separate lithium concentrate from the rest of the ore talison currently sells the lithium concentrate to its shareholders talison has a leading position in two categories of lithium concentrates i technicalgrade lithium concentrates which have low iron content for use in the manufacture of glass ceramics and heatproof cookware and ii a highyielding chemicalgrade lithium concentrate 



which is used to produce lithium chemicals which form the basis for manufacture of lithiumion batteries for laptop computers mobile phones electric bicycles and electric vehicles assuming certain operating conditions are satisfied the annual lithium concentrate production capacity at the talison facility is estimated to be approximately 575000 metric tons however no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of production of lithium concentrate at talison will be realized 

performance catalyst solutions “pcs”  we have four product lines in our pcs division polymer catalysts curatives organometallics and electronic materials we manufacture organometallic cocatalysts eg aluminum magnesium and zinc alkyls as well as metallocene components and cocatalysts eg methylaluminumoxane organoborons metallocene compounds and finished polymerization catalysts comprising these products we also offer finished singlesite catalysts with or without our proprietary activcat ®  activation technology and a line of proprietary zieglernatta catalysts under the advantage ™  brand our cocatalysts and finished catalysts are used in our customers’ production of polyolefin polymers such polymers are commodity ie zieglernatta polymerization technologybased and specialty ie single site polymerization technologybased plastics serving a wide variety of end markets including packaging nonpackaging films and injection molding some of our organometallic products are also used in the manufacture of alphaolefins ie hexene octene decene in electronic materials we manufacture and sell high purity metal organic products into electronic applications such as the production of lightemitting diodes “leds” for displays and general lighting as well as other products used in the production of solar cells our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes epoxies and other engineered resins

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2015  we owned approximately 3000  active and approximately 1500  pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2015  with an occupational injury and illness rate of 060  for albemarle employees and nested contractors compared to 0327  in 2014  

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern—such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic “cmrs” persistent 



bioaccumulative and toxic “pbts” very persistent very bioaccumulative “vpvb” and endocrine disruptors—will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 

historically there has been scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict 



environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 53 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities the company seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global or regional economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers suppliers and other business partners declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers and other business partners may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us also it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of those business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases if the current weakness in much of the global economy continues or deepens significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our inability to secure key raw materials or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

the longterm profitability of our operations will be in part related to our ability to continue to economically obtain resources including energy and raw materials for example our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce or otherwise obtain lithium and bromine of sufficient quality in adequate amounts to support our operations if we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase 



significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in the pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources in addition our products are facing increasing competition from market participants in china these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

within the enduse markets in which we compete competition between products is intense substitute products also exist for many of our products therefore we face substantial risk that certain events such as new product development by our competitors changing customer needs production advances for competing products price changes in raw materials and products our failure to secure patents or the expiration of patents could result in declining demand for our products as our customers switch to substitute products or undertake manufacturing of such products on their own if we are unable to develop produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors our results of operations may materially suffer 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs or support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions we may also need to invest and spend more on research and development and marketing costs to strengthen existing customer relationships as well as attract new customers our indebtedness could limit our flexibility to react to these industry trends and our ability to remain competitive 

albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make false or unsubstantiated claims implies immoral or improper conduct or is otherwise disparaging to our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which 



may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

our industries and the enduse markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key enduse markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing enduse markets we will have to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval if we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our enduse markets on a competitive basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material 



adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 14 



 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

furthermore our subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery prohibitions of the us and other countries and export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

changes in or the interpretation of tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results 

our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world currently the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the us and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the us if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we believe we will be able to access such funds in a tax efficient manner to satisfy cash flow needs 

we have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most nonus subsidiaries because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities currently there are no contemplated cash distributions that will result in incremental us taxes payable in excess of applicable foreign tax credits related to such undistributed earnings as a result we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the portion of undistributed foreign earnings determined not to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates expirations of tax holidays changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation we are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes it is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen singapore dollar chinese renminbi australian dollar chilean peso and the british pound sterling exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 42  of our net sales were denominated in such currencies significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 



our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which our raw materials products and facilities are subject 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits that are subject to renewal due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to operate our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing the cost of registrationapproval requirements the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products as well as the costs of the storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have tended to become stricter over time such changes in environmental laws or their interpretation or the enactment of new environmental laws could result in materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters 

with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws 

we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 



contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change for example some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could have impacts on our operations in addition we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 an amendment was passed by the unfcc during the december 2012 doha climate change talks that would implement a second commitment period through 2020 as of february 11 2016 60 countries have ratified the 2012 amendments in december 2015 the 21st conference of parties for the unfcc concluded with more than 190 countries adopting the paris agreement a partly binding and partly voluntary agreement to cut global carbon emissions in an effort to limit the rise in global temperatures the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect us 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from the negative consequences of fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 



we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could injure our employees or other persons damage our facilities or other properties interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

historically major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products our operations at the salar de atacama in chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we continually assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 



if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of february 1 2016 we had 6963  employees certain of these employees are represented by unions or works councils in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of albemarle and rockwood and therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

realization of the anticipated benefits in the merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses and operations of albemarle and rockwood we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating business practices operations and support functions 

our success after the merger will also depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees subsequent to the merger the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies’ operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial results financial condition or our stock price the integration process may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses there can be no assurance that the contemplated synergies anticipated from the merger will be realized or maintained if realized if the integration is not successful the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset the integration and restructuring costs over time 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

 19 



 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us united kingdom “uk” germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate approximately 80 million of required cash contributions during 2016  for our defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2016  may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity for example we have several pension plans located in germany belgium japan and the us our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 



we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our february 2014 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our february 2014 credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 50 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates could cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our february 2014 credit agreement our commercial paper program and our september 2015 term loan agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates under our february 2014 credit agreement and our september 2015 term loan agreement are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” moody’s investors services “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa3 and fitch has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb sp has rated our commercial paper as a3 moody’s has rated it as p3 and fitch has rated it as f3 sp moody’s andor fitch may downgrade our ratings in the future the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy in addition the indentures governing our senior notes does not limit our 



ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

as a result of the merger albemarle on a consolidated basis incurred substantial additional indebtedness and related debt service obligations this additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences including 

 we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to rockwood’s preacquisition periods generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire to the extent such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

we have not established proven or probable reserves through the completion of a feasibility study for the minerals that we produce 

we have not established proven or probable reserves as defined by the sec under industry guide 7 through the completion of a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study for any of the minerals that we produce furthermore we have no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of our projects since we commenced production without having established proven or probable reserves there may be greater inherent uncertainty as to whether or not mineralized material can be economically obtained as originally planned and anticipated also because we do not have any proven or probable reserves we may not be able to continue to produce such minerals at existing levels or to expand our production capacity in the future which could harm our business results or operations and financial condition 

future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and us deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

we evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for a valuation allowance based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

if our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we review our intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on october 31 of each year or more frequently if required factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the 



period in which any impairment of our goodwill intangible assets or longlived assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations 

our required capital expenditures may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures for continuing operations generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment and substantial investments in new equipment commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected timing of sales of product from such facility construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete the project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets

overview 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that meets customer needs across a diverse range of end markets the end markets we serve include petroleum refining consumer electronics energy storage construction automotive steel and aerospace lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection household appliances heating ventilation aluminum finishing food safety and custom chemistry services we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible lowcost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts ongoing productivity improvements and our recently completed acquisition of rockwood position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment 

2015 highlights

 outlook 

on october 26 2015 we announced that effective january 1 2016 performance chemicals will be split into two separate reportable segments 1 bromine specialties and 2 lithium and advanced materials which will include performance catalyst solutions and curatives each unit will have a dedicated team of sales product management research  development process technology manufacturing sourcing sales and operations planning and customer service groups and will have full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus agility and responsiveness we expect this change to provide further clarity into the performance of each business 



the current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve from slow and uneven global growth currency exchange volatility significantly lower crude oil prices a dynamic pricing environment in bromine derivatives and an everchanging landscape in electronics to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers diverse energy storage needs including exciting opportunities in electric vehicles and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes significant deleveraging following our acquisition of rockwood optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers we believe that our businesses remain positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to improved economic conditions additionally we are on track to exceed our original expectations regarding synergies from the acquisition of the rockwood businesses earlier in the year 

through 2015 our operations were managed and reported under three reportable segments performance chemicals refining solutions and chemetall surface treatment financial results and discussion about our segments included in this annual report on form 10k are organized according to these categories except where noted   

performance chemicals  we expect 2016 to be a challenging year for bromine sales and profitability growth due to an expected decline in demand of clear brine fluids used in offshore drilling projects as well as the expiration of a methyl bromide supply agreement at the end of 2015 that was not replaced through working capital discipline and strong controls on costs we expect to generate healthy cash flows in the bromine business despite these challenges 

for lithium and advanced materials we expect continued strong growth in 2016 led by demand in battery grade applications and continued price improvement in lithium performance catalyst solutions experienced strong growth in 2015 due market demand in general and due to certain competitor outages and we expect to maintain a similar level of profitability in 2016 

we believe that the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material inventory inflation will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets and with a more evenly sustained economic recovery 

on a longterm basis for bromine we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products demand for drilling completion fluids in 2015 held up better than expected but is likely to still be impacted negatively in the short term as a result of sustained lower oil prices impacting offshore drilling projects around the world longer term absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling we would expect this business to resume a solid growth trajectory once oil prices recover from recent levels as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap will tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expands over time 

on a longterm basis for lithium and advanced materials we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new applications for lithium power continue to be developed and the use of plugin hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles escalates in addition we expect growth in performance catalyst solutions to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending particularly in asia and the middle east 

refining solutions  2015 net sales were down 14 and adjusted ebitda was down 23 due largely to declines in clean fuels technology sales volumes slightly offset by solid growth in heavy oil upgrading volumes in 2016 despite some nearterm concerns about how the price of oil will impact the crude slate used by refineries and the resulting demand for catalysts we expect to see continued sustained high level performance from heavy oil upgrading as well as improvement in clean fuels technology results due to increased change outs by refiners and an improved product mix although certain national oil companies among others are expected to look for ways to delay catalysts change outs due to the current oil economic environment 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refining solutions business delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry and we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle 



east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields while lower oil prices may impact the overall crude slate for a period of time longer term we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour trends that bode well for catalysts demand given this and based on our technology current production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we believe that we remain wellpositioned for the future 

chemetall surface treatment  demand for surface treatment products generally follows the activity levels of metal processing manufacturers including the automotive steel and aerospace industries as well as products sold to general industrial markets including heavy equipment household appliances manufacturing heating ventilation and aluminum finishing we believe that our strong customer relationships service and our geographic and end market diversity coupled with the growth coming from recently completed acquisitions will lead to continued growth for 2016 

on a longer term basis we expect to continue to generate growth from our focus on new product development improving process technologies expanding our customer base and broadening our technology capabilities in existing and new markets through internal research and development and bolton acquisitions 

all other in 2015 we announced our intention to pursue strategic alternatives for several businesses mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals fine chemistry services and metal sulfides which together comprise the “all other” category we closed on the sale of the metal sulfides business on january 4 2016 and we closed on the sale of the mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals business on february 1 2016 

corporate  in the first quarter of 2016  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 0305  per share we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate for 2016  to be approximately 230  however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2015  include an actuarial gain of 389 million   278 million  after income taxes as compared to a loss of 1308 million   833 million  after income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014  

we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint additional information regarding our products markets and financial performance is provided at our web site wwwalbemarlecom  our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference 



results of operations 

the following data and discussion provides an analysis of certain significant factors affecting our results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 



 percentage calculation is not meaningful 



comparison of 2015  to 2014   

net sales 

for the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded net sales of 365 billion  a 49   increase  compared to net sales of 245 billion  for the corresponding period of 2014  approximately 14 billion of the increase  was attributable to the impact of the rockwood acquisition excluding the acquisition of rockwood net sales decreased by 2101 million primarily due to 1065 million of unfavorable sales volumes 877 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation and 158 million of unfavorable price impacts due to market conditions and portfolio mix the unfavorable sales volumes were due to lower clean fuels technologies fine chemistry services and bromine volumes partially offset by increased heavy oil upgrading and pcs sales volumes the unfavorable price impacts were primarily due to lower refining solutions fine chemistry services and pcs prices partly offset by favorable price impacts for bromine 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our gross profit increased   4260 million  or 55  from the corresponding 2014  period gross profit for 2015 includes 14 million  of pension and opeb benefits including marktomarket actuarial gains of 20 million  allocated to cost of good sold as compared to 365 million  of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses of 364 million  allocated to cost of goods sold in 2014 excluding the 379 million increase in gross profit related to pension and opeb plans gross profit increased by 3881 million due to 4709 million of gross profit attributable to the performance of the acquired rockwood business which includes a   759 million   charge for the utilization of the inventory markup recorded as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition partially offset by an 828 million decrease in gross profit due   primarily to unfavorable impacts from currency translation unfavorable price impacts due to market conditions and portfolio mix and lower overall sales volumes   overall these factors contributed to a higher  gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2015  of 328  up from 315  in the corresponding period of 2014  excluding the impact of pension and opeb marktomarket actuarial losses and gains our gross profit margin was 327  in 2015  and 330  in 2014  

the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2014 is primarily attributable to a a decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension plans to 403  from 500 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2014 measurement date and b changes in mortality assumptions and to a lesser extent other demographic assumptions related to our pension plans the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2014 was partially offset by a higher return on pension plan assets in 2014 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us pension plan assets was 887  versus an expected return of 691  

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased   1571 million  or 44  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  sga expenses for 2015 includes approximately 374 million  of pension and opeb benefits including marktomarket actuarial gains of 369 million  allocated to sga as compared to 971 million  of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses of 945 million  allocated to sga in 2014 excluding the 1345 million decrease in sga related to pension and opeb plans sga increased by 2916 million or 130 due to the acquisition of rockwood net of realized synergies as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 140  in 2015  compared to 145  in 2014  excluding the impact of pension and opeb marktomarket actuarial losses and gains sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 150  in 2015  and 107  in 2014  

the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2015 is primarily attributable to a an increase in the weightedaverage discount rate to 467  from 418  for our us pension plans and to 289  from 234  for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2015 measurement date and b changes in mortality assumptions the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2015 was partially offset by a lower return on pension plan assets in 2015 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us and foreign pension plan assets was 274  versus an expected return of 685  the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2014 resulted from the factors as discussed in gross profit  above 

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our rd expenses increased   146 million  or 16  from the year ended december 31 2014  primarily due to the acquisition of rockwood as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 28  in 2015  compared to 36  in 2014

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2015   increased   914 million  to 1327 million  from the corresponding 2014  period due mainly to higher borrowing levels in connection with the acquisition of rockwood included in 2015 is a charge of approximately 54 million related to the early extinguishment of the 4625 senior notes we assumed from rockwood 

other income expenses net 

other income expenses net for the year ended december 31 2015  was 485 million  versus 168 million  for the corresponding 2014  period the change was due mainly to 547 million of favorable foreign currency translation gains and a 123 million reduction in amortization of bridge facility fees and other financing fees related to the acquisition of rockwood the foreign currency gains are primarily related to cash denominated in us dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the european union euro serves as the functional currency 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate for 2015  was 81  compared to 87  for 2014  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods mainly due to the impact of earnings from outside the us including net impacts on the release of the liability from earnings that were not indefinitely invested and were repatriated from legacy rockwood our effective tax rate for 2015  was affected by discrete net tax benefit items of 416 million related mainly to the release of prior year uncertain tax positions associated with lapses in statutes of limitations and audit closures items associated with us provision to return adjustments and an opeb plan termination gain recorded in the period our effective income tax rate in 2014  was affected by tax benefits of 742 million related to restructuring charges a pension plan actuarial loss and the release of reserves related principally to the expiration of the us federal statute of limitations see note 20 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate for 2015  and 2014

by lower equity income reported by our refining solutions segment joint venture nippon ketjen company limited primarily due to lower sales volumes 

loss from discontinued operations 

loss from discontinued operations after income taxes of 695 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  includes a pretax charge of 855 million 657 million after income taxes related to the sale of our antioxidant ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets to si group inc which closed on september 1 2014 this charge represented the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and their fair value as determined by the sales price less estimated costs to sell and was primarily attributable to the writeoff of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets net of cumulative foreign currency translation gains of 178 million 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 252 million  compared to 276 million  in the same period last year this decrease  of 24 million  was due primarily to changes in consolidated income related to our jordanian joint venture

 performance chemicals 

performance chemicals segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 161 billion  up 4887 million  or 44  in comparison to the same period in 2014  the increase was driven mainly by the acquisition of rockwood 260 million of favorable pcs volumes due to higher demand and 94 million of favorable bromine price impacts on certain products partly offset by 218 million of unfavorable bromine volumes on weaker demand and 279 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro adjusted ebitda for performance chemicals was up 75  or 2289 million  to 5355 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  with approximately 2135 million due to the acquisition of rockwood 246 million in higher pcs sales volumes due to strong demand and 94 million in favorable bromine pricing impacts due to market conditions offset partly by 161 million of unfavorable impacts of currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro 



refining solutions 

refining solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 7293 million  a decrease of 1229 million  or 14  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  this decrease was predominantly due to 1035 million of unfavorable clean fuels technology volumes due to customer demand 150 million unfavorable clean fuels technology and heavy oil upgrading pricing impacts due to product and customer mix and 304 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by 304 million of higher heavy oil upgrading volumes refining solutions adjusted ebitda decreased 23  or 589 million  to 1976 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  in comparison to the corresponding period of 2014  this decrease was due primarily to lower overall sales volumes primarily in clean fuels technology due to lower demand unfavorable pricing and mix due to economic conditions and specific crude feeds and unfavorable impacts of currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by 217 million in favorable pricing on raw materials and natural gas 

chemetall surface treatment 

arising from the acquisition of rockwood chemetall surface treatment segment net sales and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2015  were 8249 million  and 2020 million  respectively

all other net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  were 4714 million  a decrease of 03 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the decrease was driven mainly by 553 million of unfavorable fine chemistry services volumes and 294 million of unfavorable impacts from currency translation impacts primarily due to the weaker european union euro offset by the acquisition of rockwood all other adjusted ebitda was down 27  or 200 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  in comparison to the same period of 2014  this decrease was due primarily to lower overall sales and unfavorable impacts from currency translation primarily due to the weaker european union euro partially offset by the acquisition of rockwood 

corporate 

corporate adjusted ebitda was a charge of 298 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  a decrease of 451 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the change was due mainly to 527 million of foreign currency translation gains and achieved synergies partially offset by the acquisition of rockwood the foreign translation gains are primarily related to cash denominated in us dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the european union euro serves as the functional currency 

comparison of 2014  to 2013 

net sales 

for the year ended december 31 2014  we recorded net sales of 245 billion  a 2   increase  compared to net sales of 239 billion  for the corresponding period of 2013  this increase  was due primarily to favorable volume impacts of approximately 601 million in refining solutions 113 million in minerals and 83 million in performance chemicals partially offset by unfavorable volume impacts of approximately 278 million in fine chemistry services and unfavorable currency impacts of approximately 22 million due to a stronger us dollar as we closed out the year 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our gross profit decreased   796 million  or 9  from the corresponding 2013  period our gross profit for 2014  was impacted by approximately 365 million  of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses of 364 million  allocated to cost of goods sold as compared to 422 million  of pension and opeb benefits including marktomarket actuarial gains of 427 million allocated to cost of goods sold in 2013  overall these factors contributed to our gross profit margin of 315  for 2014  down from 355  in 2013  excluding the impact of pension and opeb marktomarket actuarial losses and gains our gross profit margin was 330  in 2014  and 337  in 2013  

the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2014  is primarily attributable to a a decrease in the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension plans to 403  from 500 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2014  measurement date and b changes in mortality assumptions and to a lesser extent other demographic assumptions related to our pension plans the marktomarket actuarial loss in 2014 was partially offset by a higher return on pension plan assets in 2014 than was expected as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance the weightedaverage actual return on our us pension plan assets was 887  versus an expected return of 691  



the marktomarket actuarial gain in 2013  is primarily attributable to a an increase in the weightedaverage discount rate for our pension plans to 500 from 404 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2013 measurement date b the weightedaverage actual return on us pension plan assets of 1507 was higher than the expected return of 725 as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance and c changes in demographic assumptions related to our pension plans such as mortality rates rates of compensation and other factors 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our sga expenses increased   1969 million  or 125  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  this increase was primarily due to unfavorable pension and opeb items and incentive compensation costs sga expenses for 2014  includes approximately 971 million  of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses of 945 million  as compared to 905 million  of pension and opeb benefits including marktomarket actuarial gains of 963 million  in 2013  the marktomarket actuarial losses and gains in 2014  and 2013  respectively resulted from the factors as discussed in gross profit  above 

as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 145  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 66  for the corresponding period in 2013  excluding the impact of pension and opeb marktomarket actuarial losses and gains sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 107  in 2014  and 106  in 2013  

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our rd expenses increased   61 million  or 7  from the year ended december 31 2013  mainly as a result of higher personnel costs and higher spending for outside services as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 36  in 2014  compared to 34  in 2013  

restructuring and other net 

restructuring and other net of 259 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  includes the following items 

 in connection with a realignment of our operating segments effective january 1 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a workforce reduction plan which resulted in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide we recorded charges of 334 million 219 million after income taxes during the year ended december 31 2013 for termination benefits and other costs related to this workforce reduction plan 

acquisition and integration related costs 

the year ended december 31 2014  includes 236 million of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood and 66 million of costs in connection with other significant projects acquisitionrelated costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2013 are included in sga expenses and were not significant 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2014   increased   98 million  to 414 million  from the corresponding 2013  period due mainly to higher borrowing levels in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and decreases in interest capitalized on lower average construction work in progress balances in the 2014  period 

other expenses net 

other expenses net for the year ended december 31 2014  was 168 million  versus 67 million  for the corresponding 2013  period this increase was due to 167 million of amortized bridge facility fees and 10 million of other financing fees in the 2014 period related to the acquisition of rockwood partially offset by net favorable items of 76 million primarily related to favorable currency impacts compared to the corresponding period in 2013 due to more effective management of currency risks 



income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate for 2014  was 87  compared to 250  for 2013  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods mainly due to the impact of earnings from outside the us our effective income tax rate in 2014  was affected by tax benefits of 742 million related to restructuring charges a pension plan actuarial loss and the release of reserves related principally to the expiration of the us federal statute of limitations see note 20 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate for 2014  and 2013  

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 357 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 317 million  in the same period last year this increase  was due primarily to higher equity income reported by our refining solutions segment joint ventures nippon ketjen company limited and fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa our performance chemicals segment joint venture stannica and our magnifin joint venture included in all other partly offset by lower equity income amounts reported by our refining solutions segment joint venture eurecat 

loss income from discontinued operations 

loss income from discontinued operations after income taxes was 695 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 41 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  included in 2014  is a pretax charge of 855 million 657 million after income taxes which represented the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and their fair value as determined by the sales price less estimated costs to sell this charge was primarily attributable to the writeoff of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets net of cumulative foreign currency translation gains of 178 million 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2014  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 276 million  compared to 267 million  in the same period last year this increase  of 09 million  was due primarily to higher profits of our consolidated joint venture jbc in the 2014  period 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation decreased  to 1333 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 4132 million  for the corresponding period of 2013  primarily due to an unfavorable impact of 736 million  after income taxes related to discontinued operations unfavorable impacts of 2664 million  related to pension and opeb items mainly resulting from an actuarial loss in 2014 compared to an actuarial gain in 2013 charges of 302 million in 2014 for certain significant acquisitionrelated costs of which 236 million relates to the acquisition of rockwood higher manufacturing and sga costs of approximately 330 million higher interest and financing expenses of 98 million  and higher other expenses net of 101 million  partly offset by lower income tax expense of 1160 million  lower restructuring and other net of 74 million  favorable volume impacts of approximately 122 million on market demand and lower variable input costs of approximately 93 million 

other comprehensive loss income net of tax 

total other comprehensive loss income after income taxes was 1787 million  in 2014  compared to 313 million  in 2013  the majority of these amounts are the result of translating our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to us dollars in 2014  other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was 1688 million  mainly as a result of unfavorable movements of approximately 124 million in the european union euro 18 million in the chinese renminbi and 13 million in the brazilian real also included in total other comprehensive loss income for 2014 is 210 million  related to a realized loss on an interest rate swap which settled in the fourth quarter and 114 million  in connection with the revaluation of our €7000 million senior notes and settlement of related foreign currency forward contracts both of which were designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations in 2013  other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation adjustments was 317 million  mainly as a result of favorable movements in the european union euro of approximately 42 million partially offset by unfavorable movements in the brazilian real of approximately 14 million

performance chemicals 

performance chemicals segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2014  were 112 billion  down 202 million  or 2  in comparison to the same period in 2013  the decrease was due to lower bromine sales volumes of 285 million unfavorable bromine pricing of 166 million unfavorable pcs pricing of 87 million and 33 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts partially offset by 367 million of increased pcs sales volumes adjusted ebitda for performance chemicals was down 16  or 581 million  to 3066 million  for the year ended 2014  compared to 2013  as a result of lower pricing due to market conditions higher manufacturing and sga costs of approximately 220 million and unfavorable currency impacts of approximately 23 million mainly due to the weaker japanese yen 

refining solutions 

refining solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2014  were 8521 million  an increase of 769 million  or 10  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  this increase was primarily due 351 million of increased clean fuels technology sales volumes 237 million of increase heavy oil upgrading sales volumes 14 million of increased chemical catalysts sales volumes and 166 million of favorable price impacts in both heavy oil upgrading and clean fuels technology refining solutions adjusted ebitda increased   35  or 661 million  to 2565 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  in comparison to the corresponding period of 2013  this increase was due primarily to higher overall sales volumes improved pricing and a 31 million increase in equity income reported by our nippon ketjen company limited joint venture primarily due to higher sales volumes 

all other 

all other net sales for the year ended december 31 2014  were 4718 million  a decrease of 54 million  or 1  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the decrease was driven mainly by 278 million of unfavorable fine chemistry services volumes partially offset by 113 million of increased minerals sales volumes 93 million of improved price impacts and 19 million of favorable currency exchange impacts all other adjusted ebitda was up 3  or 23 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  in comparison to the same period in 2014  this increase was due primarily to a favorable mix of sales volumes 93 million of favorable price impacts and lower sga costs 

corporate 

corporate adjusted ebitda was a charge of   749 million   for the year ended   december 31 2014  an increase of 56 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the change was due mainly to unfavorable incentive compensation costs 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

property plant and equipment  we assign the useful lives of our property plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment range from 2 to 60 years and depreciation is recorded on the straightline method with the exception of our longterm mineral rights which are depleted on a unitsofproduction method we evaluate the recovery of our property plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized 

acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and 



outflows discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates market prices and tax rates among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 2 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes  we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions  

environmental remediation liabilities  we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions about sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions income taxes working capital and other economic or marketrelated factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2015  and concluded there was no impairment as of that date in addition no indications of impairment in any of our reporting units were indicated by the sensitivity analysis 

we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets which include trade names and inprogress research and development for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first to assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary further testing is only required if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five  to twentyfive  years except for customer lists and relationships associated with our lithium business and chemetall surface treatment segment which are amortized using the 



pattern of economic benefit method definitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method we evaluate the recovery of our definitelived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized see note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a quarterly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2015  we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

our us defined benefit plans for nonrepresented employees are closed to new participants with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2015  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2015  measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we look at longterm yields on aarated corporate bonds when available our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates particularly at the longer durations for the eurozone we apply the aon hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate for the uk the discount rate is determined by applying the aon hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of albemarle’s uk plan in other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of highquality corporate bonds we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration 

at december 31 2015  the weightedaverage discount rate for the us and foreign pension plans was increased to 467  and 289  respectively from 418  and 234  respectively at december 31 2014  to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2015  measurement date the discount rate for the opeb plans at december 31 2015  and 2014  was 459  and 415  respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2015  and 2014  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets was 685  and 691  respectively and the weightedaverage expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 563  and 400  respectively effective january 1 2016  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us and foreign pension plan assets is 690  and 565  



respectively the weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 700  during 2015  and 2014  there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on opeb plan assets effective january 1 2016  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2015  the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 317  from 340  for our foreign pension plans 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries “soa” published updated mortality tables which reflect increased life expectancy we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the soa for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2014 further the soa released an updated mortality improvement scale mp2015 on october 8 2015 the updated improvement scale incorporates two additional years of mortality data and reflects a trend toward somewhat smaller improvements in longevity in addition the soa released a set of factors to adjust the rp2014 mortality tables to base year 2006 we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate these updated mortality improvements for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2015 

at december 31 2015  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6941 million  total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2015  831 million  or approximately 12  are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 15 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not in order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities we are following guidance under asu 201517 which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet along with any related valuation allowance 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition 



threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions due to the statute of limitations we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by the internal revenue service “irs” for years prior to 2011 in 2015 the irs continued its audit of legacy albemarle’s us consolidated group for 2011 and 2012 additionally in 2015 the irs finalized its audit of legacy rockwood’s us consolidated group for 2010 and 2011 due to the statute of limitations we also are no longer subject to us state income tax audits prior to 2010 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us several audits are in process during 2015 the german tax authorities continued and announced audits on multiple german subsidiaries for various years from 2006 through 2013 the belgium tax authorities continued the audit of our belgium subsidiary for 2012 and 2013 and audits of two of our korean entities for 2011 through 2013 were closed we also have various audits ongoing for the years 2007 through 2014 related to russia the philippines india italy and france 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 33 million  as a result of closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as indefinitely invested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries if it is determined that cash can be repatriated with little to no tax consequences we may choose to repatriate cash at that time our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments funding working capital acquisitions and repayment of debt we also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 



cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 2137 million  at december 31 2015  as compared to 25 billion  at december 31 2014  cash provided by operating activities was 3607 million  4926 million  and 4329 million  during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily due to higher acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the rockwood acquisition higher payments for interest and higher payments for income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 versus 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments in 2014 partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses 

during 2015  cash on hand cash provided by operations a return of capital from an unconsolidated investment and proceeds from borrowings funded 21 billion for acquisitions 2276 million  of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 1193 million  and pension and postretirement contributions of 216 million  also during 2015 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 70 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 233 million  during 2014 cash on hand cash provided by operations and proceeds from divestitures funded payments of 1500 million for repurchases of our common stock 1106 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 841 million 334 million for the settlement of a forward starting interest rate swap debt financing costs of 176 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 139 million also during 2014 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 51 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 155 million additionally in 2014 we issued a series of new senior notes totaling approximately 19 billion during 2013 proceeds from borrowings net of repayments cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded payments of 5823 million for repurchases of our common stock 1553 million of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment dividends to shareholders of 781 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 133 million also during 2013 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid dividends of approximately 38 million which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of 100 million 

net current assets decreased to approximately 2143 million  at december 31 2015  from 221 billion  at december 31 2014  with the decrease being largely due to lower cash and cash equivalents in connection with acquisitions in 2015 included in net current assets at december 31 2015 is 2758 million of assets held for sale net of related liabilities other changes in the components of net current assets are due to the timing of the sale of goods and other normal transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company nor do they reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the normal course of business 

capital expenditures were 2276 million  1106 million  and 1553 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 230 million  in 2016  for capacity increases cost reduction and continuity of operations projects 

on november 5 2015 the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its tribotecc metal sulfides business to treibacher industrie ag included in the transaction were sites in vienna and arnoldstein austria and tribotecc’s proprietary sulfide syntheses process on january 4 2016 the company closed the sale of this business we received net proceeds of approximately 137 million and we currently expect to record a gain in the first quarter of 2016 related to the sale of this business 

on december 16 2015 the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its mineralbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses to huber engineered materials a division of jm huber corporation the transaction includes albemarle’s martinswerk gmbh subsidiary and manufacturing facility located in bergheim germany and albemarle’s 50 ownership interest in magnifin magnesiaprodukte gmbh a jointventure with radex heraklith industriebeteiligung ag at breitenau austria on february 1 2016 the company closed the sale of these businesses we received net proceeds of approximately 187 million subject to postclosing adjustments we currently expect to record a gain in the first quarter of 2016 related to the sale of these businesses 

during 2014 and 2013 we repurchased approximately 22 million shares and 92 million shares of our common stock respectively pursuant to the terms of our board authorized share repurchase program all of the shares repurchased in 2014 and approximately 71 million of the shares repurchased in 2013 were also repurchased pursuant to the terms of accelerated share repurchase agreements with major financial institutions as of december 31 2015  there were 3749340  remaining shares available for repurchase under the company’s authorized share repurchase program 



on february 26 2016  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 0305  per share a 5  increase from the quarterly rate of 029  per share paid in 2015 

during 2015 we incurred 1377 million  of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood mainly consisting of professional services and advisory fees costs to achieve synergies relocation costs and other integration costs and 84 million  of costs in connection with other significant projects in 2014 we incurred 236 million of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of rockwood and 66 million of costs in connection with other significant projects we currently anticipate incurring additional acquisition and integration related costs of approximately 60 million  through 2016 in connection with the acquisition of rockwood actual results may differ from this estimate 

at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  our cash and cash equivalents included 2007 million  and 5587 million  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely invested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely invested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we repatriated approximately 1225 million  100 million  and 72 million  of cash associated with earnings respectively as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities with regard to the access of internal cash from albemarle rockwood and their respective subsidiaries to help fund the merger the structure implemented did not impact the indefinite investment assertion of albemarle as no taxes were triggered in the movements of albemarle’s cash with regard to the acquisition of rockwood the company’s purchase price accounting included tax liabilities related to the repatriation of cash that occurred in 2015 as of december 31 2015 the deferred tax liability has been fully utilized as the repatriation planning has concluded we have asserted that substantially all future earnings of former rockwood entities have been elected to be indefinitely invested 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

our 3250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on january 20 2005 and bearing interest at a rate of 510 matured and were repaid on february 1 2015 we currently have the following senior notes outstanding 



our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures the senior notes are 



subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default 

upon completion of the rockwood acquisition we assumed rockwood’s senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 125 billion these senior notes bore interest at a rate of 4625 payable semiannually on april 15 and october 15 of each year and had a scheduled maturity of october 15 2020 under the terms of the indenture governing the 4625 senior notes as amended and supplemented on october 15 2015 our whollyowned subsidiary rockwood specialties group inc redeemed all of the outstanding 4625 senior notes at a redemption price equal to 103469 of the principal amount of the notes representing a premium of 433 million plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the guarantees of the 4625 senior notes and the senior notes we issued in 2014 were released upon repayment of the 4625 senior notes 

the 4625 senior notes we assumed from rockwood were repaid with proceeds from a new term loan agreement we entered into on september 14 2015 the “september 2015 term loan agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na the “administrative agent” and certain other lenders the september 2015 term loan agreement provides for borrowings under a 364day term loan facility the “364day facility” and a fiveyear term loan facility the “fiveyear facility” or collectively the “term loan facilities” as of december 31 2015 aggregate amounts outstanding under the 364day facility and the fiveyear facility were 3000 million and 9500 million respectively as of february 19 2016 we repaid the 364day facility in full and we repaid approximately 31 million of borrowings under the fiveyear facility each primarily with proceeds from the sale of the company’s tribotecc metal sulfides business and the sale of the company’s mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses both of which closed in the first quarter of 2016 borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to at the option of the company a the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a margin ranging from 1000 to 1875 per annum depending upon the longterm unsecured senior noncredit enhanced debt rating of the company or b a base rate defined as the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 050 ii the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent as its “prime rate” or iii onemonth libor plus 100 plus a margin of 0000 to 0875 per annum depending upon the longterm unsecured senior noncredit enhanced debt rating of the company as of december 31 2015 the interest rate on both term loan facilities was libor plus 1375 

borrowings under the 364day facility were required to be repaid 364 days after initial funding borrowings under the fiveyear facility are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments on the last business day of each march june september and december beginning with september 30 2016 and ending with the last such day to occur prior to the fifth anniversary after initial funding each a “payment date” in an aggregate principal amount equal to a in the case of each payment date occurring on or after the first anniversary and prior to the second anniversary of initial funding 125 of the aggregate principal amount of such loans and b in the case of each payment date occurring on or after the second anniversary of initial funding equal to 25 of the aggregate principal amount of such loans on the fifth anniversary after initial funding any remaining amounts outstanding under the fiveyear facility become due and payable additionally the agreement requires that proceeds from divestitures of the company’s tribotecc metal sulfides business and the company’s mineralsbased flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses and intended divestiture of its fine chemistry services business must be used to repay amounts outstanding under the september 2015 term loan agreement borrowings under the september 2015 term loan agreement are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants including a maximum leverage ratio requirement that is aligned with the maximum leverage ratio requirement of our february 2014 credit agreement 

our revolving unsecured credit agreement dated as of february 7 2014 as amended the “february 2014 credit agreement” currently provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion and matures on february 7 2020 borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1000 to 1700 depending on the company’s credit rating from standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” moody’s investors services “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” the applicable margin on the facility was 1300 as of december 31 2015 there were no borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement as of december 31 2015 

borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” or “adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter b with the exception of certain liens as specified in the agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the february 2014 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and c with the exception of certain indebtedness as specified in the agreement subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement on august 15 2014 certain amendments were 



made to the february 2014 credit agreement which includes among other things an increase in the maximum leverage ratio as described above from 350 to 450 for the first four quarters following the completion of the acquisition of rockwood stepping down by 025 on a quarterly basis thereafter until reaching 350 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company our february 2014 credit agreement is available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 10 billion current maximum amount available under the february 2014 credit agreement the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2015  we had 3513 million  of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 107  and a weightedaverage maturity of 29 days  the commercial paper notes are classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 32 billion  at december 31 2015  compared to 22 billion  at december 31 2014  the increase is attributable to debt associated with the acquisition of rockwood in addition at december 31 2015  we had the ability to borrow 6487 million  under our commercial paper program and the february 2014 credit agreement and 1541 million  under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our february 2014 credit agreement we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2015  we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information about our longterm debt obligations see note 14 “longterm debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 638 million  at december 31 2015  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2015  in thousands 



 52 



amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” are expected to approximate 13 million  in 2016  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 180 million  to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2015  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 1017 million  and 253 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 509 million  and 221 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future with the acquisition of rockwood now closed our main focus over the next three years in terms of uses of cash will be deleveraging to restore our borrowings to more normal levels and capturing synergies related to the integration of rockwood this may include refinancing certain of our existing outstanding debt if market conditions are favorable additionally we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability additionally realization and timing of anticipated divestitures could have a significant impact on our cash flows in any given period 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic andor geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time if such concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before 2019 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 2137 million  as of december 31 2015  of which 2007 million  is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities substantially all of this cash is held and intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies 



in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 422 million  357 million  and 440 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2015  totaled approximately 353 million  an increase  of 261 million  from 92 million  at december 31 2014  see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 250 million  152 million  and 141 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen singapore dollar chinese renminbi australian dollar chilean peso and the british pound sterling in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged unless otherwise noted gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2015  our financial instruments which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 2177 million  and with a fair value representing a net liability position of 03 million  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2015  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease  of approximately 02 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase  of approximately 192 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2015  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 17 billion  and 3923 million  outstanding at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively these borrowings represented 44  and 13  of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 151  and 082  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 15  basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 26 million  as of december 31 2015  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility 



related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

customers 

our performance chemicals segment offers more than 150 products to a variety of end markets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers including pharmaceutical and agricultural companies drilling and oil service companies beef and poultry processors water treatment and photographic companies energy producers and other specialty chemical companies 

sales of performance chemicals in asia are expected to grow longterm due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states “us” and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the us europe china and the middle east 

pricing for many of our performance chemicals products and services is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

a number of customers of our performance chemicals segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical 

competition 

our performance chemicals segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the performance chemicals marketplace 

we are a market leader in the brominebased product groups including flame retardants and our most significant competitors are chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd we are also a market leader in the mineralbased flame 



retardants business in our mineralbased flame retardants business our most significant competitors include jm huber corporation kyowa chemical industry co ltd and nabaltec gmbh we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new high quality innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our performance chemicals operations are bromine bisphenola potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alphaolefins methyl amines propylene benzene caustic soda alumina trihydrate and polystyrene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

the bromine we use in our performance chemicals segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 70  years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we have a joint venture with weifang sinobrom import and export company ltd “sinobrom” in china that allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 

catalyst solutions segment 

as of december 31 2014 our catalyst solutions segment included the refinery catalyst solutions and performance catalyst solutions product categories 

refinery catalyst solutions  our two main refinery catalysts businesses are clean fuels technologies which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts “hpc” and heavy oil upgrading which is primarily composed of fluidized catalytic cracking “fcc” catalysts and additives hpc products are widely applied throughout the refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes we continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market fcc catalysts assist in the high yield cracking of less desired refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs we offer a wide range of hpc products and approximately 60  different fcc catalysts and additives products to our customers

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alphaolefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin rare earths molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility these raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility despite our mitigating efforts our profitability may be affected if we are unable to recover significant raw material costs from our customers 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers within north america europe the middle east india asia pacific russia africa and latin america we also use approximately 75  commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are affiliated with subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments as of december 31 2014 the focus of research in performance chemicals is divided among new and improved flame retardants new uses for bromine and brominebased products curing agents and the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries fire safety solutions research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles such as our greenarmor ™  flame retardant product that are greatly enhanced in both end product performance and environmental 



responsibility another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

as of december 31 2014 catalyst solutions research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers our performance catalysts customers and developing metal organics for led and other electronic applications refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the performance catalysts area we are focused primarily on catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems for polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers as well as metal organics for electronic customers 

we have incurred research and development expenses of 883 million  822 million  and 789 million  during 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2014  we owned approximately 1800  active us and foreign patents and approximately 800  pending us and foreign patent applications we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2014  with an occupational injury and illness rate of 0327  for albemarle employees and nested contractors down from 055  in 2013  

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern—such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic “cmrs” persistent bioaccumulative and toxic “pbts” very persistent very bioaccumulative “vpvb” and endocrine disruptors—will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2009 one of our products was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern under authorization hexabromocyclododecane “hbcd” our sales of hbcd approximated 07  13  and 19  of our total annual net sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in 2012 another of our products decabromodiphenyl ether “decabde” similarly was identified as a substance of very high concern our sales of decabde were negligible in 2014 and approximated 03 of our total annual net sales in 2013 and 07 of our total annual net sales in 2012 albemarle ceased production of decabde effective at the end of 2012 albemarle actively conducts research and development activities to find more sustainable substitutes for products such as hbcd and decabde that may be subject to restrictions for example in august of 2014 albemarle announced a joint venture with icl industrial products “icl” for the production of greencrest tm  a substitute chemical for hbcd with a superior environmental profile 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 

recently there has been increased scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 



environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 55 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities the company seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids 



and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted 

recent acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures 

over the last three years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during recent years 

on july 15 2014 we entered into the merger agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of rockwood on january 12 2015 we completed the acquisition of rockwood for a purchase price of approximately 56 billion comprised of approximately 36 billion in cash consideration and approximately 20 billion in equity consideration with rockwood becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of albemarle rockwood is a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced and high value added specialty chemicals it is a leading integrated and low cost global producer of lithium and lithium compounds used in lithium ion batteries for electronic devices transportation vehicles and future energy storage technologies meeting the significant growth in global demand for these products rockwood is also one of the largest global producers of surface treatments and coatings for metal processing servicing the automotive aerospace and general industrial markets the acquisition of rockwood reflects our commitment to drive sustainable growth creating one of the world’s premier specialty chemicals companies with marketleading positions across four highmargin businesses lithium catalysts bromine and surface treatment on a combined basis the company is expected to drive growth through 

 on august 29 2014 we announced an agreement with icl to establish a manufacturing joint venture for the production of icl’s fr122p polymeric flame retardant and our greencrest™ polymeric flame retardant these flame retardants are designed to replace hbcd the joint venture and its partners will own and operate a 2400 mt per year netherlands plant and a 10000 mt per year israel plant the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2015

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations 

in general raw material costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in the pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as lithium brine bromine crude oil 



chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of energy or critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of global specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources in addition our products are facing increasing competition from market participants in china these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

within the enduse markets in which we compete competition between products is intense substitute products also exist for many of our products therefore we face substantial risk that certain events such as new product development by our competitors changing customer needs production advances for competing products price changes in raw materials and products our failure to secure patents or the expiration of patents could result in declining demand for our products as our customers switch to substitute products or undertake manufacturing of such products on their own if we are unable to develop produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors our results of operations may materially suffer 

we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong longterm relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance reduce costs or support new product development to satisfy these growing customer requirements our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions we may also need to invest and spend more on research and development and marketing costs to strengthen existing customer relationships as well as attract new customers our indebtedness could limit our flexibility to react to these industry trends and our ability to remain competitive 

albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make false or unsubstantiated claims implies immoral or improper conduct or is otherwise disparaging to our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction oilfield and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and 



profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products should a customer decide to use a different material due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

our industries and the enduse markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement manufacturers periodically introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key enduse markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop manufacture and market products in such changing enduse markets we will have to continue to identify develop market and in certain cases secure regulatory approval for innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position we may not be successful in developing new products andor technology either alone or with third parties or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval if we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our enduse markets on a competitive basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 



we also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us however we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 13 



 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

furthermore our subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations related to antibribery prohibitions of the us and other countries and export controls and economic embargoes violations of which may carry substantial penalties for example export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines enforcement actions andor have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi brazilian real and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2014  approximately 26  of our net sales were denominated in such currencies significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

our business could be adversely affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which our raw materials products and facilities are subject 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties further some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation these regulations affect the manufacturing processes handling uses and applications of our products in addition our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits that are subject to renewal due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to operate our operations ongoing compliance with such laws regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing the cost of registrationapproval requirements the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products as well as the costs of the storage and disposal of wastes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may incur substantial costs including fines damages criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for 



violations arising under these laws or permit requirements furthermore environmental laws are subject to change and have tended to become stricter over time such changes in environmental laws or their interpretation or the enactment of new environmental laws could result in materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

we may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested 

in connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers for certain types of matters such as certain breaches of representations and warranties taxes and certain environmental matters 

with respect to environmental matters the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws 

we may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments further we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there has been increasing concern regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change for example some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide andor “cap and trade” legislation that could have impacts on 



our operations in addition we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfcc” which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 an amendment was passed by the unfcc during the december 2012 doha climate change talks that would implement a second commitment period through 2020 but the amendment has not entered into legal force pending acceptance by participating countries the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect us 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications to protect people property and the environment from the negative consequences of fire concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

in 2009 one of our products hbcd was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern in february 2011 the european union included hbcd on a list of substances published under annex xiv of the reach regulation our expectation is that the sale of hbcd could be banned in europe under the reach process as early as august 2015 or as late as august 2019 assuming certain applications are authorized during a period of transition to alternative products a final decision on authorization is expected by mid2015 also in august 2013 the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants banned hbcd under the convention effective november 2014 with certain uses exempted for a five year period to allow time for the development of alternative products japan chose not to apply for an exemption and as a result sales of hbcd ended in japan in 2014 certain other countries also did not file for an exemption however none of those countries are significant consumers of hbcd our sales of hbcd approximated 07  13  and 19  of our total annual net sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively there is no assurance that we will be able to develop alternative products in the future that generate sales comparable to hbcd however albemarle is actively marketing a new polymeric flame retardant based on bromine greencrest™ as a replacement for hbcd with commercial sales starting in 2014 

agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of 



the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees also because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products we may be requested to participate in or fund in whole or in part the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer for example some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 

our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action 

a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we continually assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued 



service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2014  we had 3625  employees approximately 11  of our 1830  us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2017 and 2019 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of albemarle and rockwood and therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

realization of the anticipated benefits in the merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses and operations of albemarle and rockwood we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating business practices operations and support functions 

our success after the merger will also depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees after the merger is completed the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies’ operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial results financial condition or our stock price the integration process may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses there can be no assurance that the contemplated synergies anticipated from the merger will be realized if the integration is not successful the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset the integration and restructuring costs over time 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include

 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees as of december 31 2014 the us plans represented approximately 93  of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

in previous years we have made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans under the pension protection act of 2006 we anticipate no required cash contributions during 2015  for our us qualified defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2015  may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

further an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets our results of operations our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity for example we have several pension plans located in germany belgium japan and the united states our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 



we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our february 2014 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our february 2014 credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 51 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our february 2014 credit agreement and our commercial paper program bear interest at floating rates the rates under the february 2014 credit agreement are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors services “moody’s” sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa3 sp has rated our commercial paper as a3 and moody’s has rated it as p3 sp andor moody’s may downgrade our ratings in the future the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

we may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness related to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy in addition the indentures governing our senior notes does not limit our 



ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants as a result we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 

as a result of the merger albemarle on a consolidated basis incurred substantial additional indebtedness and related debt service obligations this additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences including 

 we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from rockwood preacquisition periods 

under the terms of certain purchase agreements third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to rockwood’s preacquisition periods to the extent such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 

our required capital expenditures may exceed our estimates 

our capital expenditures for continuing operations generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment and substantial investments in new equipment commencement of production requires startup commission and certification of product quality by our customers which may impact the expected timing of sales of product from such facility construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including among others the ability to complete the project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products 

future capital expenditures may be significantly higher depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments if we are unable to do so we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets

on july 22 2014 a putative class action complaint was filed in the chancery division of the superior court of new jersey mercer county “superior court of new jersey” relating to the merger on july 24 2014 an additional putative class action complaint was filed in the superior court of new jersey relating to the merger both suits named the same plaintiff but were filed by different law firms on august 1 2014 and august 12 2014 three additional putative class action complaints were filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware “delaware chancery court” relating to the merger the lawsuits filed in new jersey thwaites v rockwood holdings inc et al “thwaites i” thwaites v rockwood holdings inc et al “thwaites ii” and the lawsuits filed in delaware rudman partners lp v rockwood holdings inc et al riley v rockwood holdings inc et al and north miami beach police officers  firefighters’ retirement plan v rockwood holdings inc et al each named rockwood its former directors and albemarle as defendants thwaites ii and the cases filed in delaware also named albemarle holdings corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of albemarle as a defendant the lawsuits which contain substantially similar allegations included allegations that rockwood’s former board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger by failing to ensure that rockwood shareholders would receive the maximum value for their shares failing to conduct an appropriate sale process and putting their own interests ahead of those of rockwood shareholders rockwood and albemarle are alleged to have aided and abetted the alleged fiduciary breaches the 



lawsuits sought a variety of equitable relief including enjoining the former rockwood board of directors from proceeding with the proposed merger unless they acted in accordance with their fiduciary duties to maximize shareholder value and rescission of the merger to the extent implemented in addition to damages arising from the defendants’ alleged breaches and attorneys’ fees and costs on august 12 2014 the plaintiff in thwaites i filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to all defendants on august 27 2014 the delaware court of chancery ordered the three delaware cases consolidated and appointed colead counsel the court also ordered that no response to the complaints would be due until after plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint on september 19 2014 the plaintiff in thwaites ii filed an amended complaint which included allegations that the registration statement failed to disclose material information 

plaintiffs in thwaites ii and in the delaware consolidated action subsequently coordinated their litigation efforts and the delaware consolidated action was stayed pending the outcome of the thwaites ii litigation in thwaites ii the parties including the delaware plaintiffs entered into a memorandum of understanding on november 6 2014 provisionally settling all claims in the pending actions and declaring the parties’ intent to submit a settlement agreement for the court’s approval within 90 days on december 2 2014 the parties submitted a joint stipulation to extend the defendants’ time to respond to the amended complaint in thwaites ii until february 4 2015 the parties executed a final stipulation of settlement and release “stipulation” on february 4 2015 which will be submitted to the superior court of new jersey for approval in addition to extinguishing the current claims the stipulation contemplates broad releases of any and all actual and potential claims whether known or unknown by any member of the putative shareholder class against the defendants relating to or arising out of the merger the merger agreement or the registration statement upon final approval of the settlement by the superior court of new jersey plaintiffs in the delaware actions will move to dismiss the pending consolidated action with prejudice thereby terminating the litigation 

on february 19 2015 verition multistrategy master fund ltd and verition partners master fund ltd who collectively owned approximately 882000 shares of rockwood common stock immediately prior to the merger commenced an action in the delaware chancery court seeking appraisal of their shares of rockwood stock pursuant to delaware general corporation law § 262 these shareholders exercised their right not to receive the merger consideration which was comprised of i 5065 in cash without interest and ii 04803 of a share of albemarle common stock for each share of rockwood common stock owned by such shareholders following the merger these shareholders ceased to have any rights with respect to their rockwood shares except for their rights to seek an appraisal of the cash value of their rockwood shares under delaware law while albemarle intends to vigorously defend against this action the outcome of the appraisal process cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation where appropriate we may establish financial reserves for such proceedings we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

overview 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that meet customer needs across an exceptionally diverse range of end markets including the petroleum refining consumer electronics construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection food safety and custom chemistry services markets we are committed to global sustainability and are advancing responsible ecopractices and solutions in our two business segments we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible lowcost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts ongoing productivity improvements and strong balance sheet will position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging economic environment 

2014 highlights 

 



outlook 

on july 15 2014 we entered into the merger agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of rockwood on january 12 2015 we completed the acquisition of rockwood for a purchase price of approximately 56 billion comprised of approximately 36 billion in cash consideration and approximately 20 billion in equity consideration with rockwood becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of albemarle for additional information see note 23 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

on january 20 2015 we announced that as a result of the completion of the rockwood acquisition we will realign our organizational structure to be effective by the end of the first quarter of 2015 at that time the company’s new reportable business segments will consist of three segments performance chemicals refining solutions and chemetall surface treatment performance chemicals will combine our lithium aluminum alkyls and derivative catalysts businesses with albemarle’s existing performance chemicals segment refining solutions will consist of the heavy oil upgrading and clean fuels technologies businesses delivering a robust portfolio of catalyst solutions that apply to the entire refinery process chemetall surface treatment will supply specialty chemicals with a focus on processes for the surface treatment of metals and plastics each segment will have a dedicated team of sales rd process engineering manufacturing and sourcing and business strategy personnel and will have full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus agility and responsiveness additionally in 2015 we intend to pursue strategic alternatives including divestitures related to certain product lines including flame retardants specialty chemicals fine chemistry services and metal sulfides these businesses will not be included in the aforementioned segments 

the current business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve from a slow and uneven global economic recovery significantly lower crude oil prices pricing pressure on bromine derivatives and an everchanging landscape in electronics to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers a volatile currency exchange landscape and increasingly stringent environmental standards amidst these dynamics our business fundamentals are sound and we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio through pricing and product development managing costs and delivering value to our customers we believe that our businesses remain positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and longterm trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to improved economic conditions 

through 2014 our operations were managed and reported as two operating segments performance chemicals and catalyst solutions financial results and discussion about our operating segments included in this annual report on form 10k are categorized according to these two operating segments except where noted 

performance chemicals  we expect 2015 sales performance to be comparable overall to the prior year as we manage through an uncertain environment characterized by soft demand in certain products and applications and cautious inventory management by our customers along with the uncertain impacts of much weaker oil prices and a much stronger us dollar particularly as compared to the european union euro and the japanese yen we believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on maximizing our bromine franchise value 

we believe that the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our strong cost position product innovations and effective management of raw material inventory inflation will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that will come with favorable market trends in select end markets and with a more evenly sustained economic recovery our view of third party market indicators and order book trends makes us cautiously optimistic that volume trends for brominated flame retardants have stabilized and that demand for bromine in other applications aside from drilling completion fluids will continue to increase at a rate consistent with overall economic demand 

on a longterm basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living widespread digitization increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products demand for drilling completion fluids in 2015 may be impacted negatively as a result of sharply lower oil prices impacting offshore drilling projects around the world clear completion fluids shipment rates slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2014 consistent with this view longer term absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling we would expect this business to resume the solid growth trajectory of recent years once oil prices return to prices seen through most of 2014 as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap will tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expand over time 



catalyst solutions  2014 was a solid year for this business segment with sales up 9 and profits up 15 on a combination of favorable volumes price and product mix especially in our refinery catalyst solutions product lines our performance catalyst solutions business lines stabilized in 2014 driven by growth in our downstream catalysts business and demand growth in our organometallics product lines as polyolefins demand continued to grow at a 45 rate we expect continued growth in our refinery catalyst solutions business despite some concerns about how the price of oil will impact the crude slate used by refineries and the resulting demand for catalysts and some expected product mix impact that is a result of timing of catalysts replacements in fixed bed units we also expect 2015 to bring increasing stabilization and improvement in our catalysts for polyolefins consistent with overall demand 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for petroleum products and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refinery catalyst solutions business in addition we expect growth in our performance catalyst solutions division to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending particularly in asia and the middle east 

delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry and our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields while lower oil prices may impact the overall crude slate for a period of time longer term we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour trends that bode well for catalysts demand given this and based on our technology current production capacities and expected growth in end market demand we remain wellpositioned for the future 

corporate and other  we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies we expect our global effective tax rate for 2015  to be approximately 250  however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate and other as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2014  include an actuarial loss of 1308 million   833 million  after income taxes as compared to a gain of 1390 million   883 million  after income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013  

in the first quarter of 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend payout to 0275 per share we also repurchased approximately 22 million shares of our common stock during 2014 for 150 million under our existing share repurchase program and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis in the first quarter of 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 029  per share 

we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint additional information regarding our products markets and financial performance is provided at our web site wwwalbemarlecom  our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference

comparison of 2014  to 2013 

net sales

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets  we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes  we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions  

environmental remediation liabilities  we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2014  and concluded there was no impairment as of that date 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five  to twentyfive  years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance see note 11 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a quarterly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2014  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate and mortality scales we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2014  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2014  measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we relied on aon hewitt methods including the aon hewitt topquartile and a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aagraded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount 



rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 

at december 31 2014  the weightedaverage discount rate was decreased for the pension plans from 500  to 403  and for the opeb plans from 503  to 415  to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2014  measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2014  and 2013  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 691  and 725  respectively the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets is 689  effective january 1 2015  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 700  during 2014  and 2013  there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on opeb plan assets effective january 1 2015  our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 and benefit accruals were frozen effective december 31 2014 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 which was expanded to include all nonrepresented employees effective january 1 2013 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2014  the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 340  from 278  for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 350  for the opeb plans at december 31 2014  and 2013 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries published updated mortality tables which reflect increased life expectancy we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries for purposes of measuring our us pension and opeb obligations at december 31 2014 

at december 31 2014  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6121 million  total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2014  807 million  or approximately 13  are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 18 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 



income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by tax authorities for years prior to 2011 since the internal revenue service “irs” has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 and our statute of limitations has expired for 2008 through 2010 in 2014 the irs commenced an audit of 2011 through 2012 we also are no longer subject to any us state income tax audits prior to 2010 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006 during 2014 the german tax authorities continued the audit of two of our german subsidiaries for 2006 through 2009 that began in 2011 additionally we received notification from the korean tax authorities of an audit to commence in 2015 for years 2011 through 2013 for one of our korean subsidiaries in january of 2015 we received notification from the belgium tax authorities of an audit for 2012 through 2013 of one of our belgium subsidiaries during 2013 the chinese tax authorities completed an audit of one of our chinese subsidiaries for 2006 through 2010 that began in 2011 no significant tax was assessed as a result of the completed audits 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 07 million  as a result of closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as indefinitely invested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits “ep” principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 



internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 “sox 404” requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on form 10k our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting status and updates are provided to executive management and our audit and finance committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business and functional groups we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments funding working capital acquisitions and repayment of debt we also make contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 25 billion  at december 31 2014  as compared to 4772 million  at december 31 2013  cash provided by operating activities was 4926 million  4329 million  and 4888 million  during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 versus 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and higher dividends received from unconsolidated investments in 2014 partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 versus 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from our businesses due mainly to overall unfavorable pricing impacts unfavorable currency impacts mainly from a weaker japanese yen and higher manufacturing costs these were partly offset by favorable impacts from lower variable input costs and favorable overall volumes the unfavorable impact on cash flow due to lower gross profit was partly offset by lower contributions to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans in 2013 included in contributions for the year ended december 31 2012 is a contribution of 141 million to our supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman 

during 2014  cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded payments of 1500 million  for repurchases of our common stock capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1106 million  dividends to shareholders of 841 million  334 million for the settlement of a forward starting interest rate swap debt financing costs of 176 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 139 million  also during 2014 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid a dividend of approximately 51 million which resulted in a dividend to noncontrolling interests of 155 million additionally in the third quarter of 2014 we closed the sale of our antioxidant ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets for net proceeds of 1047 million and a receivable of 76 million which was collected in the first quarter of 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2014 we issued a series of new senior notes totaling approximately 19 billion as further described in longterm debt  below during 2013 proceeds from borrowings net of repayments cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded payments of 5823 million for repurchases of our common stock capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1553 



million dividends to shareholders of 781 million and pension and postretirement contributions of 133 million also during 2013 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid a dividend of approximately 38 million which resulted in a dividend to noncontrolling interests of 100 million in 2012 cash on hand and cash from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 2809 million advances to joint ventures of 250 million repayments of debt net of borrowings of 638 million repurchases of shares of our common stock of 636 million dividends to shareholders of 691 million and 91 million in withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation amounts distributed during the period 

net current assets increased to approximately 221 billion  at december 31 2014  from 105 billion  at december 31 2013  the increase in net current assets was due primarily to higher cash on hand at december 31 2014 in connection with the issuance of new senior notes in 2014 partially offset by the reclassification of our commercial paper notes and 510 senior notes from longterm debt to current portion of longterm debt in 2014 other changes in the components of net current assets are due to the timing of the sale of goods and other normal transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the company nor do they reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the normal course of business 

capital expenditures were 1106 million  1553 million  and 2809 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 235 million in 2015  for capacity increases cost reduction and continuity of operations projects 

we made contributions to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans of 139 million  133 million  and 216 million  during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively included in contributions for the year ended december 31 2012 is a contribution of 141 million to our serp in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman 

on february 12 2013 our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under its existing share repurchase program to 15 million from 39 million shares that remained outstanding under the program as of december 31 2012 during 2014 2013 and 2012 we repurchased approximately 22 million shares 92 million shares and 11 million shares of our common stock respectively pursuant to the terms of our board authorized share repurchase program all of the shares repurchased in 2014 and approximately 71 million of the shares repurchased in 2013 were also repurchased pursuant to the terms of accelerated share repurchase agreements with major financial institutions as of december 31 2014 we had no accelerated share repurchase agreements outstanding 

on february 24 2015  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 029  per share a 5  increase from the quarterly rate of 0275  per share paid in 2014 

during 2014 we initiated action to reduce high cost supply capacity of certain aluminum alkyl products primarily through the termination of a third party manufacturing contract based on the contract termination we estimated costs of approximately 205 million for contract termination and volume commitments additionally we have recorded an impairment charge of 30 million for certain capital project costs also related to aluminum alkyls capacity which we do not expect to recover after income taxes these charges were approximately 155 million we expect to realize annual savings of up to 3 million as a result of this capacity reduction beginning within the next two years 

also during 2014 we incurred 236 million of acquisition and integration related costs in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and 66 million of acquisitionrelated costs in connection with other significant projects we currently anticipate incurring additional acquisition and integration related costs of approximately 200 million over the next two years in connection with the acquisition of rockwood actual results may differ from this estimate 

on february 19 2015 verition multistrategy master fund ltd and verition partners master fund ltd who collectively owned approximately 882000 shares of rockwood common stock immediately prior to the merger commenced an action in the delaware chancery court seeking appraisal of their shares of rockwood stock pursuant to delaware general corporation law § 262 these shareholders exercised their right not to receive the merger consideration which was comprised of i 5065 in cash without interest and ii 04803 of a share of albemarle common stock for each share of rockwood common stock owned by such shareholders following the merger these shareholders ceased to have any rights with respect to their rockwood shares except for their rights to seek an appraisal of the cash value of their rockwood shares under delaware law while albemarle intends to vigorously defend against this action the outcome of the appraisal process cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time 

in connection with the announced realignment of our operating segments effective january 1 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a workforce reduction plan which resulted in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded charges of 334 million 219 million after income taxes for termination benefits and 



other costs related to this workforce reduction plan payments under this workforce reduction plan were substantially completed in 2014 

in 2012 we recorded net charges amounting to 1008 million 761 million after income taxes in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business we began to realize favorable profit impacts from this program in the fourth quarter of 2012 

at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  our cash and cash equivalents included 5587 million  and 3883 million  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely invested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely invested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we repatriated approximately 100 million  72 million  and 706 million  in cash respectively as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities in late december 2014 albemarle commenced the implementation of its plans to access internal cash from albemarle rockwood and their respective subsidiaries to help fund the merger the structure implemented did not impact the indefinite investment assertion of albemarle as no taxes were triggered in the movements of albemarle’s cash 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we are optimistic that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we issued a series of senior notes collectively the “2014 senior notes” as follows 

 we also have outstanding 3500 million of 450 senior notes due in 2020 

our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries as is customary for such longterm debt instruments each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the comparable government rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus between 25 and 40 basis points depending on the note plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures the senior notes are subject to typical events of default including bankruptcy and insolvency events nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of 40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default 



our 3250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on january 20 2005 and bearing interest at a rate of 510 matured and were repaid on february 1 2015 as a result of the refinancing of these senior notes prior to december 31 2014 these senior notes were included in current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2014 

in anticipation of refinancing our 510 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2014 on january 22 2014 we entered into a pay fixed receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swap with jp morgan chase bank na to be effective october 15 2014 our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking this hedge was to eliminate the variability in the interest rate and partial credit spread on the 20 future semiannual coupon payments that we will pay in connection with our 415 senior notes the notional amount of the swap was 3250 million and the fixed rate was 3281 with the cash settlement determined by reference to the changes in the us dollar 3month libor and credit spreads from the date we entered into the swap until the date the swap was settled october 15 2014 this derivative financial instrument was designated accounted for as a cash flow hedge under accounting standards codification “asc” 815 derivatives and hedging  we determined there was no ineffectiveness during the term of the swap on october 15 2014 the swap was settled resulting in a payment to the counterparty of 334 million this amount was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 415 senior notes 

on february 7 2014 we entered into a new 7500 million credit facility the fiveyear revolving unsecured credit agreement hereinafter referred to as the february 2014 credit agreement matures on february 7 2019 and replaced our previous 7500 million amended and restated credit agreement dated as of september 22 2011 borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0900 to 1500 depending on the company’s credit rating from sp and moody’s the applicable margin on the facility was 1300 as of december 31 2014 

borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items or herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter b with the exception of certain liens as specified in the agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the february 2014 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and c with the exception of certain indebtedness as specified in the agreement subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement 

on august 15 2014 certain amendments were made to the february 2014 credit agreement which include the following a an increase in the maximum leverage ratio as described above from 350 to 450 for the first four quarters following the completion of the acquisition of rockwood stepping down by 025 on a quarterly basis thereafter until reaching 350 b modification of the indebtedness covenant to permit the incurrence of indebtedness represented by rockwood’s former senior notes due in 2020 and c requiring subsidiaries of albemarle that guarantee rockwood’s former senior notes or that guarantee the 2014 senior notes to also guarantee the february 2014 credit agreement 

on december 22 2014 the february 2014 credit agreement was further amended to provide for among other things an increase in the aggregate commitments under the facility to 10 billion as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “commercial paper notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 7500 million the proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company our february 2014 credit agreement is available to repay the commercial paper notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement and the commercial paper notes will not exceed the 10 billion current maximum amount available under the february 2014 credit agreement the commercial paper notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance the maturities of the commercial paper notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions at december 31 2014  we had 3672 million  of commercial paper notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 079  and a weightedaverage maturity of 25 days  in order to maintain flexibility with regard to our liquidity strategy in the second quarter of 2014 the commercial paper notes were reclassified from longterm debt to current portion of longterm debt 



on august 15 2014 we entered into a term loan credit agreement the “term loan” providing for a tranche of senior unsecured term loans in an aggregate amount of 10 billion amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and pay related fees and expenses borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on an average libor for deposits in dollars plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1125 to 2000 depending on our credit rating from sp and moody’s as of december 31 2014 the applicable margin over libor was 1500 term loan borrowings will be guaranteed by the subsidiaries of albemarle that guarantee rockwood’s former senior notes or that guarantee the 2014 senior notes the term loan matures 364 days following the date of funding which occurred on january 12 2015 borrowings are conditioned upon compliance with one financial covenant which requires that our maximum leverage ratio must be less than or equal to 450 times consolidated adjusted ebitda as of the end of any fiscal quarter as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings outstanding under the term loan 

on december 2 2014 we entered into a new senior unsecured credit facility the “cash bridge facility” pursuant to which the lenders thereunder provided for up to 115 billion in loans the cash bridge facility is guaranteed by each of the company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the february 2014 credit agreement amounts borrowed under the cash bridge facility were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of rockwood and pay related fees and expenses and mature 60 days following the completion of rockwood acquisition the interest rate on amounts outstanding will be either a libor or b an alternate base rate defined as the highest of i bank of america’s prime rate ii the federal funds rate plus 050 and iii a daily rate equal to onemonth libor plus 100 plus in each case an applicable margin based on our credit rating structuring and underwriting fees of approximately 190 million were paid in 2014 in connection with the bridge facilities as of december 31 2014 there were no borrowings outstanding under the cash bridge facility 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 22 billion  at december 31 2014  compared to 11 billion  at december 31 2013  the increase is attributable to the issuance of the 2014 senior notes partially offset by the reclassification of the commercial paper notes to current portion of longterm debt in addition at december 31 2014  we had the ability to borrow 6328 million  under our commercial paper program and the february 2014 credit agreement and 2124 million  under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our february 2014 credit agreement we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2014  we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

on january 12 2015 we completed the acquisition of rockwood for a purchase price of approximately 56 billion comprised of approximately 36 billion in cash consideration and approximately 20 billion in equity consideration with rockwood becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of albemarle the cash consideration was funded with proceeds from our 2014 senior notes and borrowings of 10 billion under the term loan 8000 million under the cash bridge facility and 2500 million under the february 2014 credit agreement in january 2015 the cash bridge facility was repaid in full and repayments totaling 8165 million were made under the term loan in february 2015 the remaining balance outstanding under the term loan was repaid in full and amounts borrowed under the february 2014 credit agreement in connection with the acquisition 2500 million were also repaid in full such repayments were made with a combination of existing cash cash acquired from rockwood cash from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program 

upon the completion of the rockwood acquisition we assumed rockwood’s 4625 senior notes due 2020 which had an outstanding balance of approximately 12 billion at the date of closing 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 301 million  at december 31 2014  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 



other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2014  in thousands 



 the contractual obligation at december 31 2014 to purchase rockwood plus the assumption of rockwood’s debt and other obligations has been omitted from the above table the acquisition was completed on january 12 2015 

amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our serp are expected to approximate 5 million  in 2015  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of approximately 100 million  to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2014  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 253 million  and 298 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 221 million  and 257 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future with the acquisition of rockwood now being closed our main focus over the next 18 to 24 months in terms of uses of cash will be deleveraging to restore our borrowings to more normal levels however as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the corporate bond and debt markets remain strong volatility has increased in all capital markets over the past few years during times of uncertainty such as european sovereign debt and us budget concerns if these concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature in addition our cash flows from operations may be negatively 



affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

overall with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant longterm debt maturities before 2019 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 25 billion  as of december 31 2014  of which 5587 million  is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities with the exception of the cash that was used to a fund the cash portion of the merger consideration and b repay our 510 senior notes substantially all of this cash is held and intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 357 million  440 million  and 390 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2014  totaled approximately 92 million  a decrease  of 74 million  from 166 million  at december 31 2013  see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 152 million  141 million  and 254 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to a the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and b uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 



recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting guidance that requires entities that have obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements and for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date to measure such obligations as the sum of a the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its coobligors and b any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its coobligors entities are also required to disclose the nature amount and any other relevant information about such obligations these amendments became effective on january 1 2014 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance that clarifies a parent company’s accounting for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment when the parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity the guidance clarifies that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both a events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and b events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date sometimes also referred to as a step acquisition accordingly the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events these amendments became effective on january 1 2014 and had no impact on our accounting for the sale of our antioxidant ibuprofen and propofol businesses and assets in 2014 

in july 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance designed to reduce diversity in practice of financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists these new requirements became effective on january 1 2014 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2014 the fasb issued accounting guidance that changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements to provide users of financial statements with more information about the assets liabilities revenues and expenses of discontinued operations the guidance modifies the definition of discontinued operations by limiting its scope to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results additionally these new requirements require entities to disclose the pretax profit or loss related to disposals of significant components that do not qualify as discontinued operations these new requirements become effective for public entities in annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 and interim periods within those years the impact of these new requirements is dependent on the nature of dispositions if any after adoption 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting guidance designed to enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities industries jurisdictions and capital markets the core principle of the guidance is that revenue recognized from a transaction or event that arises from a contract with a customer should reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services provided to achieve that core principle the new guidance sets forth a fivestep revenue recognition model that will need to be applied consistently to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the asc also required are new disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers the new disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance and assets recognized related to the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract these new requirements become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption is prohibited we are assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements 

in june 2014 the fasb issued accounting guidance which clarifies the proper method of accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period the accounting guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered these new requirements become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

in february 2015 the fasb issued accounting guidance that changes the analysis that reporting entities must perform to determine whether certain types of legal entities should be consolidated specifically the amendments affect a limited partnerships and similar legal entities b the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships and c certain investment funds these 



amendments are effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 we are assessing the impact of these amendments on our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi brazilian real and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged unless otherwise noted gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income and generally do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

at december 31 2014  our financial instruments which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 4799 million  and with a fair value representing a net asset position of 06 million  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2014  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease  of approximately 271 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase  of approximately 213 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2014  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

on december 18 2014 the carrying value of our 1875 eurodenominated senior notes was designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the euro serves as the functional currency and beginning on the date of designation gains or losses on the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency have been and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 3923 million  and 3979 million  outstanding at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively these borrowings represented 13  and 37  of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 082  and 030  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 8  basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 03 million  as of december 31 2014  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

business segments 

through 2013 our operations were managed and reported as three operating segments polymer solutions catalysts and fine chemistry financial results and discussion about our operating segments included in this annual report on form 10k are categorized according to these three operating segments except where noted 

as previously announced on september 23 2013 we realigned our operating segments effective january 1 2014 the performance chemicals segment will include fire safety solutions specialty chemicals and fine chemistry services consolidating our bromine mineral and custom manufacturing assets under one business unit the catalyst solutions segment will include refinery catalyst solutions performance catalyst solutions and antioxidants 

for financial information regarding our operating segments including revenues generated for each of the last three fiscal years from each of the product categories included in our operating segments and geographic areas see note 23 “operating segments and geographic area information” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning o n page 53 

polymer solutions 

our polymer solutions segment consists of two product market categories flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives 

flame retardants  our fire safety technology enables the use of plastics in high performance high heat applications by enhancing the flame resistant properties of these materials some of the end market products that benefit from our fire safety technology include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics printed circuit boards wire and cable electrical connectors textiles and foam insulation we compete in two major fire safety chemistries brominated and mineral our brominated flame retardants include products sold under the saytex ®  brand and our mineralbased flame retardants include products such as martinal ®  and magnifin ®  our strategy is to have a broad range of chemistries applicable to each major flame retardant application 

stabilizers and curatives  we produce plastic additives as well as other additives such as curatives antioxidants and stabilizers which are often specially developed and formulated for a customer’s specific manufacturing requirements our additives products include curatives for polyurethane polyurea and epoxy system polymerization this business also produces antioxidants and stabilizers to improve the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins we are wellpositioned for global growth notably with our leading antioxidant supplier position in the rapidly growing chinese market 

our ethacure ®  curatives are used in cast elastomers coatings reaction injection molding rim and specialty adhesives that are incorporated into products such as wheels tires and rollers our line of ethanox ®  antioxidants is used by manufacturers of polyolefins to maintain physical properties during the manufacturing process including the color of the final product these antioxidants are found in applications such as slit film wire and cable food packaging and pipes 



we also produce antioxidants used in fuels and lubricants our line of ethanox ®  fuel and lubricant antioxidants is used by refiners and fuel marketers to extend fuel storage life and protect fuel systems and by oil marketers and lubricant manufacturers to extend the useful life of lubricating oils fluids and greases used in engines and various types of machinery 

realignment  as previously announced on september 23 2013 we realigned our operating segments effective january 1 2014 as a result of this realignment the flame retardants and curatives product market categories are aligned under the performance chemicals segment and the stabilizers product market category is aligned under the catalyst solutions segment 

customers 

our polymer solutions segment offers more than 80  products to a variety of end markets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers lubricant manufacturers refiners and other specialty chemical companies 

sales of polymer solutions in asia are expected to grow longterm due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states us and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the us europe china and the middle east we are now operating two production facilities in china to deliver polymer solutions products to this rapidly growing market 

a number of customers of our polymer solutions segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical 

competition 

our polymer solutions segment serves the following geographic markets the us asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the polymer solutions marketplace 

competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers and resin systems in endproducts in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries which is why our product portfolio includes bromine and mineral chemistries that are common in over 70  of high value end uses today for other additives competition is introduced by lowcost antioxidant suppliers we offer our basic antioxidant products from low cost manufacturing sites in china 

we are a market leader in the brominated flame retardants business and our most significant competitors are chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd we are also a market leader in the mineralbased flame retardants business in our mineralbased flame retardants business our most significant competitors include jm huber corporation kyowa chemical industry co ltd and nabaltec gmbh we are a significant player in the stabilizers business and our most significant competitors are basf corporation sk capital and songwon industrial co ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our polymer solutions operations are bromine bisphenola phenol benzene caustic soda alumina trihydrate polystyrene and isobutylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

the bromine we use in our polymer solutions segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 70  years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we have a joint venture with weifang sinobrom import and export company ltd or sinobrom in china that allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 



catalysts 

our catalysts segment includes our refinery catalysts and performance catalyst solutions businesses 

refinery catalyst solutions  our two main refinery catalysts businesses are clean fuels technologies cft primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts hpc and heavy oil upgrading hou primarily composed of fluidized catalytic cracking fcc catalysts and additives hpc products are widely applied throughout the refining industry their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil products by removing sulfur nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock in addition they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes albemarle continuously seeks to add more value to refinery operations by offering hpc products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market fcc catalysts assist in the high yield cracking of less desired refinery petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene our fcc additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield such as propylene and to boost octane in gasoline albemarle offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs we offer a wide range of hpc products and approximately 60  different fcc catalysts and additives products to our customers 

performance catalyst solutions pcs  we have three business units in our pcs division polymer catalysts chemical catalysts and electronic materials we manufacture organometallic cocatalysts eg aluminum magnesium and zinc alkyls as well as metallocene components and cocatalysts eg methylaluminumoxane organoborons metallocene compounds and finished polymerization catalysts comprising these products we also offer finished singlesite catalysts with or without our proprietary activcat ®  technology and a line of proprietary zieglernatta catalysts under the advantage ™  brand our cocatalysts and finished catalysts are used in our customers’ production of polyolefin polymers such polymers are commodity ie zieglernatta polymerization technologybased and specialty ie single site polymerization technologybased plastics serving a wide variety of end markets including packaging nonpackaging films and injection molding some of our organometallic products are also used in the manufacture of alphaolefins ie hexene octene decene in electronic materials we manufacture and sell high purity metal organic products into electronic applications such as the production of light emitting diodes leds for displays and general lighting as well as other products used in the production of solar cells our chemical catalysts include a variety of catalysts used in the broad chemical industry for example catalysts used in the production of ethylene dichloride and methylamines among others 

realignment  as previously announced on september 23 2013 we realigned our operating segments effective january 1 2014 as a result of this realignment the refinery catalyst solutions and pcs businesses are aligned under the catalyst solutions segment 

customers 

our catalysts segment customers include multinational corporations such as exxonmobil corporation chevron corporation total sa saudi basic industries corporation and ineos group holdings sa independent petroleum refining companies such as valero energy corporation and sk holdings and national petroleum refining companies such as reliance petróleo brasileiro sa and petróleos mexicanos 

we estimate that there are currently approximately 500  fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3000  hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to three years there are approximately 1000  polyolefin and elastomer units worldwide which require a constant supply of cocatalysts and finished catalysts 

competition 

our catalysts segment serves the global market including the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

we are a market leader in the hpc fcc and polyolefin organometallic catalysts markets our major competitors in the hpc catalysts market include criterion catalysts and technologies advanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our 



major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co and basf corporation our major competitors in the organometallics market include akzonobel and chemtura corporation as well as wr grace  co and basf in the zieglernatta catalysts area some of our major catalysts competitors have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alphaolefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin rare earths molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility these raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility despite our mitigating efforts our profitability may be affected if we are unable to recover significant raw material costs from our customers 

fine chemistry 

our fine chemistry segment consists of two categories performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

performance chemicals  performance chemicals includes products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids mercury control paper manufacturing water purification beef and poultry processing and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides disinfectants and sanitizers and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications 

fine chemistry services and intermediates  in addition to supplying the specific fine chemistry products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs specialty materials and agrichemicals 

our most significant pharmaceutical bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

we will continue to sell methyl bromide in our current markets as regulations allow in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the us western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for “critical uses” where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by the us environmental protection agency epa the us submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol our sales of methyl bromide approximated 04 03 and 06 of our total annual net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

realignment  as previously announced on september 23 2013 we realigned our operating segments effective january 1 2014 as a result of this realignment the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product market categories are aligned under the performance chemicals segment effective january 1 2014 



customers 

our fine chemistry segment manufactures more than 100  products which are used in a variety of end markets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical and agricultural companies drilling and oil service companies beef and poultry processors water treatment and photographic companies energy producers and other specialty chemical companies 

pricing for many of our fine chemistry products and services is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process

our fine chemistry segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the fine chemistry marketplace 

we are a market leader in the brominebased product groups and primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd we are a leading producer of pharmaceutical bulk actives ie ibuprofen and propofol and we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation lonza clariant ltd and cilag ag however there is increasing competition from asian sources we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new high quality innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our fine chemistry operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alphaolefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

the bromine that we use in our fine chemistry segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 70  years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we have our sinobrom joint venture in china that allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers within north america europe the middle east india asia pacific russia africa and latin america we also use approximately 85  commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer solutions is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant 



research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles such as our greenarmor ™  flame retardant product that are greatly enhanced in both end product performance and environmental responsibility plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and valueadded plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

catalysts research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers our performance catalysts customers and developing metal organics for led and other electronic applications refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the performance catalysts area we are focused primarily on catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems for polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers as well as metal organics for electronic customers 

the primary focus of our fine chemistry research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants 

we have incurred research and development expenses of 822 million  789 million  and 771 million  during 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2013  we owned approximately 1700  active us and foreign patents and approximately 1200  pending us and foreign patent applications we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2013  with an occupational injury and illness rate of 055  for albemarle employees and nested contractors up from 023  in 2012  

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern—such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative vpvb and endocrine disruptors—will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2009 one of our products was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern under authorization hexabromocyclododecane hbcd our sales of hbcd approximated 13  19  and 21  of our total annual net sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in 2012 another of our products decabromodiphenyl ether decabde similarly was identified as a substance of very high concern our sales of decabde approximated 03 of our total annual net sales in 2013 and 07 of our total annual net sales in 2012 and 2011 in accordance with our voluntary commitment announced in 2009 albemarle ceased production of decabde effective at the end of 2012 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 



recently there has been increased scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s on page 50 



climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities the company seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted see page 15 for further discussion on climate change in item 1a risk factors 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

over the last three years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during recent years 

on october 8 2013 we announced the expansion of our presence in the electronic materials market with the acquisition of cambridge chemical company ltd effective october 1 2013 based in cambridge uk cambridge chemical is a key technology player for producing high purity metal organic chemicals used in the laser market cambridge chemical’s technology and products will further strengthen albemarle’s offerings in the electronic market including led semiconductor oled and now laser albemarle will also benefit from a number of rd and distribution synergies resulting from the acquisition 

on may 11 2011 we announced that we had expanded our presence in the biofuels market with the acquisition of catilin inc based in ames iowa 

on september 13 2010 we announced the purchase of certain property and equipment in yeosu south korea in connection with our plans for building a metallocene polyolefin catalyst and trimethyl gallium tmg manufacturing site the site will effectively mirror albemarle’s world scale metallocene polyolefin catalyst and tmg capabilities located in baton rouge louisiana commercial production of metallocene polyolefin catalysts and cocatalysts began in july 2013 and commercial production of tmg is expected to begin in august 2014 

on october 27 2009 we entered into an agreement with saudi specialty chemicals company an affiliate of saudi basic industries corporation sabic to form a joint venture called saudi organometallic chemicals company socc under the terms of the joint venture agreement the two parent companies have built a worldscale organometallics production facility strategically located in the arabian gulf industrial city of aljubail this facility is now operational and available for full commercial production once customer qualifications are completed 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had 4231  employees of whom 2148  or 51  are employed in the us 1152  or 27  are employed in europe 590  or 14  are employed in asia and 341  or 8  are employed in the middle east approximately 14  of our us employees are unionized we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations 

 we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than 20 years bargaining agreements expire at our pasadena texas location in 2014 our baton rouge louisiana location in 2015 and our orangeburg south carolina location in 2016 

we have two works councils representing the majority of our european sites—amsterdam the netherlands and bergheim germany—covering approximately 900  employees we believe that we have a generally good relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives 



during 2013 we recorded workforce reduction charges of approximately 334 million in connection with the realignment of our operating segments effective january 1 2014 which will result in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide in 2014 during 2012 we recorded workforce reduction charges of approximately 216 million in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business whose products were sourced mainly at our avonmouth united kingdom and nanjing china manufacturing sites

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

in the us the uncertainty regarding government shutdowns and threatened shutdowns significant mandated tax increases government debt ceiling limitations sequestration and government spending cuts and budget negotiations pose a serious risk for the us economy and consumer confidence in the event that the us federal government is unable to achieve a resolution of these issues there could be an adverse impact on the us economy which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in the pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 



we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make false or unsubstantiated claims implies immoral or improper conduct or is otherwise disparaging to our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 



our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example we are experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian producers and our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more costeffective catalysts products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or 



otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we and our joint ventures currently have 34 facilities located outside the us including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany hungary india italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cancellation of those capital projects which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi brazilian real and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future with respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations for the year ended december 31 2013  approximately 26  of our net sales were denominated in such currencies significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency 



denominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there has been increasing concern regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change for example some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions potentially additional us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co 2  andor “cap and trade” legislation that could have impacts on our operations in addition we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an 



international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfcc which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 an amendment was passed by the unfcc during the december 2012 doha climate change talks that would implement a second commitment period through 2020 but the amendment has not entered into legal force pending acceptance by participating countries the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities fees or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect us 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

over the past decade there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

in 2009 one of our products hbcd was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern in february 2011 the european union included hbcd on a list of substances published under annex xiv of the reach regulation our expectation is that the sale of hbcd could be banned in europe under the reach process as early as august 2015 or by 2019 assuming certain applications are authorized during a period of transition to alternative products also in august 2013 the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops banned hbcd under the convention effective november 2014 with certain uses exempted to allow time for the development of alternative products a number of countries may ban hbcd immediately in november 2014 allowing for no period of transition thereby eliminating sales of hbcd in such countries our sales of hbcd approximated 13  19  and 21  of our total annual net sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively there is no assurance that we will be able to develop alternative products in the future that generate sales comparable to hbcd 

agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 



our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we continually assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2013  we had 4231  employees approximately 14  of our 2148  us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2014 2015 and 2016 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage 



slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us the netherlands germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 93  of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2011 we made voluntary contributions of 500 million to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans under the pension protection act of 2006 we anticipate no required cash contributions during 2014 for our us qualified defined benefit pension plans additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2014  may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 



the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our february 2014 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our february 2014 credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pa ge 47 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our february 2014 credit agreement and our commercial paper program bear interest at floating rates the rates under the february 2014 credit agreement are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services sp and moody’s investors services moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa1 sp has rated our commercial paper as a2 and moody’s has rated it as p2 sp andor moody’s may downgrade our ratings in the future the downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings 



changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

the instruments governing our indebtedness do not limit our acquisitions and may allow us to incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness in relation to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement and expand our distribution network the terms of our indebtedness do not limit the number or scale of acquisitions that we may complete because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy

overview and outlook 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that meet customer needs across an exceptionally diverse range of end markets including the petroleum refining consumer electronics plasticspackaging construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection food safety and custom chemistry services markets we are committed to global sustainability and are advancing responsible ecopractices and solutions in our three business segments we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible low cost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts ongoing productivity improvements and strong balance sheet will position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging economic environment 



through 2013 our operations were managed and reported as three operating segments polymer solutions catalysts and fine chemistry financial results and discussion about our operating segments included in this annual report on form 10k are categorized according to these three operating segments except where noted 

as previously announced on september 23 2013 we realigned our operating segments effective january 1 2014 the performance chemicals segment will include fire safety solutions specialty chemicals and fine chemistry services consolidating our bromine mineral and custom manufacturing assets under one business unit the catalyst solutions segment will include refinery catalyst solutions performance catalyst solutions and antioxidants each segment will have a dedicated team of sales research and development process engineering manufacturing and sourcing and business strategy personnel that will have full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus agility and responsiveness the new structure will also facilitate the continued standardization of business processes across the organization as part of our ongoing one albemarle strategy 

2013 highlights

outlook 

the 2013 business environment presented a diverse set of challenges in the markets we serve from a slow global economic recovery significant pricing pressure on bromine and an everchanging landscape in electronics to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery partners despite these continuing challenges our business fundamentals are sound and we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes managing costs and delivering value to our customers we believe that when the end markets we serve begin to stabilize and resume growth our businesses will be ready to respond quickly to the improved market conditions and new business opportunities 

polymer solutions  yearoveryear results for 2013 on both the top and bottom line are a reflection of the difficult pricing environment for our portfolio of flame retardants but we did enjoy midsingledigit volume growth for both mineral and brominated flame retardants we continue to manage through an uncertain environment characterized by soft demand in certain products and applications and cautious inventory management by our customers which could continue to challenge the growth curve of this business into 2014 

despite these current trends and concerns we believe that the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our competitive position product innovations and effective management of raw material inventory inflation will enable us to manage our business through these periods of end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that will come with a sustained economic recovery our view of third party market indicators and order book trends makes us cautiously optimistic that broad pricing trends for brominated flame retardants have stabilized 

on a longterm basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products further the demand environment for antioxidants both polymer and lubes and fuel segments continues to grow with new polyolefin plants in china the us and the middle east expected to support strong demand growth for several years forward based on current production capacities and end market demand we remain wellpositioned for the future 

catalysts  lower metals surcharges unfavorable foreign currency effects and unfavorable mix in refinery catalysts sales have resulted in overall lower yearoveryear net sales for our catalysts segment during 2013 however sales volumes in our refinery catalysts businesses were strong as compared to 2012 and are a good indication of the healthy global demand for these products in 2013 we executed several initiatives that strengthened our competitive position and laid the foundation for greater innovation and organic growth going forward as we successfully started up a polyolefin catalyst center in south korea and a world class aluminum alkyls facility in saudi arabia within our previously announced joint venture there these new units while unlikely to reach high utilization rates for a few years are stateoftheart units designed using the best technology and benefiting from our many years of handson operating experience 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for petroleum products and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refinery catalysts business in addition we expect growth in our pcs division 



to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending particularly in asia and the middle east as well as from the led market driven by energy efficiency demands 

delivering superior enduse performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry and our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world those managing new contaminants present in north america tight oil and those in the middle east and asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields 

fine chemistry  in our fine chemistry segment yearoveryear results were down in a difficult bromine pricing environment record volumes and revenue in clear completion fluids was offset by higher fixed costs related to our capacity expansion in jordan which we expect to strengthen our competitive position in the markets we serve we believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on the two strategic areas in our fine chemistry segment—maximizing our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and continued growth of our fine chemistry services business 

on a longer term basis we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap will tighten as demand for existing and new uses of bromine expand after an exceptional twoyear run clear completion fluids are expected to grow at a healthy rate factors that could cause a decline in the trajectory of this business include a continuation of the recent destocking and well completion delays that we observed late in 2013 or a meaningful decline in oil prices or increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling which could lead to delays in deep water and ultradeep water spending 

fine chemistry services has a solid pipeline and good growth in contracts linked to electronic materials and agricultural applications and although we expect the near term trajectory of growth in this business to be challenging due to the conclusion of several major projects we expect new projects to offset these losses and establish a foundation for future growth our technical expertise manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop a preferred outsourcing position serving leading chemical agrochemical and life science innovators in diverse industries we believe we will continue to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other  we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies our global effective tax rate was 250  for 2013  and we expect our global effective tax rate for 2014  to be approximately 250  however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions 

actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligations are reflected in corporate and other as a component of nonoperating pension and opeb plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2013  include an actuarial gain of 1390 million   883 million  after income taxes as compared to a loss of 757 million   482 million  after income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012  

in the first quarter of 2013 we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 024 per share we repurchased approximately 92 million shares of our common stock during 2013 for approximately 582 million under our existing share repurchase program and the 2013 asr program and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis in the first quarter of 2014 we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase 50 million of of our common stock by the end of april 2014 also in the first quarter of 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 0275  per share 

we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint additional information regarding our products markets and financial performance is provided at our web site wwwalbemarlecom  our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference

for the year ended december 31 2013  we recorded net sales of 262 billion  a 5   decrease  compared to net sales of 275 billion  for the corresponding period of 2012  this decrease  was due primarily to unfavorable pricing impacts of 6 mainly lower metals surcharges in refinery catalyst solutions lower price mix in overall catalysts lower regional pricing on bromine and derivatives and lower flame retardant pricing partly offset by favorable volume impacts of 2 driven by higher volumes in refinery catalysts flame retardants and additives net of lower volumes in fine chemistry services and the unfavorable volume impacts from our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business in 2012 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2013  our gross profit decreased   486 million  or 5  from the corresponding 2012  period due mainly to overall unfavorable pricing impacts unfavorable currency impacts mainly from a weaker japanese yen and higher manufacturing costs these were partly offset by favorable impacts from lower variable input costs and favorable 



overall volumes additionally our gross profit for 2013  was impacted by approximately 422 million  of pension and opeb benefits including marktomarket actuarial gains allocated to cost of goods sold as compared to 263 million of pension and opeb costs allocated to cost of goods sold in 2012  pension and opeb costs included in cost of goods sold for 2012 include a correction of 35 million  for actuarial gains that relate to 2011 overall these factors contributed to our gross profit margin of 329  for the current year down from 331  in 2012

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2013  our rd expenses increased   33 million  or 4  from the year ended december 31 2012  as a result of higher expenses for services as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 31  in 2013  compared to 29  in 2012  

restructuring and other charges net 

in connection with the announced realignment of our operating segments effective january 1 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a workforce reduction plan which will result in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide we recorded charges of 334 million  219 million after income taxes during the year ended december 31 2013 for termination benefits and other costs related to this workforce reduction plan 

restructuring and other charges net were 1117 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 and included the following items 

 32 



interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2013   decreased   12 million  to 316 million  from the corresponding 2012  period due mainly to lower interest rates on variablerate borrowings partially offset by higher levels of variablerate debt in 2013 

other expenses income net 

other expenses income net for the year ended december 31 2013  was 69 million  versus 12 million  for the corresponding 2012  period this change was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts compared to the corresponding period in 2012

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 317 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 381 million  in the same period last year this decrease was due primarily to overall lower equity income amounts reported from our catalysts segment joint ventures including unfavorable currency translation impacts of 24 million due to a weaker japanese yen and brazilian real partly offset by higher equity income amounts reported from our polymer solutions joint venture magnifin 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2013  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 267 million  compared to 186 million  in the same period last year this increase  of 81 million  was due primarily to higher overall profits and a contractuallybased reduction in our share of profits of 66 million in our joint venture in jordan 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation increased  to 4132 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  from 3115 million  for the corresponding period of 2012  primarily due to higher sales volumes lower sga expenses including favorable impacts from pension and opeb items lower restructuring and other charges and favorable overall variable input costs these impacts were partly offset by lower pricing including impacts from both volatility in metals surcharges and related cost impacts in refinery catalyst solutions particularly rare earths and in certain products in our bromine portfolio and flame retardants unfavorable manufacturing costs net of favorable impacts from pension and opeb items lower equity in net income of unconsolidated investments higher rd expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impacts

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets  we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes  we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities  we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included 



in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2013  and concluded there was no impairment as of that date 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five  to forty  years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 53 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are recorded on a quarterly basis the marketrelated value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement 

during 2013  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on assets and mortality scales we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we consider expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for 2013  the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by milliman which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate we believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred 



methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2013  measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we relied on aon hewitt methods including the aon hewitt topquartile and a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aagraded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 

at december 31 2013  the weightedaverage discount rate was increased for the pension plans from 404  to 500  and for the opeb plans from 400  to 503  to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2013  measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2013  and 2012  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 725  and 825  respectively the weightedaverage expected rate of return on us pension plan assets is 691  effective january 1 2014  the weightedaverage expected rate of return on plan assets for our opeb plans was 700  during 2013  and 2012  there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on opeb plan assets effective january 1 2014  our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 and benefit accruals will be frozen effective december 31 2014 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 which was expanded to include all nonrepresented employees effective january 1 2013 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2013  the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 278  from 337  for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 350  for the opeb plans at december 31 2013  and 2012 

at december 31 2013  the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 were met starting january 1 2013 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 



 not applicable 

of the 6222 million  total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2013  1236 million  or approximately 20  are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 17 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 53 



income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by tax authorities for years prior to 2010 since the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 and our statute of limitations has expired for 2008 and 2009 except for the amount of any carryforward to 2010 we also are no longer subject to any us state income tax audits prior to 2004 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006 during 2013 the german tax authorities continued the audit of two of our german subsidiaries for 2006 through 2009 that began in 2011 and the chinese tax authorities completed an audit of one of our chinese subsidiaries for 2006 through 2010 that began in 2011 during 2011 we completed tax audits for one of our belgian companies for 2008 and 2009 our japanese company for 2006 through 2010 and two of our chinese companies through 2010 no significant tax was assessed as a result of the completed audits 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 28 million  as a result of closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards restricted stock unit awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 



internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on form 10k our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting status and updates are provided to executive management and our audit and finance committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business and functional groups we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments funding working capital and repayment of debt we also make contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 4772 million  at december 31 2013  as compared to 4777 million  at december 31 2012  cash provided by operating activities was 4329 million  4888 million  and 4874 million  during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 versus 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from our businesses offset by lower pension contributions and higher deferred income taxes cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was essentially flat versus 2011 with favorable impacts from lower pension contributions in 2012 being offset mainly by unfavorable impacts from lower profitability in 2012 

during 2013 proceeds from borrowings net of repayments cash on hand and cash provided by operations funded payments of 5823 million  for repurchases of our common stock capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1553 million  dividends to shareholders of 781 million  and pension and postretirement contributions of 133 million  additionally during 2013 our consolidated joint venture jbc paid a dividend of approximately 38 million which resulted in a dividend to noncontrolling interests of 100 million in 2012 cash on hand and cash from operations funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 2809 million 225 million in loans to our 50owned joint venture socc repayments of debt net of borrowings of 638 million repurchases of shares of our common stock of 636 million dividends to shareholders of 691 million and 91 million in withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation amounts distributed during the period in 2011 our operating cash flows funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1906 million repurchases of common stock of 1781 million dividends to shareholders of 578 million and 1002 million of repayments of debt net of borrowings during the year 

net current assets increased to approximately 105 billion  at december 31 2013  from 102 billion  at december 31 2012  the increase in net current assets was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories partly offset by increases in accounts payable accrued expenses and the current portion of longterm debt 



capital expenditures were 1553 million  2809 million  and 1906 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 130 million in 2014  for capacity increases cost reduction and continuity of operations projects 

we made contributions to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans of 133 million  216 million  and 598 million  during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively included in contributions for the year ended december 31 2012 is a contribution of 141 million to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman 

on february 12 2013 our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under its existing share repurchase program to 15 million from 39 million shares that remained outstanding under the program as of december 31 2012 under the existing board authorized share repurchase program on may 9 2013 the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with jpmorgan relating to a fixeddollar uncollared accelerated share repurchase program pursuant to the terms of the agreement on may 10 2013 the company paid 450 million to jpmorgan and received an initial delivery of 5680921 shares with a fair market value of approximately 360 million this purchase was funded through a combination of available cash on hand and debt under the terms of the agreement on december 19 2013 the transaction was completed and we received a final settlement of 1384011 shares calculated based on the daily rule 10b18 volumeweighted average prices of the company’s common stock over the term of the agreement less a forward price adjustment amount of approximately 101 

on february 3 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with merrill lynch international “merrill lynch” acting through its agent merrill lynch pierce fenner and smith incorporated relating to a fixeddollar uncollared accelerated share repurchase program pursuant to which we will purchase 50 million of our shares from merrill lynch the shares will be purchased by merrill lynch in two 25 million tranches that may be settled separately or simultaneously on february 3 2014 we paid 50 million to merrill lynch and received an initial delivery of 623248 shares of our common stock with a fair market value of approximately 40 million this purchase was funded with cash on hand the total number of shares to ultimately be purchased under the agreement will be determined at the completion of the trade and will generally be based on the daily rule 10b18 volumeweighted average prices of the company’s common stock over the term of the agreement less a forward price adjustment amount of approximately 077 final settlement may be accelerated and the number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement may be adjusted upon the announcement or occurrence of certain corporate events including without limitation tender offers delisting merger events or insolvency the agreement will be terminated at any time that our share price is at or below 30 per share no more than 15 million shares can be repurchased under this program and this program is expected to be completed by the end of april 2014 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we and our joint venture partner each advanced 225 million to our 50owned joint venture socc pursuant to a longterm loan arrangement the proceeds under this arrangement are for the construction of socc’s aluminum alkyls manufacturing facility our loan bears quarterly interest at the libor plus 1275 per annum  152  as of december 31 2013  with interest receivable on a semiannual basis on january 1 and july 1 principal repayments on amounts outstanding under this arrangement are required as mutually agreed upon by the joint venture partners but with any outstanding balances receivable in full no later than december 31 2021 also during the year ended december 31 2012 we and our joint venture partner each advanced approximately 19 million euros approximately 26 million  at december 31 2013  to our 50owned joint venture eurecat sa pursuant to a longterm loan arrangement 

on february 25 2014  we increased our quarterly dividend rate to 0275  per share a 15  increase from the quarterly rate of 024  per share paid in 2013 

in connection with the announced realignment of our operating segments effective january 1 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a workforce reduction plan which will result in a reduction of approximately 230 employees worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded charges of 334 million 219 million after income taxes for termination benefits and other costs related to this workforce reduction plan payments under this workforce reduction plan are expected to occur through 2014 we do not anticipate a significant reduction in future operating expenses as a result of the workforce reduction because we plan to redeploy resources to research and development sales and business development in support of our strategic objectives to more rapidly develop and commercialize new applications for bromine protect and grow our flame retardants business and more aggressively expand our catalyst business into new markets 

in 2012 we recorded net charges amounting to 1008 million 761 million after income taxes in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business we began to realize favorable profit impacts from this program in the fourth quarter of 2012 and we expect to fund the remaining obligations associated with these charges approximately 9 million with cash generated from our ongoing operations 



at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  our cash and cash equivalents included 3883 million  and 3193 million  respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are permanently reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be permanently reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we repatriated approximately 72 million  706 million  and 985 million  in cash respectively as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy we are optimistic that in 2014  we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our february 2014 credit agreement and our commercial paper program the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have outstanding 3250 million of 510 senior notes due in 2015 and 3500 million of 450 senior notes due in 2020 or the senior notes the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the treasury rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2015 and 25 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2020 plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption however the 2020 senior notes are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time on or after three months prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption holders of the 2020 senior notes may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the related indenture 

the principal amounts of the senior notes become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 

in anticipation of refinancing our 2015 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2014 on january 22 2014 we entered into a pay fixed receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swap with jp morgan chase bank na to be effective october 15 2014 under this swap we hedged the interest rate and partial credit spread on the 20 future semiannual coupon payments that we would pay when we refinance our 2015 senior notes with another 10 year note the notional amount of the swap is 3250 million and the fixed rate is 3281 a cash settlement will occur on the termination date determined by reference to the changes in the us dollar 3month libor and credit spreads from the date we entered into the swap until the date we terminate the swap we intend to designate this derivative financial instrument as an effective hedge under accounting standards codification 815 derivatives and hedging  

on february 7 2014 we entered into a new 7500 million credit facility the fiveyear revolving unsecured credit agreement the february 2014 credit agreement matures on february 7 2019 and i replaces our previous 7500 million amended and restated credit agreement the september 2011 credit agreement dated as of september 22 2011 ii provides for an additional 2500 million in credit if needed subject to the terms of the agreement and iii provides for the ability to extend the maturity date under certain conditions borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0900 to 1500 depending on the company’s credit rating from sp and moody’s the applicable margin on the facility was 1000 as of february 25 2014 there were no 



borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement as of february 25 2014 and there were no borrowings outstanding under the september 2011 credit agreement as of december 31 2013  

borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants i consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items or herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter ii with the exception of liens specified in our new credit facility liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the february 2014 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and iii with the exception of indebtedness specified in the february 2014 credit agreement subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement 

on may 29 2013 we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes the “notes” from timetotime up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of 750 million the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are expected to be 

used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of other debt of the company our february 2014 credit agreement is available to repay the notes if necessary aggregate borrowings outstanding under the february 2014 credit agreement and the commercial paper program will not exceed the 750 million current maximum amount available under the february 2014 credit agreement the notes will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of the issuance of the notes the maturities of the notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue the definitive documents relating to the program contain customary representations warranties default and indemnification provisions 

at december 31 2013  we had 3630 million  of notes outstanding bearing a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 023  and a weightedaverage maturity of 21 days  while the outstanding notes generally have shortterm maturities we classify the notes as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance the notes on a longterm basis through the issuance of additional notes or borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 11 billion  at december 31 2013  compared to 6866 million  at december 31 2012  the increase is mainly attributable to the issuance of the commercial paper notes noted above in addition at december 31 2013  we had the ability to borrow 3870 million  under our commercial paper program and the september 2011 credit agreement and 2338 million  under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our september 2011 credit agreement as noted above on february 7 2014 we replaced the september 2011 credit agreement with a new 7500 million credit facility with substantially similar terms referred to as the february 2014 credit agreement we have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the february 2014 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt we believe that as of december 31 2013  we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 266 million  at december 31 2013  none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 



other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for capital projects various take or pay and throughput agreements longterm debt operating leases and other commitments as of december 31 2013  in thousands 



 amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our serp are expected to approximate 5 million  in 2014  we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we made contributions of 98 million  to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified during the year ended december 31 2013  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 298 million  and 292 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 257 million  and 258 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

in anticipation of refinancing our 2015 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2014 on january 22 2014 we entered into a pay fixed receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swap with jp morgan chase bank na to be effective october 15 2014 under this swap we hedged the interest rate and partial credit spread on the 20 future semiannual coupon payments that we would pay when we refinance our 2015 senior notes with another 10 year note the notional amount of the swap is 3250 million and the fixed rate is 3281 a cash settlement will occur on the termination date determined by reference to the changes in the us dollar 3month libor and credit spreads from the date we entered into the swap until the date we terminate the swap 

on february 3 2014 we paid 50 million to merrill lynch in connection with an accelerated share repurchase agreement that we entered into with merrill lynch on that date for additional details about this transaction see cash flow  above 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities including goals to reduce working capital by 100 million over two years and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make pension contributions and pay dividends for the 



foreseeable future in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the corporate bond and debt markets remain strong volatility has increased in all capital markets over the past few years during times of uncertainty such as european sovereign debt and us budget concerns if these concerns heighten we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature in addition our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability when the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

at december 31 2013  we had the ability to borrow approximately 621 million  subject to the leverage covenant under our september 2011 credit agreement on february 7 2014 we replaced our september 2011 credit agreement with a new 7500 million credit facility with substantially similar terms referred to as the february 2014 credit agreement with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant debt maturities before 2015 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 4772 million  as of december 31 2013  of which 3883 million  is held by our foreign subsidiaries this cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities substantially all of this cash is held and intended for use outside of the us we anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the us in excess of our cash held in the us can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing us credit facilities or our commercial paper program 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 440 million  390 million  and 354 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2013  totaled approximately 166 million  a decrease  of 37 million  from 203 million  at december 31 2012  during the second quarter of 2012 the company recorded 87 million in estimated site remediation liabilities at our avonmouth united kingdom site as part of the charges associated with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardant business 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum 



could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 “legal proceedings” on p age 23 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 141 million  254 million  and 161 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting guidance that requires entities to disclose information about financial instruments including derivatives and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement in january 2013 the fasb issued additional guidance that limits the scope of these new requirements to certain derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions these amendments became effective on january 1 2013 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance that requires companies to present either in a single note or on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety companies would instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information these amendments became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2013 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance that requires entities that have obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements and for which the total amount is fixed at the reporting date to measure such obligations as the sum of a the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its coobligors and b any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its coobligors entities are also required to disclose the nature amount and any other relevant information about such obligations this accounting guidance will become effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for obligations that exist at the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year of adoption we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance that clarifies a parent company’s accounting for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment when the parent sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity the guidance clarifies that the sale of an investment in a foreign entity includes both a events that result in the loss of a controlling financial interest in a foreign entity and b events that result in an acquirer obtaining control of an acquiree in which it held an equity interest immediately before the acquisition date sometimes also referred to as a step acquisition accordingly the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment should be released into net income upon the occurrence of those events this accounting guidance will become effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 and should be applied prospectively to derecognition events occurring after the effective date the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements will depend upon the nature terms and size of derecognition events if any that may occur in the future related to any of our foreign entities 

in july 2013 the fasb issued accounting guidance designed to reduce diversity in practice of financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists these new requirements become effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi brazilian real and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 3214 million  and with a fair value representing a net asset position of 02 million  at december 31 2013  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are intended to offset the changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2013  with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease  of approximately 164 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase  of approximately 120 million  in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2013  without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 3979 million  and 70 million  outstanding at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively these borrowings represented 37  and 1  of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 030  and 174  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 3  basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 01 million  as of december 31 2013  we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations

fine chemistry 

our fine chemistry formerly fine chemicals segment consists of two categories performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

performance chemicals performance chemicals include products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids mercury control paper manufacturing water purification beef and poultry processing and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides disinfectants and sanitizers potassiumbased products used in industrial applications alkenyl succinic anhydride used in papersizing formulations and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications we sell these products to customers throughout the world for use in personal care products automotive insulation foundry bricks and other industrial products 

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemistry products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs specialty materials and chemicals from renewables 

our most significant pharmaceutical bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

we will continue to sell methyl bromide in our current markets as regulations allow in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the us western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for “critical uses” where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by the us environmental protection agency epa the us submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

customers 

our fine chemistry segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of end markets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical and agricultural companies drilling and oil service companies beef and poultry processors water treatment and photographic companies energy producers and other specialty chemical companies 

pricing for many of our fine chemistry products and services is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

competition 

our fine chemistry segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the fine chemistry marketplace 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our fine chemistry operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alphaolefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

the bromine that we use in our fine chemistry segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we have our sinobrom joint venture in china that allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers within north america europe the middle east india asia pacific russia africa and latin america we also use approximately 90 selected distributors commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer solutions is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles such as our newly commercialized greenarmor tm flame retardant product that are greatly enhanced in both end product performance and environmental responsibility plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and valueadded plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

catalysts research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers our performance catalysts customers and developing metal organics for led and other electronic applications refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the performance catalysts area we are focused primarily on catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems for polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers as well as metal organics for electronic customers 

the primary focus of our fine chemistry research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants 

we have recognized research and development expenses of 789 million 771 million and 584 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2012 we owned approximately 1700 active us and foreign patents and approximately 1400 pending us and foreign patent applications we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2012 with an occupational injury and illness rate of 023 for albemarle employees and nested contractors down from 029 in 2011 

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the european community regulation for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern—such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative vpvb and endocrine disruptors—will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2009 one of our products was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern under authorization hexabromocyclododecane hbcd our sales of hbcd approximated 19 21 and 12 of our total annual net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in 2012 another of our products decabromodiphenyl ether decabde similarly was nominated as a substance of very high concern our sales of decabde approximated 07 07 and 11 of our total annual net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in accordance with our voluntary commitment announced in 2009 albemarle ceased production of decabde effective at the end of 2012 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 

recently there has been increased scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 48 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities the company seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as renewable fuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted see page 15 for further discussion on climate change in item 1a risk factors

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

over the last three years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during recent years 

on may 11 2011 we announced that we had expanded our presence in the biofuels market with the acquisition of catilin inc based in ames iowa 

on december 6 2010 we announced that we had signed a memorandum of understanding to build a worldscale hpc production plant on the site of our existing joint venture fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa fcc sa in santa cruz brazil with petrobras the new facility will complement existing production of fcc catalysts we are also further enhancing our partnership with petrobras by engaging in a joint technical cooperation aimed at the further development of advanced hpc products mirroring our very successful existing cooperation in the area of fcc catalysts 

on september 13 2010 we announced the purchase of certain property and equipment in yeosu south korea in connection with our plans for building a metallocene polyolefin catalyst and trimethyl gallium tmg manufacturing site the site will effectively mirror albemarle’s world scale metallocene polyolefin catalyst and tmg capabilities located in baton rouge louisiana production of metallocene polyolefin catalysts and cocatalysts is expected to begin in the first half of 2013 and production of tmg is expected to begin in late 2013 

on october 27 2009 we entered into an agreement with ibn hayyan plastic products company tayf an affiliate of saudi basic industries corporation sabic to form a joint venture called saudi organometallic chemicals company socc under the terms of the joint venture agreement the two parent companies will build a worldscale organometallics production facility strategically located in the arabian gulf industrial city of aljubail this facility is expected to be operational in early 2013 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had 4304 employees of whom 2156 or 50 are employed in the us 1150 or 27 are employed in europe 613 or 14 are employed in asia and 385 or 9 are employed in the middle east approximately 17 of our us employees are unionized we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations 

 

  

  

 we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than 19 years bargaining agreements expire at our orangeburg south carolina location in 2013 our pasadena texas location in 2014 and our baton rouge louisiana location in 2015 

we have two works councils representing the majority of our european sites—amsterdam the netherlands and bergheim germany—covering approximately 900 employees in addition we have approximately 14 employees at our manufacturing facility in avonmouth united kingdom that are represented by unions through a current collective bargaining agreement we believe that we have a generally good relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives during 2012 we recorded workforce reduction charges of approximately 216 million in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business whose products were sourced mainly at our avonmouth united kingdom and nanjing china manufacturing sites during 2010 approximately 66 million of workforce reduction charges were recorded related to a restructuring program at our bergheim germany location

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

in the us absent further congressional action an automatic reduction in federal spending or “sequestration” is to be triggered pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 which combined with the expiration of certain tax cuts on december 31 2012 has typically been known as the “fiscal cliff” while congress did agree to a package of tax and federal spending proposals in january 2013 these did not eliminate the “sequestration” threat but moved it back to march 1 2013 if congress resolves the fiscal cliff through changes within the corporate tax structure this could result in an increase of our effective tax rate which could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows moreover if the us federal reserve bank decided to tighten monetary supply in response to congressional action or inaction regarding the fiscal cliff we may incur increased borrowing costs as our interest rates could increase on our variable rate credit facilities when our various credit facilities mature or when we refinance maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in the pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility could adversely affect our margins in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

albemarle’s brands product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the company’s reputation accordingly the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make false or unsubstantiated claims implies immoral or improper conduct or is otherwise disparaging to our company or its products further our own actions could hurt such brands product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example our fine chemistry segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian producers in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more costeffective catalysts products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes redesign our products partially or completely pay to use the technology of others stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we and our joint ventures currently have 34 facilities located outside the us including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany hungary india italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture a delay or cancellation of those capital projects and negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities water shortages significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures among others for example there has been increasing concern regarding the declining water level of the dead sea from which our joint venture jbc produces bromine a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change for example some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions potentially some form of us federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co 2  andor “cap and trade” legislation in addition we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol expired in 2012 a successor global policy framework is under negotiation the doha climate change talks but is not yet accepted by all countries the outcome of new legislation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional regulation additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or restrictions on certain activities while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations even without such regulation increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect us 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available

recently there has been increased scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

in 2009 one of our products hbcd was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern in february 2011 the european union included hbcd on a list of substances published under annex xiv of the reach regulation our expectation is that the sale of hbcd could be banned in europe under the reach process in 2015 also the persistent organic pollutants review committee a scientific body to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops recommended in october 2012 that hbcd be banned under the convention with certain uses exempted to allow time for the development of alternative products our sales of hbcd approximated 19 21 and 12 of our total annual net sales in 2012 2012 and 2010 respectively 

in 2012 another one of our products decabde similarly was nominated in europe as a substance of very high concern our sales of decabde approximated 07 07 and 11 of our total annual net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in accordance with our voluntary commitment announced in 2009 albemarle ceased production of decabde effective at the end of 2012 

agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol a and decabromodiphenylethane both of which we manufacture additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we continually assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2012 we had 4304 employees approximately 17 of our 2156 us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2013 2014 and 2015 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include

 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us the netherlands germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 94 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2011 and 2010 we made voluntary contributions of 500 million and 700 million to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans respectively we anticipate that the funded status of each of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans will be 100 in 2013 and therefore the plans should not be subject to benefit limitations in conjunction with the pension protection act of 2006 additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2013 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as a result we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities which increase our overhead expenses 

we are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on a weighted average interest rate of 47 and outstanding borrowings at december 31 2012 of 6993 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 329 million a hypothetical 10 increase in the average interest rate applicable to the variable portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by less than 01 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our september 2011 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our september 2011 credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 45 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our september 2011 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa1 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our september 2011 credit agreement 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt is partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

the instruments governing our indebtedness do not limit our acquisitions and may allow us to incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness in relation to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement and expand our distribution network the terms of our indebtedness do not limit the number or scale of acquisitions that we may complete because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 3 2006 we received a notice of violation the 2006 nov from the us environmental protection agency region 4 or epa regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg south carolina the alleged violations involve i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant in the second quarter of 2011 the company was served with a complaint by the epa in the us district court for the district of south carolina based on the alleged violations set out in the 2006 nov seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief the complaint was subsequently amended to add the state of south carolina as a plaintiff we intend to vigorously defend this action any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines penalties capital expenditures or some combination thereof at this time it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of this litigation or the financial impact which may result therefrom however we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund products liability breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation where appropriate we may establish financial reserves as estimated by our general counsel for such proceedings we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

overview and outlook 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals that meet customer needs across an exceptionally diverse range of end markets including the petroleum refining consumer electronics plasticspackaging construction automotive lubricants pharmaceuticals crop protection food safety and custom chemistry services markets we are committed to global sustainability and are advancing responsible ecopractices and solutions in our three business segments we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise innovative capability flexible low cost global manufacturing base experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio broad geographic presence and customerfocused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace we believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts ongoing productivity improvements and strong balance sheet will position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging economic environment

 outlook 

uncertainty regarding the condition of the global economy prevailed over much of 2012 and we expect these uncertainties to continue into 2013 we continue to monitor the economic indicators that generally forecast demand in the end markets that we serve some of these key indicators deteriorated in the third quarter of 2012 particularly in the electronics and european construction sectors and signaled the continued slowing over the second half of 2012 which adversely impacted our top line performance as well as our profitability as we ran our production assets at rates lower than recent levels despite these current trends our business fundamentals are sound and we are strategically wellpositioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes managing costs and delivering value to our customers we believe that when the end markets we serve begin to stabilize and resume growth our businesses will be ready to respond quickly to the improved market conditions and new business opportunities 

polymer solutions yearoveryear volume softness unfavorably impacted our net sales and profitability for 2012 versus the corresponding period of 2011 which we believe was attributable to end market response to continuing global economic challenges we are closely monitoring customer order patterns and other key indicators in our business during this period some of which show trends that indicate the current pace of business could continue into 2013 these trends should they continue will likely have adverse impacts on our net sales and profitability into 2013 including impacts from operating our production assets below optimum levels 

despite these current trends and concerns we believe that the combination of solid longterm business fundamentals with our competitive position product innovations and effective management of raw material inventory inflation will enable our business to manage through these periods of end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that will come with a sustained economic recovery further we believe our position has been strengthened by our recent exit from the phosphorus flame retardants business which should yield improvements in our future profitability 

on a longterm basis we continue to believe that improving global standards of living and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products further we continue to focus on globalization in this segment with our antioxidants facilities in china positioning us well for growth in the asia region although we have elected to delay the expansion of our flame retardant production capacity at our jbc joint venture in safi jordan based on current bromine balances and end market demand we remain wellpositioned to meet future demand as global economic growth and global bromine supplydemand dynamics warrant the resumption of this expansion 

catalysts lower metals surcharges and unfavorable foreign currency effects have resulted in overall lower yearoveryear net sales for our catalysts segment during 2012 however the longrunning global trends driving fundamental demand for refinery and polymer catalysts remain strong we have seen significant declines in metals surcharges especially rare earths relative to levels in 2011 as a result of these declines our fcc business faced significant headwinds toward achieving net sales performance comparable with 2011 as well as unfavorable profitability impacts which we believe will continue through the first half of 2013 however our volumes in refinery catalysts mainly hpc and in our pcs division finished 2012 with solid performance to partially offset these headwinds and will position us for continued growth in 2013 

on a longer term basis we believe increased global demand for petroleum products and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our refinery catalysts business in addition we expect growth in our pcs division to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending particularly in asia and the middle east as well as from the led market driven by energy efficiency demands 

new market penetration and introduction of innovative costeffective products for the refining and polyolefins industries continue to provide benefits we believe our focus on advanced product development in catalysts positions us well for commercial success and we have introduced new valueadded refining solutions and technologies that enable refiners to increase yields a critical advantage for refiners as well as offering advanced zieglernatta catalysts to our polyolefin customers our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned enabling us to continue to bring innovative technologies to the market 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we expect to leverage our existing positions in the middle east and asia to capitalize on growth opportunities and further develop our leading position in those emerging markets our joint venture in saudi arabia with sabic expected to be operational in early 2013 positions us to lead in the fastgrowing middle east polyolefins catalysts market construction at our yeosu south korea site is progressing well where lab and pilot plant assets have allowed us to rapidly develop research and smallscale production facilities adding immediate value to the metallocene polyolefin markets the commercial facility is expected to be operational in the first half of 2013 to meet regional growth in metallocene polyolefins markets 

fine chemistry in our fine chemistry segment we saw positive yearoveryear net sales and income growth overall during 2012 as a result of volume growth primarily in custom services and in performance chemicals this segment continues to benefit from the rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions we believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on the two strategic areas in our fine chemistry segment—maximizing our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and continued growth of our fine chemistry services business 

in our performance chemicals sector our completion fluids business showed signs of strengthening drilling activity during the second half of 2012 especially in the us gulf of mexico and in the middle east additionally we remain encouraged by longterm regulatory drivers in the us and by the recent agreement among parties to the unep minamata convention to move forward with globally binding standards for control of mercury emissions we are positioned to provide this market and other highgrowth bromine and derivatives markets with sensible and sustainable solutions 

on a longer term basis we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap will continue to tighten as demand for existing and new uses of bromine expand we have commenced an expansion of our bromine and derivatives production capacity excluding flame retardants at our jbc joint venture in safi jordan with commercial completion and startup of the first two phases of this expansion expected in the first half of 2013 

our fine chemistry services businesses have delivered strong net sales and profitability during 2012 and opportunities are expanding in the renewables life sciences and electronic materials markets our pharmaceutical and crop protection businesses continue to deliver solid results we expect product development opportunities to continue such as partnering with exxonmobil corporation to make a specialty lubricant and with pharmaceutical developers like siga technologies in their manufacture of the st246 smallpox drug 

our technical expertise manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop a preferred outsourcing position serving leading chemical renewable and life science innovators in diverse industries we believe we will continue to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies our global effective tax rate was 220 for 2012 and we expect our global effective tax rate for 2013 to be approximately 255 however our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the us and other tax jurisdictions 

as outlined in our summary of accounting policies we reflect actuarial adjustments to our pension obligation in corporate and other as a component of nonoperating pension plan costs under marktomarket accounting results for the year ended december 31 2012 include an actuarial loss of approximately 76 million as compared to a loss of approximately 92 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

in the first quarter of 2012 we increased our quarterly dividend payout to 020 per share we repurchased approximately 11 million shares of our common stock during 2012 for approximately 64 million under our existing share repurchase program and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis in the first quarter of 2013 we increased our quarterly dividend payout to 024 per share 

we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint additional information regarding our products markets and financial performance is provided at our web sitewwwalbemarlecom our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference

comparison of 2012 to 2011 

net sales 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded net sales of 275 billion a 4 decrease compared to net sales of 287 billion for the corresponding period of 2011 this decrease was due primarily to unfavorable pricing impacts of 3 mainly lower metals surcharges in refinery catalysts and unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 1 mainly the weaker euro volume impacts on our net sales were flat yearoveryear with softness in our brominated flame retardants business and the unfavorable impacts from our phosphorus flame retardant business exit announced in the second quarter of 2012 being fully offset by strong yearoveryear volume impacts in our catalysts and fine chemistry segments 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2012 our gross profit decreased 450 million or 5 from the corresponding 2011 period due mainly to overall unfavorable pricing impacts from volatility in both metals surcharges and related cost impacts in refinery catalysts particularly rare earths unfavorable foreign currency impacts and unfavorable manufacturing spending partly offset by favorable overall volume impacts additionally our gross profit for 2012 was impacted by approximately 263 million of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses allocated to cost of goods sold as compared to 317 million in 2011 overall these factors contributed to our gross profit margin for the current year of 331  essentially flat with the corresponding period in 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2012 our selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased 468 million or 13 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 this decrease was primarily due to lower personnelrelated costs particularly incentive compensation and other spending as well as favorable impacts from foreign currency our sga for 2012 was impacted by approximately 511 million of pension and opeb costs including marktomarket actuarial losses as compared to 655 million in 2011 additionally sga for the current year included a a gain of 81 million resulting from proceeds received in connection with the settlement of litigation net of legal fees and b an 8 million charitable contribution to the albemarle foundation a nonprofit organization that sponsors grants health and social projects educational initiatives disaster relief matching gift programs scholarships and other charitable initiatives in locations where our employees live and operate 

as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 114 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 126 for the corresponding period in 2011 

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2012 our rd expenses increased 18 million or 2 from the year ended december 31 2011 due mainly to higher spending partly offset by favorable impacts from foreign currency as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 29 for the 2012 period compared to 27 in 2011 

restructuring and other charges net 

restructuring and other charges net were 1117 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and include the following items 

 

  

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 48 million to 328 million from the corresponding 2011 period due mainly to increases in interest capitalized on higher average construction work in progress balances and lower variablerate borrowings yearoveryear 

other income net 

other income net for the year ended december 31 2012 was 12 million versus 04 million for the corresponding 2011 period this change was due primarily to favorable interest income and other miscellaneous items partly offset by unfavorable currency over the corresponding period in 2011 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate for 2012 was 220 compared to 217 for 2011 our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods mainly due to the impact of earnings from outside the us also our effective income tax rate for the 2012 period was impacted by discrete net tax benefit items of 10 million related principally to tax planning and the release of various tax reserves for uncertain domestic tax positions due to the expiration of the domestic statute of limitations related to the 2008 tax year as well as 1008 million of pretax charges 761 million after taxes associated with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 381 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 438 million in the same period last year this decrease was due primarily to lower equity income amounts reported from our catalysts segment joint ventures fcc sa and nippon ketjen company limited as well as our polymer solutions joint venture magnifin 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2012 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 186 million compared to 281 million in the same period last year this decrease of 95 million was due primarily to lower yearoveryear profitability from our consolidated joint venture jbc based mainly on lower demand in our brominated flame retardants business 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation decreased to 3115 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 3921 million for the corresponding period of 2011 primarily due to restructuring and other charges in 2012 lower pricing including impacts from both volatility in metals surcharges and related cost impacts in refinery catalysts particularly rare earths unfavorable foreign currency impacts lower equity in net income of unconsolidated investments and higher rd costs these impacts were partly offset by favorable overall volume impacts including favorable impacts from our exit of the phosphorus business lower sga expenses lower interest and financing expenses higher other income net lower income tax expense and lower net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

segment information overview we have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the company’s key decision maker our chief executive officer in accordance with current accounting guidance our polymer solutions segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas our catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and pcs product areas our fine chemistry segment is comprised of the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas segment income represents operating profit adjusted for significant nonrecurring items and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments and is reduced by net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

in connection with our change in method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses relating to our global pension and opeb plans in 2012 service costs which represent the benefits earned by active employees during the period and amortization of prior service costsbenefits continue to be allocated to each segment the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense are included in corporate and other management believes this allocation will better reflect the operating results of each of its reporting segments prior year segment results have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in accounting principle and change in allocation of pension and opeb costs

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to the company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2012 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 51 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

during 2012 we elected to change our method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses relating to our global pension and opeb plans previously we recognized actuarial gains and losses from our pension and opeb plans in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders’ equity with amortization of these gains and losses that exceed 10 percent of the greater of plan assets or projected benefit obligations recognized each quarter in our consolidated statements of income over the average future service period of active employees under the new method of accounting referred to as marktomarket accounting these gains and losses will be recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year the remaining components of pension and opeb plan expense primarily service cost interest cost and expected return on assets will be recorded on a quarterly basis the gainloss subject to amortization and expected return on assets components of our pension expense has historically been calculated using a fiveyear smoothing of asset gains and losses referred to as the marketrelated value under marktomarket accounting the marketrelated value of assets will equal the actual market value as of the date of measurement while our historical policy of recognizing pension and opeb plan expense is considered acceptable under us gaap we believe that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results this change will also improve transparency within our operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred this change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively adjusting all prior periods presented 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or opeb plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2012 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on assets mortality and salary scales we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we establish a range of reasonable rates based on methods developed by subject matter experts that reflect current market conditions for 2012 we relied on methods developed by citigroup and milliman to establish a range of acceptable discount rates based on authoritative accounting guidance these methods calculate discount rates based on highquality bond data and the projected plan cash flows we believe our selected discount rates accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2012 measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we relied on aonhewitt methods including the aonhewitt topquartile and a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aagraded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 

at december 31 2012 the weightedaverage discount rate was reduced for the pension plans from 504 to 404 and for the opeb plans from 510 to 400 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2012 measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocations of plan assets to these investments for the years 2012 and 2011 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 825 the assumed rate of return on us pension plan assets has been changed to 725 effective january 1 2013 also there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 70 return on opeb plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 and benefit accruals will be frozen effective december 31 2014 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 and has been expanded to include all nonrepresented employees effective january 1 2013 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2012 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 337 from 396 for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 350 from 40 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2012 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends in relation to the employerpaid premium cap at december 31 2012 the assumed rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was zero as the employerpaid premium caps pre65 and post65 are met starting january 1 2013 

a 1 increase or decrease in the us health care cost trend rate would not have a material effect on the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued opeb liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and opeb cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands

of the 5699 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2012 708 million or approximately 12 are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 17 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 51 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax audits by tax authorities for years prior to 2009 since the us internal revenue service irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 and the statute of limitations expired for 2008 we also are no longer subject to any us state income tax audits prior to 2004 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2005 during 2012 the german tax authorities continued an audit of two of our german companies for 2006 through 2009 and the chinese tax authorities continued an audit of one of our chinese subsidiaries for 2006 through 2010 during 2011 we completed tax audits for one of our belgian companies for 2008 and 2009 our japanese company for 2006 through 2010 and two of our chinese companies through 2010 during 2010 we completed a tax audit for one of our belgian companies for the 2007 tax year no significant tax was assessed as a result of the completed audits 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 09 million as a result of closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses

internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting status and updates are provided to executive management and our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business and functional groups we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments funding working capital and repayment of debt we also make contributions to our us defined benefit pension plans as appropriate and pay dividends as well as repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continually focused on improving working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and other investing activities make pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 4777 million at december 31 2012 as compared to our ending balance at december 31 2011 of 4694 million our cash flows from operations provided 4888 million 4874 million and 3313 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our cash flows from operations in 2012 were essentially flat versus 2011 with favorable impacts from lower pension contributions being offset mainly by unfavorable impacts from lower profitability the increase in cash flows from operations in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to an increase in the operating profitability of our businesses favorable impacts from changes in working capital mainly accounts receivable in connection with our ongoing working capital management initiatives and lower pension contributions offset in part by lower deferred income taxes 

net charges amounting to 1008 million 761 million after income taxes in connection with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardants business were recorded in 2012 the charges are comprised mainly of noncash items consisting of net asset writeoffs of approximately 57 million and writeoffs of foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately 12 million as well as accruals for cash costs associated with related severance programs of approximately 22 million estimated site remediation costs of approximately 9 million and other estimated exit costs of approximately 3 million partly offset by a gain of approximately 2 million related to the sale of our nanjing china manufacturing site we began to realize favorable profit impacts from this program in the fourth quarter of 2012 and we expect to fund the majority of the obligations associated with this special charge expected to range from 5 million to 15 million in cash outflows after taxes with cash generated from our ongoing operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 net charges of 56 million comprised of onetime employer contribution to the company’s defined contribution plan in the amount of 101 million with 45 million in offsetting net gains from plan curtailments and related costs were recorded in connection with various amendments to certain of our us pension and defined contribution plans 

combined with cash on hand our cash from operations for 2012 funded major investing and financing activities including capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 2809 million 225 million in loans to our 50 owned joint venture socc repayments of longterm debt of 638 million repurchases of shares of our common stock of 636 million dividends to shareholders of 691 million and 91 million in withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation amounts distributed during the period in 2011 our operating cash flows funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1906 million repurchases of

common stock of 1781 million dividends to shareholders of 578 million and 1096 million in longterm debt repayments during the year in september 2011 we amended and restated our previous 6750 million credit facility see “longterm debt” below our cash flows from operations in 2010 were used mainly for funding capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 755 million dividends to shareholders of 496 million repurchases of common stock of 149 million and normal debt repayments during the year additionally our cash balances in 2010 were unfavorably impacted 126 million as a result of the january 1 2010 deconsolidation of our stannica llc joint venture further we raised approximately 473 million in borrowings in 2010 including 3469 million in net proceeds from our 45 senior notes offering in december 2010 

net current assets increased to approximately 10 billion at december 31 2012 from 9544 million at december 31 2011 the increase in net current assets was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable other assets cash and cash equivalents decreases in accounts payable and income taxes payable partly offset by a decrease in inventories and increases in accrued expenses and dividends payable 

capital expenditures were 2809 million 1906 million and 755 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 150 million in 2013 for capacity increases cost reduction and continuity of operations projects 

we made contributions to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans of 216 million 598 million and 801 million during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively included in contributions for the year ended december 31 2012 is a contribution of 141 million to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we and our joint venture partner each advanced 225 million to our 50owned joint venture socc pursuant to a longterm loan arrangement the proceeds under this arrangement are for the construction of socc’s aluminum alkyls manufacturing facility our loan bears quarterly interest at the libor plus 1275 per annum 158 as of december 31 2012 with interest receivable on a semiannual basis on january 1 and july 1 principal repayments on amounts outstanding under this arrangement are required as mutually agreed upon by the joint venture partners but with any outstanding balances receivable in full no later than december 31 2021 also during the year ended december 31 2012 we and our joint venture partner each advanced approximately 19 million euros approximately 25 million at december 31 2012 to our 50owned joint venture eurecat sa pursuant to a longterm loan arrangement 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of weakness in the global economy we are optimistic that as we enter into 2013 we will have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our september 2011 credit agreement the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

on february 12 2013 we increased our quarterly dividend payout to 024 per share a 20 increase from the quarterly rate of 020 per share paid in 2012 additionally on february 12 2013 our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the company is permitted to repurchase under its existing share repurchase program to 15 million from 39 million shares that remained outstanding under the program as of december 31 2012 we currently expect to repurchase approximately 10 of our outstanding shares over the next 10 to 15 months share repurchases will be funded through a combination of available cash on hand cash from operations and possibly debt 

at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 our cash and cash equivalents were comprised of approximately 3193 million and 4204 million respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are permanently reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be permanently reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we repatriated approximately 706 million 985 million and 145 million in cash respectively as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities 

longterm debt 

we currently have outstanding 3250 million of 510 senior notes due in 2015 and 3500 million of 450 senior notes due in 2020 or the senior notes the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the treasury rate as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2015 and 25 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2020 plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption however the 2020 senior notes are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time on or after three months prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption holders of the 2020 senior notes may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the related indenture 

the principal amounts of the senior notes become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries we believe that as of december 31 2012 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the covenants of the indentures governing the senior notes 

in september 2011 we amended and restated our previous 6750 million credit facility the amended and restated fiveyear revolving unsecured credit facility matures on september 22 2016 and i increased the borrowing capacity to 7500 million from 6750 million ii provides for an additional 2500 million in credit if needed subject to the terms of the agreement iii provides for the ability to extend the maturity date under certain conditions iv eliminated the covenant that required a minimum level of consolidated tangible domestic assets and v increased the interest rate spread and commitment fees applicable to the company’s borrowings under the credit facility fees and expenses of 27 million were incurred and paid in connection with this new agreement borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0900 to 1400 depending on the company’s credit rating applicable from time to time the applicable margin on the facility was 0975 as of december 31 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under the september 2011 credit agreement as of december 31 2012 

borrowings under the september 2011 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants i consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items or herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter ii with the exception of liens specified in our new credit facility liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the september 2011 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and iii with the exception of indebtedness specified in the september 2011 credit agreement subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement we believe that as of december 31 2012 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we previously maintained a 6750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving senior credit facility which we referred to as the march 2007 credit agreement the total spread and fees ranged from 032 to 0675 over the libor applicable to the currency of the borrowing and were based on our credit rating as determined by the major rating agencies 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 6866 million at december 31 2012 compared to 7493 million at december 31 2011 in addition at december 31 2012 we had the ability to borrow 7500 million under our september 2011 credit agreement and 2366 million under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our september 2011 credit agreement we have the ability to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the september 2011 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under those credit lines if any are classified as longterm debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 487 million at december 31 2012 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our projected contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment various take or pay and throughput agreements and obligations under our existing credit agreements based on projected borrowings in thousands 

 

  

  amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions we believe that the expected 2013 contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our serp should approximate 4 million we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we have made contributions of 42 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans both qualified and nonqualified and 141 million to our serp in connection with the retirement of our former ceo and executive chairman during the year ended december 31 2012 

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 292 million and 307 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 258 million and 218 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and longterm borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases make pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing while the corporate bond market remains strong availability of bank debt is more limited than in prior years due to a variety of factors including tighter bank regulations and more stringent bank capital requirements in the wake of the financial crisis and continued unease regarding fallout from the european sovereign debt concerns particularly relating to greece and spain if bank debt remains relatively less prevalent we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature it is also possible that our ability to access the capital markets in future periods may be limited by market or counterparty factors at a time when we would need or desire to do so which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions in addition our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability if the us federal reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response for example to improving economic conditions we may incur increased borrowing costs as our interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations 

at december 31 2012 we had the ability to borrow in excess of 986 million under our september 2011 credit agreement and other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our september 2011 credit agreement with generally strong cashgenerative businesses and no significant debt maturities before 2015 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 4777 million as of december 31 2012 which represent an important source of our liquidity our cash is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 390 million 354 million and 348 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2012 totaled approximately 203 million an increase of 79 million from 124 million at december 31 2011 during the second quarter of 2012 the company recorded 87 million in estimated site remediation liabilities at our avonmouth united kingdom site as part of the charges associated with our exit of the phosphorus flame retardant business 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 “legal proceedings” on page 22 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 254 million 161 million and 78 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional authoritative guidance relating to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the new guidance requires 1 disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs 2 a description of the valuation processes used by the entity and 3 a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs if any entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are not recorded at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which fair value is disclosed the new requirements clarify that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only apply to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets the new requirements also specify that in the absence of a level 1 input a reporting entity should incorporate a premium or a discount in a fair value measurement if a market participant would take into account such an input in pricing an asset or liability additionally the new guidance introduces an option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting positions on a net basis if certain criteria are met these amendments became effective for us on january 1 2012 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in june 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance which eliminated the option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity however under the guidance comprehensive income and its components must still be presented under one of two new alternatives under the first alternative the components of other comprehensive income and the components of net income may be presented in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income under the second alternative a statement of other comprehensive income would immediately follow the statement of net income and must be shown with equal prominence as the other primary financial statements under either alternative an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income the company adopted these new financial statement presentation requirements effective january 1 2012 with retrospective application to all prior periods presented 

in september 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment the new guidance gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test under existing accounting guidance is required to be performed otherwise no further testing is required these new provisions became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance that will require entities to disclose information about financial instruments including derivatives and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement in january 2013 the fasb issued additional guidance that limits the scope of these new requirements to certain derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions these new provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires companies to present either in a single note or on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety companies would instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information these new provisions are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 2740 million and with a fair value representing a net liability position of 05 million at december 31 2012 fluctuations in the value of these contracts are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we

conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2012 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately 170 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an increase of approximately 112 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2012 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had variable interest rate borrowings of 70 million and 643 million outstanding at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively these borrowings represented 1 and 8 of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 174 and 515 at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively a hypothetical 10 increase approximately 17 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by less than 01 million as of december 31 2012 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market from time to time we enter into natural gas hedge contracts with one or more major financial institutions for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and are not entered into for trading purposes at december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemistry products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs specialty materials and chemicals from renewables 

our most significant pharmaceutical bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

we will continue to sell methyl bromide in our current markets throughout 2012 as current regulations allow with smaller criticaluse allowances compared to 2011 in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the us western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for “critical uses” where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by the us environmental protection agency or epa the us submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

customers 

our fine chemistry segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling and oil services water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies 

pricing for many of our fine chemistry products and services is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

competition 

our fine chemistry segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the fine chemistry marketplace 

we are a market leader in the brominebased products groups and primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers chemtura corporation and israel chemicals we are a leading producer of pharmaceutical bulk actives ie ibuprofen and propofol and we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation lonza clariant ltd and cilag ag however there is increasing competition from asian sources we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new high quality innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer solutions is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles such as our newly commercialized earthwise tm brand which provides polymer solutions products including our greenarmor tm product that are greatly enhanced in both end product performance and environmental responsibility plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and valueadded plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

catalysts research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers our performance catalysts customers and the developing markets for advanced biofuels refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the performance catalysts area we are focused primarily on developing metal organics for led applications catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems for polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers for biofuel production we work closely with customers to develop sustainable and efficient liquid fuels from renewable resources including the supply of catalysts for the production of highperformance biodiesel 

the primary focus of our fine chemistry research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants 

we have recognized research and development expenses of 771 million 584 million and 609 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2011 we owned approximately 1600 active us and foreign patents and approximately 1400 pending us and foreign patent applications we also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2011 with an occupational injury and illness rate of 029 for albemarle employees and nested contractors down from 054 in 2010 

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new requirements under the european commission’s proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern  such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic or cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic or pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative or vpvb and endocrine disruptors  will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2009 one of our products was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern under authorization hexabromocyclododecane or hbcd our sales of hbcd approximated 21 12 and 14 of our total annual net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation for example in 2009 the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july 1 2010 and in televisions and computers after july 1 2012 the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january 1 2011 in 2010 the state of maine broadened existing restrictions on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether to include its use in plastic pallets effective january 1 2012 also the european union’s existing restrictions on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment have been copied by the republic of india and are likely to be adopted in the people’s republic of china as well in december 2009 we along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal in cooperation with the epa from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years which should be completed by 2014 a similar agreement was reached later with canada bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several us states 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party or prp with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

under cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed below our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 47 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities the company seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as biofuels gastoliquids and others emission control technologies including mercury emissions and other similar solutions as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to invest in and expand our product offerings of alternative fuel technologies as a result of the investments in alternative fuel technology products and services to date and our continued focus on these growth areas we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted see also page 15 for further discussion on climate change in item 1a risk factors 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example our fine chemistry segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian producers in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more costeffective catalysts products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches 

attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated these attempts which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business to the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information we may incur liability as a result 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we and our joint ventures currently have over 30 facilities located outside the us including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany hungary india italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture a delay or cancellation of those capital projects and negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we may become subject potentially some form of us federal regulation is forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co 2  andor “cap and trade” legislation additionally some of our operations are within other jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions for example we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol is set to expire in 2012 and global attention is focused on the development of a successor global policy framework the outcome of new legislation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional regulation additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs or additional taxes or reduced emission allowances we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations through our contractual terms which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether which was banned for some applications in the states of washington maine oregon and vermont in 2009 the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july 1 2010 and in televisions and computers after july 1 2012 the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january 1 2011 in december 2009 we along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal in cooperation with the epa from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years a similar agreement was reached later with canada bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several us states 

norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april 2008 except for certain transportation applications on april 1 2008 the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption as a consequence the use of decabromodiphenyl 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july 1 2008 in 2010 the republic of india decided to adopt similar legislation effective january 1 2012 in 2011 less than 1 of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 

additionally agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants including decabromodiphenyl ether hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants the persistent organic pollutants review committee a scientific body to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops recommended in october 2011 that hexabromocyclododecane be listed under the convention the united nations’ unep agency continues its evaluation of hexabromocyclododecane no action restricting the use of hexabromocyclododecane is expected before mid2013 in february 2011 the european union included hexabromocyclododecane on a list of substances published under annex xiv of the reach regulation our expectation is that the sale of hexabromocyclododecane could be banned in europe under the reach process as soon as 2014 in 2011 approximately 21 of our net sales were derived from hexabromocyclododecane 

additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

natural disasters and weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters or other natural disasters occur in the future they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels if at all and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2011 we had 4260 employees approximately 17 of our 2155 us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2013 2014 and 2015 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include

 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us the netherlands germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 94 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2011 we made 500 million of voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans and in 2010 we made 700 million of voluntary contributions to these plans we anticipate that the funded status of each of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans will be at least 80 in 2012 and therefore the plans should not be subject to benefit limitations in conjunction with the pension protection act of 2006 additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2012 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns thencurrent interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as an american chemistry council member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on a weighted average interest rate of 48 and outstanding borrowings at december 31 2011 of 7637 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 367 million a hypothetical 10 change approximately 52 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to the variable portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 03 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our september 2011 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our september 2011 credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 45 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our september 2011 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa1 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our september 2011 credit agreement 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

the instruments governing our indebtedness do not limit our acquisitions and may allow us to incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness in relation to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement and expand our distribution network the terms of our indebtedness do not limit the number or scale of acquisitions that we may complete because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 3 2006 we received a notice of violation the 2006 nov from the us environmental protection agency region 4 or epa regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg south carolina the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant in the second quarter of 2011 the company was served with a complaint by the epa in the united states district court for the district of south carolina based on the alleged violations set out in the 2006 nov seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief the complaint was subsequently amended to add the state of south carolina as a plaintiff we intend to vigorously defend this action any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines penalties capital expenditures or some combination thereof at this time it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of this litigation or the financial impact which may result therefrom however we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation where appropriate we may establish financial reserves as estimated by our general counsel for such proceedings we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

2011 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 outlook 

for most of 2011 we saw strong performance in the global markets that we serve with our businesses being well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities as well as opportunities to invest in those markets that continue to bring new demand during the third quarter of 2011 we began to see expected signs of volume softness affecting mainly our polymer solutions segment which we attribute to end market response to global economic weakness we are closely monitoring customer order patterns and other performance trends in our businesses overall and the markets which they serve in light of these current uncertainties as well as working to manage potential headwinds such as increased raw material and energy costs pension and other personnel costs overall our business fundamentals remain strong and we believe that if the end markets we serve begin to stabilize and accelerate over the course of 2012 we should continue to make progress towards our longterm growth objectives 

polymer solutions our pricing programs combined with favorable impacts from foreign currency resulted in strong yearoveryear financial performance for 2011 especially in our fire safety business improved pricing helped offset raw material inflation as well as fund further investment in new products and technologies however during the third quarter of 2011 and through the end of the year we began to see signs of softening demand in our fire safety business largely in mineral flame retardants which we believe was attributable to endmarket order patterns in response to the current weakness in the global economy we are closely monitoring customer order patterns in this business for indications of sustained slow growth however we believe our business fundamentals in this sector remain strong and combined with our competitive position product innovations pricing initiatives to offset raw material inflation and overall operating discipline we believe the company continues to be well positioned to manage through any potentially slower growth trends in the markets served by this business 

on a longterm basis we continue to believe improving global standards of living coupled with the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations and global climate initiatives should drive continued demand for fire safety products further we continue to focus on globalization in this segment with our antioxidants facility in shanghai positioning us well for growth in china 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

greenarmor tm  the first earthwise tm product from our polymer solutions segment has reached the commercialization stage and we are currently negotiating potential supply contracts with key customers for this product the earthwise tm portfolio comprised of products that serve the polymers industry and which are greatly enhanced in both end market performance and environmental responsibility is expected to grow to include products from other business units and segments of albemarle 

catalysts favorable impacts from overall improved volumes higher pricing to counter significant raw material price increases and stronger yearoveryear results from our equity joint ventures drove net sales and earnings growth in our catalysts segment during 2011 increased global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements are expected to drive growth in our refinery catalysts business we expect growth in our performance catalysts solutions division to come from growing global demand for plastics particularly in asia and the middle east our fluidized catalytic cracking or fcc refinery catalysts business has seen significant price increases in rare earth materials due to recent chinese export quotas our steps to maintain sufficient security of supply for the foreseeable future as well as cost passthrough mechanisms that have been implemented are helping us sustain current profitability levels for this business in the current year 

new market penetrations and introduction of innovative costeffective products for the refining and polyolefins industries contributed to the segment’s performance in 2011 we believe our focus on advanced product development in catalysts is achieving commercial success and we have introduced new valueadded refining solutions and technologies that enable refiners to increase yields a critical advantage for refiners our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned enabling us to continue to bring innovative technologies to the market additionally we expect to continue exploring new alternative fuel opportunities by partnering with leading renewable fuels technology developers who can benefit from albemarle’s catalysis expertise we recently expanded our presence in the biofuels market with the acquisition of catilin inc announced on may 11 2011 catilin is a technology leader in the development and application of heterogeneous biodiesel catalysis whose technology and products will further strengthen our offerings for the renewable fuels market 

we expect to leverage our existing positions in the middle east asia and brazil along with our joint ventures to capitalize on growth opportunities and further develop our leading position in those emerging markets our joint venture in saudi arabia with sabic expected to be operational in 2012 positions us to lead in the fastgrowing middle east polyolefins market construction at our recently acquired yeosu south korea site is progressing well where existing assets have allowed us to rapidly develop research and smallscale production facilities adding immediate value to the metallocene polyolefin and high brightness led regional markets intermediate commercial operations at the site began in 2011 with the commercial facility expected to be fully operational in 2012 to meet regional growth in metallocene polyolefins and trimethyl gallium tmg markets for high brightness led additionally we are working on project scope and design elements for a future brazilian hydroprocessing catalysts investment with petrobras 

fine chemistry our fine chemistry segment continues to benefit from the rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions we believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on the two strategic areas in our fine chemistry segment – maximizing our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and continued growth of our fine chemistry services business 

in our performance chemicals sector we saw strong growth over the course of 2011 as demand across our bromine franchise expanded with new applications widening the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives and global supply remaining tight our completion fluids business regained traction in 2011 and we believe this trend should continue into 2012 as global drilling activity continues to operate at significantly higher levels than in the prior year further we have commenced an expansion of our bromine production capacity at our jbc joint venture in safi jordan additionally we are encouraged by longterm drivers in the us and china for our mercury control business we are positioned to provide these markets with sensible sustainable solutions to meet new regulatory demands including emission prevention and control directives for coalfueled power plants in the us and china and waste reduction initiatives in the cement production industry in connection with the new cementmact mercury emission standard in response to the emerging opportunities in this market during the third quarter of 2011 we formed our new environmental division this division will function within our fine chemistry segment and will provide environmental control solutions to the coalfired utility cement kiln and industrial boiler markets through the development of multipollutant control technologies 

we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap will continue to tighten as demand for existing and new uses of bromine expand and global supply remains tight we are positioned to expand capacity as needed at our lowcost production facilities 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our fine chemistry services product pipeline is strong and opportunities are expanding our pharmaceutical and crop protection businesses continue to deliver solid results we expect product development opportunities to continue such as partnering with exxonmobil corporation to make a specialty lubricant and with pharmaceutical developers like siga technologies in their manufacture of the st246 smallpox drug also in the third quarter of 2011 we announced our agreement to provide customer scaleup and production services for synthetic renewable base oils for the lubricants market to novvi sa a joint venture between amyris inc and cosan sa indústria e comércio focused on the development production marketing and distribution of highperformance renewable base oils 

our technical expertise manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries we believe we will continue to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiencies our global effective tax rate for 2011 was 236 and we expect our rate for 2012 will be approximately 25 however our tax rate continues to be subject to potential variability based on the jurisdictions in which income is actually earned and changes in tax rates and laws further in 2012 we expect our noncash us pension and postretirement expense could increase up to 20 million over 2011 expense amounts 

the strong performance of our businesses in 2011 enabled us to announce two dividend increases in the first quarter of 2011 we increased our quarterly dividend payout to 165 cents per share followed by another increase to 175 cents per share on october 13 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 15 2011 

we repurchased three million shares of our common stock in the third quarter of 2011 for approximately 178 million under our existing share repurchase program and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis 

on september 22 2011 we amended and restated our previous 6750 million credit facility under the terms of the amended and restated fiveyear revolving unsecured credit facility we have the ability to borrow 7500 million with an option for another 2500 million subject to the terms of the agreement which we believe will give us continuing liquidity for both our shortterm and longterm operating needs 

we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint additional information regarding our products markets and financial performance is provided at our web site wwwalbemarlecom  our web site is not a part of this document nor is it incorporated herein by reference

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our gross profit increased 2311 million or 31 from the corresponding 2010 period due mainly to favorable pricing across our segments as well as overall favorable net impacts from foreign currency partly offset mainly by higher variable input costs primarily raw materials and manufacturing spending overall these factors contributed to our improved gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2011 of 341 up from 316 for the corresponding period in 2010 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 464 million or 17 from the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs including performance based compensation and pension costs higher sales commissions and unfavorable foreign currency impacts due mainly to the stronger euro as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 109 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 112 for the corresponding period in 2010 

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our research and development rd expenses increased 187 million or 32 from the year ended december 31 2010 mainly due to higher department spending associated with our ongoing investment in organic growth opportunities as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts due mainly to the stronger euro as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 27 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 25 for the corresponding period in 2010 

restructuring and other charges 

the year ended december 31 2010 included charges amounting to 70 million 46 million after income taxes for restructuring costs related to reductions in force at our bergheim germany site the program associated with these charges have and are expected to continue to yield favorable impacts in our reported operating costs in future reporting periods we have and will continue to fund the majority of the obligations associated with these type programs with cash flow generated from operating activities 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 376 million as compared to 255 million for the corresponding 2010 period this increase was due mainly to higher average interest rates on our outstanding borrowings 

other income net 

other income net for the year ended december 31 2011 was 04 million versus 28 million for the corresponding 2010 period this change was due primarily to comparatively unfavorable results on our foreign exchange gains and losses yearoveryear partly offset by higher interest income versus the corresponding period in 2010 based on higher average cash balances yearoveryear 

income tax expense 

the effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 236 the company’s effective income tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors our level and location of income the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was mainly due to the impact of earnings from outside the us 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 438 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 380 million in 2010 this increase was due primarily to improved results in our catalysts segment joint ventures fcc sa and nippon ketjen 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 281 million compared to 136 million in 2010 this increase was due primarily to improved volumes and profitability from our consolidated joint venture jordan bromine company limited or jbc based on higher demand for the products in our bromine and derivatives portfolio 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

net income attributable to albemarle corporation 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation was 4363 million for the year ended december 31 2011 up from 3237 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to overall favorable sales pricing impacts favorable net impacts from foreign currency lower restructuring and other charges and favorable equity in net income of unconsolidated investments these favorable impacts were partly offset primarily by higher variable input costs higher manufacturing spending higher sga and rd costs higher interest and financing expenses higher income taxes and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

 polymer solutions 

polymer solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 10 billion up 11 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 due mainly to the impact of favorable pricing of 16 resulting mainly from the execution of recent price increases during the year in our fire safety portfolio largely in response to rising raw material costs lower volume impacts of 8 for the segment were offset by favorable foreign currency impacts of 3 our stabilizers and curatives business also showed favorable pricing and foreign currency impacts in 2011 over 2010 although partly offset by lower volumes segment income for polymer solutions was 2378 million for the year ended december 31 2011 up 20 versus the same period in 2010 due mainly to the overall pricing improvements noted above and favorable impacts from foreign currency partly offset by higher variable input costs mainly raw materials lower volumes and higher manufacturing and sgard spending further polymer solutions segment results for 2011 were unfavorably impacted 36 million in higher charges from net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our jbc joint venture while equity in net income from our unconsolidated investment magnifin was 77 million for the year ended december 31 2011 down 10 million from the year ended december 31 2010 due to lower yearoveryear sales volumes for that joint venture 

catalysts

net sales 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we reported net sales of 236 billion which was an 18 increase compared to net sales of 201 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was due primarily to an increase in volumes in all segments which benefited from the global economic recovery as well as favorable pricemix partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts mainly the weaker euro volumes and pricemix had a positive impact on sales of 17 and 2 respectively partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 

polymer solutions net sales increased 2065 million or 30 for the year ended december 31 2010 versus the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly due to the impact of higher volumes of 25 and favorable pricingmix of 6 offset in part by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1 catalysts net sales for the year 2010 increased 819 million or 10 compared to 2009 due mainly to higher volumes fine chemistry net sales increased 689 million or 14 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to last year mainly due to the impact of higher volumes of 17 partly offset by unfavorable pricemix impacts of 2 and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 for a detailed discussion of revenues and segment income for each segment see “segment information overview” below 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our gross profit increased 2621 million or 54 from the corresponding 2009 period due mainly to sales volume improvements favorable production rate impacts on cost in our bromine franchise and improved realization of metals costs in hpc refinery catalysts we operated our manufacturing facilities at higher rates in 2010 than prior year to meet current sales demands contributing to favorable profit effects from higher fixed cost absorption with only minor offsetting increases in manufacturing spending due to the increased production levels these key factors contributed to overall improvement in our gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2010 to 316 up from 241 for the year 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our sga expenses increased 531 million or 25 from the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher employee related expenses during 2010 versus the corresponding period in 2009

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 380 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 223 million in 2009 this increase of 157 million was due primarily to higher overall equity earnings from our various catalysts segment joint ventures particularly in our nippon ketjen joint venture due mainly to favorable material input costs in the current year our fcc sa joint venture due to lower variable input costs compared to the prior year and the inclusion of the equity results of our stannica llc joint venture which we deconsolidated on january 1 2010 we also had higher equity earnings from our magnifin joint venture in our polymer solutions segment due to increased demand in the automotive sector 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 136 million compared to 113 million in 2009 this increase was due primarily to 56 million in higher noncontrolling interest earnings of jbc as a result of improvements in bromine franchise sales volumes offset in part by the impacts of the deconsolidation of our stannica llc joint venture which reported 37 million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2009 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation increased to 3237 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 1784 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to sales and production volume increases favorable fixed cost absorption across our businesses favorable metals cost realization in our hpc refinery catalysts business favorable equity in net income of our unconsolidated investments lower special items lower rd spending and favorable other income expense net these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher sga costs higher income taxes higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher interest and financing expenses

 polymer solutions 

polymer solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 9037 million up 2065 million or 30 in comparison to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly due to the impact of higher volumes of 25 net of 429 million in unfavorable net sales impact from the january 1 2010 stannica llc deconsolidation and favorable pricemix impacts of 6 offset in part by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 mainly the weaker euro the increase in volumes directly resulting from improved economic conditions over 2009 was primarily in our fire safety portfolio in the consumer electronics automotive and construction sectors while our stabilizers and curatives product lines also showed higher volumes in antioxidants and curatives segment income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 1983 million versus 614 million for 2009 the yearoveryear improvement in operating performance was due mainly to the sales volume and pricemix improvements noted above as well as higher production volumes which contributed to favorable fixed cost absorption also polymer solutions segment income for 2010 benefited from higher equity in net income of 52 million from its unconsolidated investment magnifin due to increased demand in the automotive sector compared to the prior year as well as the favorable impact of the january 1 2010 deconsolidation of stannica llc which reported 37 million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the polymer solutions segment results during the year ended december 31 2009 these favorable items were partially offset by 40 million in higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulting from improved performance in our jbc joint venture 

catalysts 

catalysts segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 8900 million an increase of 819 million or 10 versus the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was due mainly to higher volumes in refinery catalysts particularly fcc refinery catalysts due to higher refinery operating rates and alternative fuels as well as an increase in volumes in performance catalyst solutions arising from stronger customer demand over the challenged 2009 year catalysts segment income increased 67 or 1001 million to 2488 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly in our hpc business due mainly to improved realization of metals cost passthrough impacts yearoveryear as well as favorable sales

and production volumes in fcc refinery catalysts and alternative fuels and favorable volumes in performance catalyst solutions catalysts segment income for the year ended december 31 2010 also benefited 107 million from higher equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures particularly in nippon ketjen due mainly to favorable material input costs versus the prior year our fcc sa joint venture due to lower variable input costs and favorable equity results from our stannica llc joint venture investment which we deconsolidated on january 1 2010 and whose results were previously reported in the polymer solutions segment in prior years these favorable impacts on segment income for catalysts were offset in part by higher sgard spending of 105 million compared to the corresponding period in 2009 

fine chemistry 

fine chemistry segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 5690 million an increase of 689 million or 14 versus the year ended december 31 2009 with higher volumes mainly in performance chemicals resulting from overall improved customer demand contributing 17 of the increase these favorable volume impacts net of 72 million in unfavorable sales impacts from the july 30 2010 divestiture of our teesport uk site were partly offset by unfavorable pricemix impacts of 2 and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 mainly the weaker euro fine chemistry segment income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 721 million up 250 million or 53 from 2009 these improved results were due to higher sales and production volumes in the segment mainly in performance chemicals offset in part by higher sgard spending of 64 million and 19 million in higher net income in noncontrolling interests resulting mainly from improved performance in our jbc joint venture 

corporate and other 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our corporate and other expense was 730 million versus 358 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs also the year ended december 31 2009 included adjustments of 78 million associated with the reversal of certain longterm employee benefit accruals reflected mainly in sga expenses 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation incorporates industryweighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 51 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2011 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits pre65 premium cap and the related healthcare trend rates we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we establish a range of reasonable rates based on methods developed by subject matter experts that reflect current market conditions for 2011 we relied on methods developed by citigroup aonhewitt and milliman to establish a range of acceptable discount rates based on authoritative accounting guidance these methods calculate discount rates based on highquality bond data and the projected plan cash flows we believe our selected discount rates accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2011 measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we relied on aonhewitt methods including the aonhewitt topquartile and a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aagraded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

at december 31 2011 the weightedaverage discount rate was reduced for the pension plans from 540 to 504 and for the other postretirement plans from 530 to 510 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2011 measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments for the years 2011 and 2010 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 825 there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on us pension plan assets effective january 1 2012 also there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 70 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2011 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 396 from 393 for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase remained unchanged at 40 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2011 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends in relation to the employerpaid premium cap at december 31 2011 the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the pre65 and post65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was reduced to zero as the employerpaid premium cap is expected to meet the cap starting january 1 2013 for 2012 the assumed trend rate for pre65 coverage is 80 per year ultimately decreasing to zero in the year 2013 due to the employerpaid premium cap the 2012 assumed trend rate for post65 coverage is expected to be zero due to the employerpaid premium cap 

a 1 increase or decrease in the us health care cost trend rate would not have a material effect on the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 

 

  

 of the 5388 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2011 730 million or 136 are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 17 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 51 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2008 since the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 or for any us state income tax audit prior to 2002 with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006 during 2011 we completed tax audits for one of our belgian companies for 2008 and 2009 our japanese company for 2006 through 2010 and two of our chinese companies through 2010 during 2010 we completed a tax audit for one of our belgian companies for the 2007 tax year no significant tax was assessed as a result of these audits we were informed in 2011 that german tax authorities would commence an audit of one of our german companies for 2006 through 2009 and chinese tax authorities would commence an audit of one of our chinese companies for 2006 through 2010 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 59 million as a result of closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting status and updates are provided to executive management and our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business and functional groups we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets funding working capital and repayment of debt additionally we have made total contributions to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans of approximately 60 million 80 million and 40 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we also periodically repurchase shares of our common stock on an opportunistic basis including 1781 million in share repurchases during 2011 

we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our september 2011 credit agreement which is discussed below to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents were 4694 million at december 31 2011 as compared to our ending balance at december 31 2010 of 5297 million our cash flows from operations provided 4874 million 3313 million and 3585 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the increase in cash flows from operations in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our businesses favorable impacts from changes in working capital mainly accounts receivable in connection with our ongoing working capital management initiatives and lower pension contributions offset in part by lower deferred income taxes the decrease of 272 million in operating cash flows for 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to an increase in working capital mainly inventories and accounts receivable in connection with the global economic recovery and pension contributions offset in part by the strong increase in profitability of our businesses 

in 2011 our operating cash flows funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1906 million repurchases of common stock of 1781 million dividends to shareholders of 578 million and 1096 million in longterm debt repayments during the year in september 2011 we amended and restated our previous 6750 million credit facility see “longterm debt” below 

our cash flows from operations in 2010 were used mainly for funding capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 755 million dividends to shareholders of 496 million repurchases of common stock of 149 million and normal debt repayments during the year additionally our cash balances in 2010 were unfavorably impacted 126 million as a result of the january 1 2010 deconsolidation of our stannica llc joint venture further we raised approximately 473 million in borrowings in 2010 including 3469 million in net proceeds from our 45 senior notes offering in december 2010 

for the year 2009 our cash flows from operating activities funded capital expenditures of 1008 million for plant machinery and equipment 1200 million in net repayments of debt 444 million in dividends to shareholders and 164 million in obligations arising from the 2008 port de bouc facility divestiture 

net current assets decreased 296 million to 9544 million at december 31 2011 from 9840 million at december 31 2010 the decrease in net current assets was due primarily to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accrued expenses partly offset mainly by increases in inventories and accounts receivable 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

capital expenditures were 1906 million 755 million and 1008 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment we expect our capital expenditures to approach 300 million in 2012 for capacity increases cost reduction and continuity of operations projects 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of weakness in the global economy we are optimistic that as we enter into 2012 we will have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our september 2011 credit agreement the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 our cash and cash equivalents were comprised of approximately 4204 million and 3378 million respectively held by our foreign subsidiaries the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are permanently reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures acquisitions research operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations from time to time we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be permanently reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the internal revenue code for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we repatriated approximately 985 million 145 million and 56 million in cash respectively as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities 

longterm debt 

we currently have outstanding 3250 million of 510 senior notes due in 2015 and 3500 million of 450 senior notes due in 2020 or the senior notes the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2015 and 25 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2020 plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption however the 2020 senior notes are redeemable as a whole or in part at our option at any time on or after three months prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption holders of the 2020 senior notes may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the related indenture agreement 

the principal amounts of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries we believe that as of december 31 2011 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the covenants of the indentures governing the senior notes 

in september 2011 we amended and restated our previous 6750 million credit facility the amended and restated fiveyear revolving unsecured credit facility matures on september 22 2016 and i increased the borrowing capacity to 7500 million from 6750 million ii provides for an additional 2500 million in credit if needed subject to the terms of the agreement iii provides for the ability to extend the maturity date under certain conditions iv eliminated the covenant that required a minimum level of consolidated tangible domestic assets and v increased the interest rate spread and commitment fees applicable to the company’s borrowings under the credit facility fees and expenses of 27 million were incurred and paid in connection with this new agreement borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0900 to 1400 depending on the company’s credit rating applicable from time to time the applicable margin on the facility was 0975 as of december 31 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding under the september 2011 credit agreement as of december 31 2011 

borrowings under the september 2011 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants i consolidated funded debt as defined in the agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

the agreement which reflects adjustments for certain nonrecurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges facility divestiture charges and other significant nonrecurring items or herein “consolidated adjusted ebitda” as of the end of any fiscal quarter ii with the exception of liens specified in our new credit facility liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the new credit facility would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and iii with the exception of indebtedness specified in our new credit facility subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement we believe that as of december 31 2011 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

we previously maintained a 6750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving senior credit facility which we referred to as the march 2007 credit agreement the total spread and fees ranged from 032 to 0675 over the libor applicable to the currency of the borrowing and were based on our credit rating as determined by the major rating agencies there were no borrowings outstanding under the march 2007 credit agreement at december 31 2010 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 7493 million at december 31 2011 compared to 8519 million at december 31 2010 in addition at december 31 2011 we had the ability to borrow 7500 million under our september 2011 credit agreement and 2338 million under other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our september 2011 credit agreement we have the ability to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the september 2011 credit agreement as applicable therefore the amounts outstanding under our other existing credit lines are classified as longterm debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 359 million at december 31 2011 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our projected contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment various take or pay and throughput agreements and obligations under our existing credit agreements based on projected borrowings in thousands 

 

  

  amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions we believe that the expected 2012 contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans including our serp should approximate 17 million we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we have made 561 million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december 31 2011 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled 307 million and 219 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled 218 million and 123 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash provided by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our september 2011 credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures make pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit renew their extensions of credit or provide new financing while the corporate bond market remains strong availability of bank debt is more limited than in prior years due to a variety of factors including tighter bank regulations and more stringent bank capital requirements in the wake of the financial crisis and most recently increased concern regarding fallout from the european sovereign debt issues if bank debt remains relatively less prevalent we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature it is also possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by market or counterparty factors at a time when we would need or desire to do so which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions in addition our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

at december 31 2011 we had the ability to borrow in excess of 9838 million under our september 2011 credit agreement and other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our september 2011 credit agreement with generally strong cash generative businesses and no significant debt maturities before 2015 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 4694 million as of december 31 2011 which represent an important source of our liquidity our cash is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to our operations 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 354 million 348 million and 363 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2011 totaled approximately 124 million a decrease of 14 million from 138 million at december 31 2010 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 “legal proceedings” on page 22

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 161 million 78 million and 114 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued new accounting guidance relating to separating consideration in multipledeliverable revenue arrangements under this guidance multipledeliverable arrangements will be accounted for separately rather than on a combined basis by selecting the best evidence of selling price among vendorspecific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or estimated selling price this new guidance effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 new accounting guidance was issued by the fasb that requires additional disclosures about amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and the reasons therefor additionally entities are now required to present information about purchases sales issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable level 3 inputs the amendments also clarified that entities should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class or subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position and entities should disclose information about inputs and valuation techniques for level 2 and level 3 fair value measurements whether recurring or nonrecurring these amendments were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level 3 inputs which were effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years the provisions of this guidance did not have a have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 the fasb amended its accounting guidance related to the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations under the amended guidance a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period the amendments also require public entities to provide a description of the nature and amount of any material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to business combinations that are included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings these amendments became effective for us on january 1 2011 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance relating to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the new guidance requires 1 disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs 2 a description of the valuation processes used by the entity and 3 a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs if any entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are not recorded at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which fair value is disclosed the new requirements clarify that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only apply to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets the new requirements also specify that in the absence of a level 1 input a reporting entity should incorporate a premium or a discount in a fair value measurement if a market participant would take into account such an input in pricing an asset or liability additionally the new guidance introduces an option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting positions on a net basis if certain criteria are met for public entities these new requirements become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we are assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance which eliminates the current option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity however under the new guidance comprehensive income and its components must still be presented under one of two new alternatives under the first alternative the components of other comprehensive income and the components of net income may be presented in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income under the second alternative a statement of other comprehensive income would immediately follow the statement of net income and must be shown with equal prominence as the other primary financial statements under either alternative an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income the company will adopt these new financial statement presentation requirements effective january 1 2012 with retrospective application to all prior periods presented 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment the new guidance gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test under existing accounting guidance is required to be performed otherwise no further testing is required these new provisions are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued new accounting guidance that will require entities to disclose information about instruments including derivatives and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement these new provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented we are assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of 1487 million and with a fair value representing a net liability position of 09 million at december 31 2011 fluctuations in the value of these contracts are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2011 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately 47 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of approximately 27 million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2011 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of 643 million and 1495 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively these borrowings represented 8 and 17 of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 515 and 225 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively a hypothetical 10 change approximately 52 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 03 million as of december 31 2011 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market from time to time we enter into natural gas hedge contracts with one or more major financial institutions for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and are not entered into for trading purposes at december 31 2011 and 2010 we had no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding

for financial information regarding our operating segments including revenues generated for each of the last three fiscal years from each of the product categories included in our operating segments and geographic areas see note 23 “operating segments and geographic area information” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 47 

polymer solutions 

our polymer solutions segment consists of two product market categories flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives 

flame retardants our fire safety technology enables the use of plastics in high performance high heat applications by enhancing the flame resistant properties of these materials some of the end market products that benefit from our fire safety technology include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics printed circuit boards wire and cable electrical connectors textiles foam insulation and foam seating in furniture and automobiles we compete in all of the markets for the major fire safety chemistries brominated mineral and phosphorus our brominated flame retardants include products such as saytex ®  our mineralbased flame retardants include products such as martinal ® and magnifin ®  and our phosphorusbased flame retardants include products such as antiblaze ® and ncendx ®  our strategy is to have a broad range of chemistries applicable to each major flame retardant application 

stabilizers and curatives we produce plastic and other additives such as curatives antioxidants and stabilizers which are often specially developed and formulated for a customer’s specific manufacturing requirements our additives products include curatives for polyurethane polyurea and epoxy system polymerization this business also produces antioxidants and stabilizers to improve the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins we are wellpositioned for global growth notably with our leading antioxidant supplier position in the rapidly growing chinese market 

our ethacure ® curatives are used in cast elastomers coatings reaction injection molding rim and specialty adhesives that are incorporated into products such as wheels tires and rollers our line of ethanox ® antioxidants is used by manufacturers of polyolefins to maintain physical properties during the manufacturing process including the color of the final product these antioxidants are found in applications such as slit film wire and cable food packaging and pipes 

we also produce antioxidants used in fuels and lubricants our line of ethanox ® fuel and lubricant antioxidants is used by refiners and fuel marketers to extend fuel storage life and protect fuel systems and by oil marketers and lubricant manufacturers to extend the useful life of lubricating oils fluids and greases used in engines and various types of machinery

customers 

our polymer solutions segment offers more than 70 products to a variety of endmarkets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers lubricant manufacturers refiners and other specialty chemical companies 

sales of polymer solutions in asia are expected to grow longterm due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states or us and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the us europe china and the middle east we are now operating three production facilities in china to deliver polymer solutions products to this rapidly growing market 

a number of customers of our polymer solutions segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical 

competition 

our polymer solutions segment serves the following geographic markets the us asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the polymer solutions marketplace 

competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers and resin systems in endproducts in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries which is why our product portfolio includes bromine mineral and phosphorus chemistries that are common in over 80 of end uses today for other additives competition is introduced by lowcost antioxidant suppliers we offer our basic antioxidant products from lower cost manufacturing sites in china 

we are a market leader in the brominated flame retardants business and our most significant competitors are chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd industrial products division or israel chemicals we are also a market leader in the phosphorusbased flame retardants business and in the mineralbased flame retardants business our most significant competitors in the phosphorusbased flame retardants business are israel chemicals jiangsu yoke technology co ltd and zhejiang wansheng chemical co ltd in our mineralbased flame retardants business our most significant competitors include jm huber corporation kyowa chemical industry co ltd and nabaltec gmbh we are a market leader in the plastic additives business and our most significant competitors are basf corporation chemtura corporation and songwon industrial co ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our polymer solutions operations are bromine bisphenola phenol benzene caustic soda phosphorus oxychloride alumina trihydrate polystyrene isobutylene and phosphorous derivatives most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

the bromine we use in our polymer solutions segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited or jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we now have a joint venture with weifang sinobrom import and export company ltd or sinobrom in china that allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 

we entered into a range of phosphorus derivative supply agreements with rhodia sa as part of the acquisition of the rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business in 2003

catalysts 

our catalysts segment includes our refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts businesses 

refinery catalysts our two main refinery catalysts product lines are hydroprocessing catalysts or hpc and fluidized catalytic cracking or fcc catalysts and additives in renewable noncrude based fuels we have also launched new catalysts for customers along with ongoing research and development initiatives with additional potential customers 

hpc catalysts are primarily used to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products as well as to convert heavy feedstock into lighter more valuable products fcc catalysts assist in the cracking of petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as fuels and petrochemical feedstock our fcc additives are used to remove sulfur in gasoline and to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield and to boost octane in gasoline we offer more than 90 different hpc catalysts products and more than 70 different fcc catalysts and additives products to our customers 

polyolefin catalysts  we manufacture aluminum and magnesiumalkyls which are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers which are used in the preparation of organic intermediates we also produce metallocenesinglesite catalysts which aid in the development and production of new polymers that increase impact strength clarity and melt characteristics of plastic films we are continuing to build on our organometallics base and to expand the portfolio of products and capabilities we offer our customers 

customers 

our catalysts segment customers include multinational corporations such as exxonmobil corporation royal dutch shell plc and chevron corporation independent petroleum refining companies such as valero energy corporation and tesoro petroleum corporation and national petroleum refining companies such as saudi aramco mobil refinery company ltd petróleo brasileiro sa and petróleos mexicanos 

we estimate that there are currently approximately 450 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 3000 hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to three years 

competition 

our catalysts segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace through our research and development programs we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

we are a market leader in the hpc and fcc catalysts markets and our major competitors in the hpc catalysts market include criterion catalysts and technologies wr grace  coadvanced refining technologies and haldor topsoe our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market include wr grace  co and basf corporation some of our major catalysts competitors have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction our major competitors in the polyolefin market include akzo nobel nv chemtura corporation tosoh corporation and wr grace  co 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alpha olefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin rare earths molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility certain critical raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility despite our mitigating efforts for example molybdenum prices averaged 2930lb in 2008 but significantly declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 to end the year at 985lb in 2009 prices averaged 1205lb and finished the year at 1224lb while in 2010 prices averaged 1577lb and finished the year at 1702lb our profitability may be affected if we are unable to recover significant raw material costs from our customers

fine chemistry 

our fine chemistry formerly fine chemicals segment consists of two categories performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

performance chemicals performance chemicals include products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids mercury control paper manufacturing water purification beef and poultry processing and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides disinfectants and sanitizers potassiumbased products used in industrial applications alkenyl succinic anhydride used in papersizing formulations and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications we sell these products to customers throughout the world for use in personal care products automotive insulation foundry bricks and other industrial products 

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemistry products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs 

our most significant pharmaceutical bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

we will continue to sell methyl bromide in our current markets throughout 2011 as current regulations allow with similar criticaluse allowances compared to 2010 in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the us western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for “critical uses” where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by the us environmental protection agency or epa the us submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

customers 

our fine chemistry segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling and oil services water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies 

pricing for many of our fine chemistry products and services is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

competition 

our fine chemistry segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the fine chemistry marketplace 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we are a market leader in the brominebased products groups and primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers chemtura corporation and israel chemicals we are a leading producer of pharmaceutical bulk actives  ie  ibuprofen and propofol and we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation lonza clariant ltd and cilag ag however there is increasing competition from asian sources we are seeking to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new high quality innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our fine chemistry operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alpha olefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

the bromine that we use in our fine chemistry segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we now have our sinobrom joint venture in china that allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service complementing this program are regional albemarle sales personnel around the world who serve numerous additional customers within north america europe the middle east india asia pacific russia africa and latin america we also use more than 60 selected distributors commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer solutions is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles such as our newly introduced earthwise tm brand which provides polymer solutions products that are greatly enhanced in both end product performance and environmental responsibility plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and valueadded plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

catalysts research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers our polyolefin catalysts customers and the developing markets for advanced biofuels refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the polyolefin area we are focused primarily on developing catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems for polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers for biofuel production we work closely with customers to develop sustainable and efficient liquid fuels from renewable resources including the supply of catalysts for the production of highperformance biodiesel 

the primary focus of our fine chemistry research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants 

we have recognized research and development expenses of 584 million 609 million and 673 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2010 we owned approximately 1600 active us and foreign patents and had approximately 1500 pending us and foreign patent applications we also have acquired rights under the patents and inventions of others through licenses and license our patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees and we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2010 with an occupational injury and illness rate of 054 for albemarle employees and nested contractors 

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new requirements under the european commission’s proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern  such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic or cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic or pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative or vpvb and endocrine disruptors will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2009 one of our products was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern under authorization hexabromocyclododecane or hbcd our sales of hbcd approximate 1 of our total annual net sales 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation for example in 2009 the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july 1 2010 and in televisions and computers after july 1 2012 the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january 1 2011 in 2010 the state of maine broadened existing restrictions on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether to include its use in plastic pallets effective january 1 2012 also the european union’s existing restrictions on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment have been copied by the republic of india and are likely to be adopted in the people’s republic of china as well in december 2009 we along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal in cooperation with the epa from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years a similar agreement was reached later with canada bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several us states 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations in addition we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws we may have liability as a potentially responsible party or prp with respect to active offsite locations under cercla or state equivalents we have sought to resolve our liability as a prp at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability our estimates could change moreover liability under the cercla and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs our understanding of the financial strength of other prps has been considered where appropriate in estimating our liabilities accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve discussed above our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury andor property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment in addition some of our current properties are or have been used for industrial purposes which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation personal injury andor property damage while we conduct our operations so as to minimize the risk of incurring such losses the nature of our business and the types of operations in which we engage create a potential for such losses to occur these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury wrongful death property damage loss of production pollution and other environmental damages depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents it is possible that the company’s operating costs insurability and relationships with customers employees and regulators could be impaired in particular our customers may elect not to purchase our product if they view our safety record as unacceptable this could also cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues however we believe that the likelihood of an environmentalrelated catastrophic occurrence or a series of occurrences that could materially affect the company’s financial position or competitiveness is low 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters we may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations it is also possible that other developments such as increasingly strict environmental laws regulations and orders of regulatory agencies as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future as this information becomes available or other relevant developments occur we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly while there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur based upon our evaluation and experience to date we believe our reserves are adequate we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 45 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities our catalysts segment seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as biofuels gastoliquids and others as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to invest in and expand our product offerings of alternative fuel technologies as a result of the investments in alternative fuel technology products and services to date and our continued focus on these growth areas we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted see also page 14 for further discussion on climate change in item 1a risk factors

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if a global recession continues for significant future periods or deteriorates significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example our fine chemistry segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more costeffective catalysts products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we and our joint ventures currently have over 30 facilities located outside the us including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany hungary india italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

in addition certain of our joint ventures operate and we have ongoing capital projects in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture a delay or cancellation of those capital projects and negatively impact our future growth and profitability our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets liabilities net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we may become subject potentially some form of us federal regulation is forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co 2  andor “cap and trade” legislation additionally some of our operations are within other jurisdictions that 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions for example we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol is set to expire in 2012 and global attention is focused on the development of a successor global policy framework the outcome of new legislation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional regulation additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs or additional taxes or reduced emission allowances we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations through our contractual terms which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether which was banned for some applications in the states of washington maine oregon and vermont in 2009 the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july 1 2010 and in televisions and computers after july 1 2012 the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january 1 2011 in december 2009 we along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal in cooperation with the epa from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years a similar agreement was reached later with canada bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several us states 

norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april 2008 except for certain transportation applications on april 1 2008 the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption as a consequence the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july 1 2008 in 2010 the republic of india decided to adopt similar legislation effective january 1 2012 in 2010 approximately 1 of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 

additionally agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants including decabromodiphenyl ether hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants in 2009 the united nations’ unece agency decided that hexabromocyclododecane meets the technical requirements to be considered a “persistent organic pollutant” or pop additional evaluations will be conducted before any action is taken against the sale of hexabromocyclododecane our expectation is that the sale of hexabromocyclododecane could be banned in europe as soon as 2014

additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters occur in the future they could negatively affect our ability to operate and the results of operations at our sites in this region 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us 

as of december 31 2010 we had 4020 employees approximately 18 of our 2055 us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2011 2012 and 2013 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include

although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us the netherlands germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 93 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2010 we made 700 million of voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans also in january 2011 we made another voluntary contribution of 500 million to these plans we anticipate that the funded status of each of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans will be at least 80 in 2011 and therefore the plans should not be subject to benefit limitations in conjunction with the pension protection act of 2006 additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2011 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns thencurrent interest rates and legislative changes the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as an american chemistry council member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on a weighted average interest rate of 44 and outstanding borrowings at december 31 2010 of 8609 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 375 million a hypothetical 10 change approximately 23 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to the variable portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 03 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

conditions in the global credit markets have improved markedly over the past 12 months nevertheless more stringent credit standards and heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of prospective regulatory changes regarding capitalization and other requirements on major financial institutions are factors likely to prevent us from obtaining terms comparable to those prevalent prior to the recent global recession as of december 31 2010 we had no significant obligations maturing before 2013 availability under existing committed credit facilities is expected to be sufficient for our working capital and capital expenditure needs

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our march 2007 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our march 2007 credit agreement the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 43 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa1 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding andor materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 

credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results actions that we take their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures as a result our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions in addition there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of nonus subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 

the instruments governing our indebtedness do not limit our acquisitions and may allow us to incur additional indebtedness including indebtedness in relation to acquisitions 

we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement and expand our distribution network the terms of our indebtedness do not limit the number or scale of acquisitions that we may complete because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy

efforts ongoing productivity improvements and strong balance sheet position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions while softening the negative impact of any temporary disruption in the economy 

2010 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 outlook 

we continue to see encouraging signs in the global markets that we serve with strong demand contributing to an already tight supply situation for many of our products our businesses are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in both recovering markets and emerging markets that bring new demand we continue to monitor key economic indicators and work to manage potential headwinds such as increased raw material and energy costs pensions and other personnel costs we ended 2010 with strong earnings and we expect the same fundamentals that drove our 2010 performance to remain in place and position us to deliver solid earnings growth in 2011 

polymer solutions we expect continued demand strength in consumer electronics automotive and commercial construction to drive volume improvements in our fire safety business in 2011 improving global standards of living coupled with the potential for 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

increasingly stringent firesafety regulations and global climate initiatives should drive continued longterm demand for fire safety products 

our presence in china should continue to grow with the newly added capacity of our antioxidants facility in shanghai also our phosphorousbased flameretardant production capability at our nanjing site scheduled for expansion in 2011 is well positioned to serve the asia pacific construction and electronics markets 

greenarmor tm  the first earthwise tm product from our polymer solutions segment is expected to be commercially available in 2011 the earthwise tm portfolio is expected to grow to include products from other business units and segments of albemarle 

successful implementation of pricing initiatives is expected to help offset raw material inflation and fund further investment in new products and technologies 

catalysts we expect increased volumes and stable pricing to drive growth in our catalysts segment during 2011 increased global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements are expected to drive growth in our refinery catalyst business we expect growth in our polyolefin catalysts division to come from growing global demand for specialty plastics particularly in asia and the middle east our fcc refinery catalysts business has seen significant price increases in rare earth materials due to recent chinese export quotas we have taken appropriate steps to maintain sufficient security of supply for the foreseeable future as well as implemented cost passthrough mechanisms that will help sustain current profitability levels for this business as we enter into 2011 

new market penetrations and introduction of innovative costeffective catalysts products for the refining and polyolefins industries are expected to contribute to the segment’s strong performance in 2011 we believe our focus on advanced product development in catalysts is achieving commercial success we have introduced new valueadded refining solutions and technologies that enable refiners to increase yields a critical advantage for refiners our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned which enables us to continue to bring innovative technologies to the market additionally we expect to continue exploring new alternative fuel opportunities by partnering with leading renewable fuels technology developers who can benefit from albemarle’s catalysis expertise 

we expect to leverage our existing positions in the middle east asia and brazil along with our joint ventures to capitalize on growth opportunities and further develop our leading position in those emerging markets our joint venture in saudi arabia with sabic expected to be operational in 2012 positions us to lead in the key middle east developing region and the fast growing middle east polyolefins market construction at our recently acquired yeosu south korea site is progressing well existing assets allowed us to rapidly develop research and smallscale production facilities adding immediate value to the metallocene polyolefin and high brightness led regional markets intermediate commercial operations at the site are expected to begin in mid2011 with the commercial facility being fully operational in 2012 to meet regional growth in metallocene polyolefins tmg markets for high brightness led 

fine chemistry our fine chemistry segment continues to benefit from the rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions in our performance chemicals sector we expect strong growth in 2011 as demand across our bromine franchise continues to expand new applications widen the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives and global supply remains tight our completion fluids business has started to regain traction and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2011 as global drilling activity increases to satisfy higher fuel demand additionally we are encouraged by longterm drivers in the us and china for our mercury control business we are positioned to provide these markets with sensible sustainable solutions to meet new regulatory demands including emission prevention and control directives for coalfueled power plants in the us and china and waste reduction initiatives in the cement production industry in connection with the new cementmact mercury emission standard we expect to sustain the healthy margins achieved as we closed out 2010 with continued focus on the two strategic areas in our fine chemistry segment – maximizing our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and continued growth of our fine chemistry services business we expect favorable fixed cost absorption and continued high levels of operation of our bromine assets in 2011 

we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we believe the global supplydemand gap will continue to tighten as demand for existing and new uses of bromine expand and global supply remains tight we are positioned to expand capacity as needed at our lowcost production facilities 

our fine chemistry services product pipeline is strong and opportunities are expanding our pharmaceutical and crop protection businesses continue to deliver solid results we expect product development opportunities to continue such as partnering with exxonmobil to make a specialty lubricant and with pharmaceutical developers like siga technologies in their manufacture of the

st246 smallpox drug our technical expertise manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries we believe we will continue to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other we continue to focus on cash generation working capital management and process efficiency while monitoring headwinds from pensions and employee benefit costs in addition we will continue to focus on tax efficiencies however incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates than was the case in 2010 we believe our global effective tax rate for 2011 should be approximately 25 but will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned we increased our quarterly dividend payout in the first quarter of 2011 to 165 cents per share under our existing share repurchase program we expect to periodically repurchase shares in 2011 on an opportunistic basis in addition we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint

comparison of 2010 to 2009 

net sales 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we reported net sales of 236 billion which was an 18 increase compared to net sales of 201 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was due primarily to an increase in volumes in all segments which benefited from the global economic recovery as well as favorable pricemix partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts mainly the weaker euro volumes and pricemix had a positive impact on sales of 17 and 2 respectively partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 

polymer solutions net sales increased 2065 million or 30 for the year ended december 31 2010 versus the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly due to the impact of higher volumes of 25 and favorable pricingmix of 6 offset in part by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1 catalysts net sales for the year 2010 increased 819 million or 10 compared to 2009 due mainly to higher volumes fine chemistry net sales increased 689 million or 14 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to last year mainly due to the impact of higher volumes of 17 partly offset by unfavorable pricemix impacts of 2 and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 for a detailed discussion of revenues and segment income for each segment see “segment information overview” below 

gross profit 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our gross profit increased 2621 million or 54 from the corresponding 2009 period due mainly to sales volume improvements favorable production rate impacts on cost in our bromine franchise and improved realization of metals costs in hpc refinery catalysts we operated our manufacturing facilities at higher rates in 2010 than prior year to meet current sales demands contributing to favorable profit effects from higher fixed cost absorption with only minor offsetting increases in manufacturing spending due to the increased production levels these key factors contributed to overall improvement in our gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2010 to 316 up from 241 for the year 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 531 million or 25 from the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher employee related expenses during 2010 versus the corresponding period in 2009 also sga expenses for 2009 included adjustments of 70 million associated with the reversal of certain longterm employee benefit accruals as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 112 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 106 for the corresponding period in 2009 

research and development expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our research and development rd expenses decreased 25 million or 4 from the year ended december 31 2009 this decrease was primarily due to reductions in discretionary spending partly offset with continuing investment in the technologies supporting our growth programs across our segments as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 25 for the year ended december 31 2010 in comparison to 30 for the corresponding period in 2009 

restructuring and other charges 

the year ended december 31 2010 included first quarter 2010 charges amounting to 70 million 46 million after income taxes for restructuring costs related principally to planned reductions in force at our bergheim germany site the year ended december 31 2009 includes 116 million in pretax charges 76 million after income taxes for restructuring and other costs related principally to planned reductions in force and to the writeoff of certain assets at our arkansas facility the programs associated with these charges have and will continue to yield favorable impacts in our reported operating costs in future reporting periods we have and will continue to fund the majority of the obligations associated with these programs with cash flow generated from operating activities 

port de bouc facility disposition charges 

the year ended december 31 2009 included charges amounting to 124 million 82 million after income taxes that related to the costs of a final contract settlement arising from the 2008 divestiture of the port de bouc france facility monetary obligations associated with these charges were substantially settled in 2009 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 255 million comparable with the corresponding 2009 period amount of 246 million

other income expenses net 

other income expenses net for the year ended december 31 2010 was favorable 42 million compared to 2009 due primarily to higher net foreign currency exchange gains and other miscellaneous items in the current year offset in part by lower interest income 

income tax expense benefit 

our effective tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors where income is earned the level of income relative to available tax credits and tax planning opportunities available to us for 2010 our effective income tax rate was 236 compared to 44 for 2009 the 2009 period was impacted by 228 million in tax benefits comprised mainly from the settlement of the internal revenue service or irs tax audits for the tax years 2005 through 2007 

the significant differences between the us federal statutory income tax rate on pretax income and the effective income tax rate for 2010 and 2009 respectively are as follows 

 

 equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 380 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 223 million in 2009 this increase of 157 million was due primarily to higher overall equity earnings from our various catalysts segment joint ventures particularly in our nippon ketjen joint venture due mainly to favorable material input costs in the current year our fcc sa joint venture due to lower variable input costs compared to the prior year and the inclusion of the equity results of our stannica llc joint venture which we deconsolidated on january 1 2010 we also had higher equity earnings from our magnifin joint venture in our polymer solutions segment due to increased demand in the automotive sector 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 136 million compared to 113 million in 2009 this increase was due primarily to 56 million in higher noncontrolling interest earnings of jbc as a result of improvements in bromine franchise sales volumes offset in part by the impacts of the deconsolidation of our stannica llc joint venture which reported 37 million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2009 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation 

net income attributable to albemarle corporation increased to 3237 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 1784 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to sales and production volume increases favorable fixed cost absorption across our businesses favorable metals cost realization in our hpc refinery catalysts business favorable equity in net income of our unconsolidated investments lower special items lower rd spending and favorable other income expense net these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher sga costs higher income taxes higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher interest and financing expenses 

segment information overview we have identified three reportable segments in accordance with current accounting guidance our polymer solutions segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas our catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas our fine chemistry segment is comprised of the 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas segment income represents operating profit adjusted for special items equity in net income of unconsolidated investments and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on january 1 2010 we sold a 10 interest in our previously consolidated investment in stannica llc resulting in a change in accounting for this subsidiary to the equity method effective june 30 2008 we acquired the remaining 25 of the jinhai antioxidants business joint ventures thereby eliminating the related noncontrolling interest segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and allocations for certain corporate costs 

 

  percentage calculation is not meaningful 

our segment information includes measures we refer to as “segment operating profit” and “segment income” which are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” the company has reported segment operating profit and segment income because management believes that these financial measures provide transparency to investors and enable periodtoperiod comparability of financial performance segment operating profit and segment income should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or net income attributable to albemarle corporation respectively as determined in accordance with gaap

 polymer solutions 

polymer solutions segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 9037 million up 2065 million or 30 in comparison to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly due to the impact of higher volumes of 25 net of 429 million in unfavorable net sales impact from the january 1 2010 stannica llc deconsolidation and favorable pricemix impacts of 6 offset in part by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 mainly the weaker euro the increase in volumes directly resulting from improved economic conditions over 2009 was primarily in our fire safety portfolio in the consumer electronics automotive and construction sectors while our stabilizers and curatives product lines also showed higher volumes in antioxidants and curatives segment income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 1983 million versus 614 million for 2009 the yearoveryear improvement in operating performance was due mainly to the sales volume and pricemix improvements noted above as well as higher production volumes which contributed to favorable fixed cost absorption also polymer solutions segment income for 2010 benefited from higher equity in net income of 52 million from its unconsolidated investment magnifin due to increased demand in the automotive sector compared to the prior year as well as the favorable impact of the january 1 2010 deconsolidation of stannica llc which reported 37 million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the polymer solutions segment results during the year ended december 31 2009 these favorable items were partially offset by 40 million in higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulting from improved performance in our jbc joint venture 

catalysts 

catalysts segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 8900 million an increase of 819 million or 10 versus the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was due mainly to higher volumes in refinery catalysts particularly fcc refinery catalysts due to higher refinery operating rates and alternative fuels as well as an increase in volumes in polyolefin catalysts arising from stronger customer demand over the challenged 2009 year catalysts segment income increased 67 or 1001 million to 2488 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly in our hpc business due mainly to improved realization of metals cost passthrough impacts yearoveryear as well as favorable sales 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

and production volumes in fcc refinery catalysts and alternative fuels and favorable volumes in polyolefin catalysts catalysts segment income for the year ended december 31 2010 also benefited 107 million from higher equity in net income from unconsolidated joint ventures particularly in nippon ketjen due mainly to favorable material input costs versus the prior year our fcc sa joint venture due to lower variable input costs and favorable equity results from our stannica llc joint venture investment which we deconsolidated on january 1 2010 and whose results were previously reported in the polymer solutions segment in prior years these favorable impacts on segment income for catalysts were offset in part by higher sgard spending of 105 million compared to the corresponding period in 2009 

fine chemistry 

fine chemistry segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 5690 million an increase of 689 million or 14 versus the year ended december 31 2009 with higher volumes mainly in performance chemicals resulting from overall improved customer demand contributing 17 of the increase these favorable volume impacts net of 72 million in unfavorable sales impacts from the july 30 2010 divestiture of our teesport uk site were partly offset by unfavorable pricemix impacts of 2 and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 1 mainly the weaker euro fine chemistry segment income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 721 million up 250 million or 53 from 2009 these improved results were due to higher sales and production volumes in the segment mainly in performance chemicals offset in part by higher sgard spending of 64 million and 19 million in higher net income in noncontrolling interests resulting mainly from improved performance in our jbc joint venture 

corporate and other 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our corporate and other expense was 730 million versus 358 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs also the year ended december 31 2009 included adjustments of 78 million associated with the reversal of certain longterm employee benefit accruals reflected mainly in sga expenses

net sales 

for 2009 we recorded net sales of 201 billion a decrease of 4617 million or 19 compared to net sales of 247 billion for 2008 this decrease was due primarily to lower volumes and unfavorable pricemix across our operating segments including metals pass through impacts overall volumes declined 12 with another 5 decline due to pricemix compared to 2008 

our polymer solutions segment’s net sales for 2009 decreased 2183 million or 24 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower volumes of 19 mix of 4 and unfavorable foreign currency of 1 our catalysts segment’s net sales decreased 1157 million or 13 due mainly to an 8 decline in pricemix including metals pass through impacts a 4 decrease in volume and a 1 decrease related to foreign currency our fine chemistry segment’s net sales decreased 1277 million or 20 primarily due to lower volumes of 16 unfavorable pricemix of 3 and a decrease of 1 in foreign currency 

gross profit 

for 2009 our gross profit decreased 1238 million or 20 from 2008 to 4839 million due mainly to volume declines unfavorable production rate impacts on cost in our bromine franchise and high cost metals impacts on hpc refinery catalysts offset mainly by favorable manufacturing cost spending resulting from our recent cost saving actions during 2009 we operated our manufacturing facilities at reduced rates to control inventory levels contributing to unfavorable profit effects from lower fixed cost absorption overall these factors contributed to our decline in gross profit margin for 2009 to 241 from 246 in 2008 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for 2009 our sga expenses decreased 425 million or 17 from 2008 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs and discretionary spending resulting from our recent cost saving actions including first quarter 2009 adjustments of 70 million associated with the reversal of certain longterm employee benefit accruals as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 106 in 2009 versus 103 in 2008

 polymer solutions 

our polymer solutions segment recorded net sales for 2009 of 6972 million down 2183 million or 24 versus 2008 this decline was primarily due to lower volumes of 19 mix of 4 and unfavorable foreign currency of 1 mainly strengthening of the us dollar the decrease in volumes was primarily in our flame retardants portfolio as a result of softness in the consumer electronics automotive and construction sectors as well as unfavorable mix the decrease was also attributable to volume declines in our stabilizers and curatives business due mainly to overall reduced demand in the antioxidants and special intermediates product sectors as well as unfavorable mix impacts polymer solutions segment income decreased by 31 to 614 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 due mainly to lower sales volumes as well as lower production volumes which contributed to unfavorable fixed cost absorption unfavorable product mix in stabilizers and curatives and impacts from foreign currency exchange rates due mainly to the stronger us dollar partially offset by lower discretionary spending including 155 million in lower sgard department spending for the segment in connection with our recent cost saving actions 

catalysts 

our catalysts segment recorded net sales for 2009 of 8081 million down 1157 million or 13 versus 2008 this overall decrease was due mainly to an 8 overall decline in pricemix mainly from lower hpc metals price pass through impacts offset in part by pricemix gains in fcc refinery catalysts also volume decreases contributed 4 of the net sales decline in the segment mainly in fcc refinery catalysts due to lower refinery operating rates unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 1 were attributable mainly to the strengthening of the us dollar segment income for catalysts decreased 140 million or 9 to 1486 million due mainly to pricemix impacts mainly from unfavorable metals price pass through impacts on hpc refinery catalysts partially offset by 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

lower discretionary spending including 150 million in reduced spending for sgard departmental costs for the catalysts segment in connection with our recent cost reduction programs 

fine chemistry 

our fine chemistry segment recorded net sales for 2009 of 5001 million down 1277 million or 20 versus 2008 of this decrease 16 was primarily due to lower volumes resulting from overall weak demand in our bromine franchise and our fine chemistry services business with both businesses directly affected by the global economic downturn seen in 2009 also unfavorable pricemix impacts of 3 affected 2009 segment net sales as well as impacts of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 1 mainly due to the stronger us dollar fine chemistry segment income for 2009 was 471 million down 414 million or 47 compared to 2008 due mainly to lower sales volumes and reduced production volumes which also contributed to unfavorable fixed cost absorption these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower discretionary spending in the segment including 51 million in lower sgard department spending in connection with our recent cost reduction programs 

corporate and other 

for 2009 our corporate and other expenses decreased 146 million or 29 to 357 million from 2008 this decrease was primarily due to first quarter 2009 adjustments of 78 million associated with the reversal of certain longterm employee benefit accruals of which 70 million is included in “selling general and administrative expenses” in our consolidated statement of income as well as other reductions in discretionary spending total year 2009 corporate selling general and administrativerd spending was favorable versus the corresponding 2008 period by 133 million based on lower employee related expenses and other discretionary spending savings as a result of our cost reduction efforts 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts where the company incurs preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return borrowing costs and expected equity premiums the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 47 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2010 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rates for the us plans we establish a range of reasonable rates based on methods developed by subject matter experts that reflect current market conditions for 2010 we relied on methods developed by citigroup aonhewitt and milliman to establish a range of acceptable discount rates based on authoritative accounting guidance these methods calculate discount rates based on highquality bond data and the projected plan cash flows we believe our selected discount rates accurately reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2010 measurement date 

in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans we relied on aonhewitt methods including the aonhewitt topquartile and a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aagraded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 

at december 31 2010 the weightedaverage discount rate was reduced for the pension plans from 577 to 540 and for the other postretirement plans from 570 to 530 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2010 measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments for the year 2010 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 825 compared to 875 for 2009 there has been 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

no change to the assumed rate of return on us pension plan assets effective january 1 2011 also there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 70 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2010 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 393 from 390 for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase remained unchanged at 40 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2010 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2010 the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees remained unchanged for 2011 the assumed trend rate for pre65 coverage is 75 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 50 in the year 2019 the 2011 assumed trend rate for post65 coverage is 120 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 50 in the year 2020 

a 1 increase or decrease in the us health care cost trend rate would not have a material effect on the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 

 

  

 of the 5150 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2010 694 million or 135 are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 17 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 47 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008 since the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through 2007 or for any us state income tax audit prior to 2001 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2002 during 2010 we completed a tax audit for one of our belgian companies for the 2007 tax year during 2009 we completed the tax audits for the following tax jurisdictions and respective tax years belgium 2007 and 2008 for one belgian entity and germany 2002 through 2005 no significant tax was assessed as a result of these audits we were informed in february 2011 that the belgian tax authorities would commence an audit of one of our belgian companies for 2009 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 08 million as a result of closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting status and updates are provided to executive management and our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business and functional groups we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets funding working capital and repayment of debt also in 2010 we made 801 million in total contributions to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and we made approximately 400 million in total contributions to these plans in each of 2009 and 2008 historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by funds from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our march 2007 credit agreement which is discussed below to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash and cash equivalents increased by 2209 million to 5297 million at december 31 2010 as compared to our ending balance at december 31 2009 of 3088 million our cash flows from operations provided 3313 million 3585 million and 3272 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the decrease in cash flows from operations in 2010 versus 2009 of 272 million was primarily due to an increase in working capital mainly inventories and accounts receivable in connection with the global economic recovery and pension contributions offset in part by the strong increase in profitability of our businesses the increase of 313 million in operating cash flows for 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to working capital reduction programs put in place during the 2009 economic downturn partially offset by corresponding decreases in profitability 

in 2010 our operating cash flows funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 755 million dividends to shareholders of 496 million repurchases of common stock of 149 million and normal debt repayments during the year additionally our cash balances in 2010 were unfavorably impacted 126 million as a result of the january 1 2010 deconsolidation of our stannica llc joint venture further we raised approximately 473 million in borrowings in 2010 including 3469 million in net proceeds from our 45 senior notes offering in december 2010 in the fourth quarter 2010 we used the collective proceeds of these borrowings to pay down 3080 million in outstanding borrowings on our march 2007 credit agreement fund a contribution of 500 million to our domestic qualified pension plans and for other general corporate purposes in january 2011 we funded another contribution of 500 million to our domestic qualified pension plans from the proceeds of these borrowings 

our cash flows from operations in 2009 were used mainly for funding capital expenditures of 1008 million for plant machinery and equipment 1200 million in net repayments of debt 444 million in dividends to shareholders and 164 million in obligations arising from the 2008 port de bouc facility divestiture for the year 2008 our cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of 1637 million which consisted principally of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment and acquisitions our remaining operating cash flows in 2008 were combined with net proceeds from borrowings of 2071 million to repurchase 1690 million of our common stock dividends to shareholders totaling 423 million and for other corporate uses 

net current assets increased 3052 million to 9840 million at december 31 2010 from 6788 million at december 31 2009 the increase in net current assets was due primarily to increases in cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventory and a decrease in the current portion of longterm debt partially offset by increases in income taxes payable and accrued expenses 

capital expenditures were 755 million 1008 million and 997 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 150 million in 2011 for capacity increase cost reduction and continuity of operations projects 

while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation working capital management and capital spending in light of the recent economic downturn seen in 2009 we are confident that as we enter into 2011 we will have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements

longterm debt 

we currently have outstanding 3250 million of 510 senior notes due in 2015 and 3500 million of 450 senior notes due in 2020 or the senior notes the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2015 and 25 basis points for the senior notes maturing in 2020 plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption however the 2020 senior notes are redeemable as a whole or in part at our option at any time on or after three months prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption holders of the 2020 senior notes may require us to purchase such notes at 101 upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the related indenture agreement 

the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries we believe that as of december 31 2010 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the covenants of the indentures governing the senior notes 

for additional funding and liquidity purposes we currently maintain a 6750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving senior credit facility which we refer to as the march 2007 credit agreement the march 2007 credit agreement provides for an additional 2000 million in credit upon additional loan commitments by our existing andor additional lenders the total spread and fees can range from 032 to 0675 over the london interbank offered rate or libor applicable to the currency of the borrowing and are based on our credit rating as determined by the major rating agencies there were no borrowings outstanding under the march 2007 credit agreement at december 31 2010 borrowings under the march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate which was a weighted average of 061 during the threemonth period ended december 31 2010 

in march 2008 we exercised an option under the march 2007 credit agreement to extend the maturity date from march 2012 to march 2013 lenders representing 874 of the commitments or 590 million out of 675 million approved the extension no other changes to the agreement were part of the extension and no fees other than attorney fees were paid as a result of the extension 85 million and 590 million in commitments now have a maturity date of march 2012 and march 2013 respectively 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants i consolidated funded debt as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement as of the end of any fiscal quarter ii consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement must be greater than or equal to 7500 million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the us and iii with the exception of liens specified in our march 2007 credit agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the march 2007 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement we believe that as of december 31 2010 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the march 2007 credit agreement 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 8519 million at december 31 2010 compared to 7764 million at december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 we had the ability to borrow an additional 6750 million under our march 2007 credit agreement and 1163 million under other existing lines of credit we have the ability to refinance our borrowings under these credit lines under our march 2007 credit agreement as applicable therefore these amounts are classified as longterm debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 342 million at december 31 2010 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our projected contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment various take or pay and throughput agreements and obligations under our existing credit agreements based on projected borrowings in thousands 

 

  

  amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions we have determined that the expected 2011 contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans should approximate 546 million we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we have made 768 million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december 31 2010 

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in “other noncurrent liabilities” totaled 219 million and 223 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in “other assets” totaled 123 million and 149 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash provided by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our march 2007 credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures make pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments renew their extensions of credit or provide new financing while the corporate bond market remains strong availability of bank debt is far more limited than prior to the market disruptions of 2008 and 2009 which severely impacted many financial institutions if bank debt remains relatively less prevalent we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature it is also possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by market or counterparty factors at a time when we would need or desire to do so which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions in addition our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

at december 31 2010 we had the ability to borrow in excess of 7913 million under our march 2007 credit agreement and other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our march 2007 credit agreement with generally strong cash generative businesses and no significant debt maturities before 2013 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 5297 million as of december 31 2010 which represent an important source of our liquidity our cash is invested in shortterm investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to our operations 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 348 million 363 million and 416 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2010 totaled approximately 138 million down 18 million from 156 million at december 31 2009 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 “legal proceedings” on page 21 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 78 million 114 million and 214 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new accounting guidance relating to separating consideration in multipledeliverable revenue arrangements under this guidance multipledeliverable arrangements will be accounted for separately rather than on a combined basis by selecting the best evidence of selling price among vendorspecific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or estimated selling price the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 new accounting guidance was issued by the fasb that requires additional disclosures about amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and the reasons therefore additionally entities are now required to present separately information about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable level 3 inputs the amendments also clarified that entities should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class or subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position and entities should disclose information about inputs and valuation techniques for level 2 and level 3 fair value measurements whether recurring or nonrecurring these amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level 3 inputs which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years the provisions of this guidance that became effective for us january 1 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the provisions that will be effective for us january 1 2011 but do not expect that they will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net liability position of 49 million at december 31 2010 we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2010 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of 164 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in an increase of 113 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2010 without reflecting the underlying monetary exposures the portfolio is hedging the effects of exchange movements on those anticipated transactions would be expected to mitigate the impacts implied by our sensitivity analysis 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of 1495 million and 4392 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively these borrowings represented 17 and 54 of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of 225 and 083 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively a hypothetical 10 change approximately 23 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 03 million as of december 31 2010 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs the current credit spreads provided for under the march 2007 credit agreement which were negotiated prior to the recent global recession will likely not be obtainable in the event that we would need to refinance our credit facilities 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market from time to time we enter into natural gas hedge contracts with one or more major financial institutions for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and are not entered into for trading purposes at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemical products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs 

our most significant pharmaceutical bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

we will continue to sell methyl bromide in our current markets throughout 2010 as current regulations allow with similar criticaluse allowances compared to 2009 in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the us western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for “critical uses” where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by the us environmental protection agency or epa the us submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

customers 

our fine chemicals segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling and oil services water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies 

pricing for many of our fine chemicals is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

competition 

our fine chemicals segment serves the following geographic markets the americas asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the fine chemicals marketplace 

we are a market leader in the brominebased products groups and primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers chemtura corporation and israel chemicals we are a leading producer of pharmaceutical bulk actives  ie  ibuprofen and propofol and we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation lonza clariant ltd and cilag ag however there is increasing competition from asian and indian sources we are seeking to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new high quality innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our fine chemicals operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alpha olefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the bromine that we use in our fine chemicals segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves in addition we now have our sinobrom joint venture in china which allows us the option to source bromine directly from china’s shandong province brine fields 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service we also use more than 50 selected distributors commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products that benefit society in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and is produced in safe environmentally friendly manufacturing processes green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer solutions is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants which not only meet the higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers but which also have superior toxicological and environmental profiles such as our newly introduced earthwise tm brand which provides polymer solutions that are greatly enhanced in both end product performance and environmental responsibility plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and valueadded plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

catalysts research is focused on the needs of our refinery catalysts customers our polyolefin catalysts customers and the developing markets for advanced biofuels refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the polyolefin area we are focused primarily on developing catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems for polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers for biofuel production we work closely with customers to develop sustainable and efficient liquid fuels from renewable resources including the supply of catalysts for the production of highperformance biodiesel 

the primary focus of our fine chemicals research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of brominebased products for use as biocides in industrial water treatment and food safety applications and as additives used to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants 

we have recognized research and development expenses of 609 million 673 million and 627 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trade names is an important component of our business as of december 31 2009 we owned approximately 1600 active us and foreign patents and had approximately 1700 pending us and foreign patent applications we also have acquired rights under the patents and inventions of others through licenses and license our patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2009 with an occupational injury and illness rate of 034 for albemarle employees and nested contractors 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new requirements under the european commission’s proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern  such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic or cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic or pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative or vpvb and endocrine disruptors will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2009 one of our products was designated by european regulators as a substance of very high concern under authorization hexabromocyclododecane or hbcd our sales of hbcd approximate 1 of our total annual net sales 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain of our products subject to the reach regulations 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation for example in 2009 the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july 1 2010 and in televisions and computers after july 1 2012 the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january 1 2011 in december 2009 we along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal in cooperation with the epa from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years however bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several states and in the us house of representatives 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to them and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated future developments and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 40 

climate change 

the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities our catalysts segment seeks to capitalize on the “green revolution” by 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as biofuels gastoliquids and others as demand for and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase we continue to invest in and expand our product offerings of alternative fuel technologies as a result of the investments in alternative fuel technology products and services to date and our continued focus on these growth areas we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted see also page 14 for further discussion on climate change in item 1a risk factors 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

over the last three years we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries the following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and the volatility and disruption of financial markets could negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic conditions including a stringent credit market which can impact our liquidity as well as the liquidity of our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if a global recession arises and continues for significant future periods or if economic conditions deteriorate significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 

in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example our fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more costeffective 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

catalysts products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states we and our joint ventures currently have approximately 30 facilities located outside the united states including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany hungary india italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries and consolidated joint ventures are reported in the relevant functional currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities because foreign assets and liabilities as well as net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements could result in exchange losses the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese yuan and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we may become subject potentially some form of us federal regulation is forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co2 andor “cap and trade” legislation additionally some of our operations are within other jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions for example we have operations in the european union brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore and the united arab emirates which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol is set to expire in 2012 and global attention is focused on the development of a successor global policy framework the outcome of new legislation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional regulation additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs or additional taxes or reduced emission allowances we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations through our contractual terms which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth furthermore the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely effect our operations 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether which was banned for some applications in the states of washington maine oregon and vermont in 2009 the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july 1 2010 and in televisions and computers after july 1 2012 the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january 1 2011 in december 2009 we along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal in cooperation with the epa from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years however bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several states and in the us house of representatives 

norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april 2008 except for certain transportation applications on april 1 2008 the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption as a consequence the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july 1 2008 in 2009 approximately 1 of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

additionally agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants including decabromodiphenyl ether hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants in 2009 the united nations’ unece agency decided that hexabromocyclododecane meets the technical requirements to be considered a “persistent organic pollutant” or pop additional evaluations will be conducted before any action is taken against the sale of hexabromocyclododecane our expectation is that if no exemptions to the pop ruling are granted the sale of hexabromocyclododecane could be banned in europe as soon as mid2012 

additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on a weighted average interest rate of 28 and outstanding borrowings at december 31 2009 of 8127 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 228 million a hypothetical 10 change approximately 8 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to the variable portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 04 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or our inability to refinance our credit facilities at existing interest rate spreads or at other commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

conditions in the global credit markets have improved in recent months but remain tenuous relative to the credit environment 1824 months ago more stringent credit standards and heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of prospective regulatory changes regarding capitalization and other requirements of major financial institutions are factors that could impede our ability to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms and result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition since we extended the maturity of our march 2007 credit agreement in early 2008 before the recent period of financial and credit market volatility manifested we do not have any significant obligation maturing before 2013 availability under existing committed credit facilities is expected to be sufficient for our working capital and capital expenditure needs 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our march 2007 credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain certain restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our march 2007 credit agreement the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 38 

a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa2 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters occur in the future it could negatively affect our results of operations at our sites in this region 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 

as of december 31 2009 we had 3950 employees approximately 18 of our 2035 us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2010 and 2011 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us the netherlands germany belgium and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 92 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2009 we made a 250 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans we anticipate that the funded status of each of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans will be at least 80 and therefore the plans will not be subject to benefit limitations in conjunction with the pension protection act of 2006 further based on the 250 million contribution made in december 2009 no minimum contribution is expected to be required for 2010 however we may choose to make additional voluntary pension contributions in 2010 contributions after 2010 could vary depending on factors such as asset returns thencurrent interest rates and legislative changes the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as an american chemistry council member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 3 2006 we received a notice of violation or nov from the epa region 4 regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg south carolina the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant we are currently engaged in discussions with the epa seeking to resolve these allegations but no assurances can be given that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both parties any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines penalties capital expenditures or some combination thereof at this time it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of our discussions with the epa or the financial impact which may result therefrom however we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability and premises liability litigation we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages as estimated by our general counsel we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

 2010 outlook 

polymer solutions our restructuring initiatives and operational efficiency improvements coupled with stronger consumer electronics demand are expected to help drive improved profitability of our polymer solutions segment in 2010 in the longer term we believe the increasing standard of living around the globe should drive higher demand for electrical and electronic equipment and new construction and the potential for increasingly stringent firesafety regulations and global climate initiatives should increase the need for insulation materials we remain cautious however on potential volatility in some end markets 

we have a strong presence in china and expect to continue building on the foundation for expanding our business footprint in asia the newly added capacity of our antioxidants facility in shanghai will be online in first quarter 2010 in addition we produce phosphorousbased flameretardants at our nanjing site to serve the asiapacific construction and electronic markets 

a significant result of our investments in research and development is the creation of the earthwise tm family of sustainable products the first earthwise tm product from our polymer solutions segment is a fire safety solution called greenarmor tm  which we expect to be commercially available by late 2010 the earthwise tm portfolio is expected to grow to include products from other business units and segments of albemarle 

catalysts we expect revenue growth in our catalysts segment to be driven by global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as part of the clean air initiatives while we continue to monitor developments in the global economy we expect growth in our catalysts segment in 2010 to come primarily from hpc refills that customers have delayed for some time new product introductions new markets that we penetrate and the continued global growth in our polyolefin catalysts business 

a key strategic focus in our catalysts segment is globalizing and leading in emerging markets we expect to leverage our existing positions in asia brazil and middle east and work with our joint ventures to capitalize on growth opportunities in those regions our joint venture in saudi arabia with sabic expected to be operational in 2012 positions us for the longer term to lead in another key developing market and the fast growing middle east polyolefins market while our current hpc capacity is expected to meet demand growth in this business in the coming years we continue to believe we will need additional hpc capacity in the future to meet expected longer term increased global demand we must also successfully pass through metals costs and ensure optimal inventory levels our focus in fcc catalysts has been on improving margins and delivering highperforming superior quality products to meet the unique demands of refiners 

we are also focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced new valueadded refining solutions and technologies that will enable refiners to increase yields a critical advantage for refiners our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market additionally our alternative fuel technologies business is positioned to serve the rapidly growing biofuels industry we expect to continue exploring new alternative fuel opportunities by partnering with leading technology developers like neste oil corporation on their second generation renewable diesel as well as opportunities in canadian oil sands gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil prices increase 

fine chemicals our fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions in our performance chemicals sector we expect stable growth in 2010 as we continue to expand the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement our two strategic areas of focus in our fine chemicals segment have been to maximize our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business improved bromine asset utilization rates and operational efficiencies will aid in this segment’s profit growth in 2010 

we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets as we supply bromine feed stocks to our polymer solutions segment our profitability is generally impacted as market conditions change in that sector the negative impact from weak market conditions subsided as 2009 closed and we expect continued slow but steady growth in our bromine derivatives also our new fine chemistry services products 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

pipeline is strong and opportunities are expanding our technical expertise manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and maximizing cash generation in addition we will continue to focus on tax efficiency however incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates than was the case in 2009 we believe our global effective tax rate for 2010 should be in the range of 18 to 20 but will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned we also expect increased expense for 2010 from our us pension and other postretirement plans of approximately 15 million based on yearend 2009 discount rates and a reduction in our assumed rate of return on plan assets we increased our quarterly dividend payout in the first quarter of 2010 to 014 per share under our existing share repurchase program we expect to periodically repurchase shares in 2010 on an opportunistic basis in addition we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

comparison of 2009 to 2008 

net sales 

for 2009 we recorded net sales of 201 billion a decrease of 4617 million or 19 compared to net sales of 247 billion for 2008 this decrease was due primarily to lower volumes and unfavorable pricemix across our operating segments including metals pass through impacts overall volumes declined 12 with another 5 decline due to pricemix compared to 2008 

our polymer solutions segment’s net sales for 2009 decreased 2183 million or 24 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower volumes of 19 mix of 4 and unfavorable foreign currency of 1 our catalysts segment’s net sales decreased 1157 million or 13 due mainly to an 8 decline in pricemix including metals pass through impacts a 4 decrease in volume and a 1 decrease related to foreign currency our fine chemicals segment’s net sales decreased 1277 million or 20 primarily due to lower volumes of 16 unfavorable pricemix of 3 and a decrease of 1 in foreign currency for a detailed discussion of revenues and segment income before taxes for each segment see “segment information overview” below 

gross profit 

for 2009 our gross profit decreased 1238 million or 20 from 2008 to 4839 million due mainly to volume declines unfavorable production rate impacts on cost in our bromine franchise and high cost metals impacts on hpc refinery catalysts offset mainly by favorable manufacturing cost spending resulting from our recent cost saving actions during 2009 we operated our manufacturing facilities at reduced rates to control inventory levels contributing to unfavorable profit effects from lower fixed cost absorption overall these factors contributed to our decline in gross profit margin for 2009 to 241 from 246 in 2008 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for 2009 our selling general and administrative or sga expenses decreased 425 million or 17 from 2008 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs and discretionary spending resulting from our recent cost saving actions including first quarter 2009 adjustments of 70 million associated with the reversal of certain longterm employee benefit accruals as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 106 in 2009 versus 103 in 2008 

research and development expenses 

for 2009 our research and development or rd expenses decreased 64 million or 10 from 2008 this decrease was primarily due to reductions in personnel related costs and other discretionary spending offset with continuing investment in technologies supporting our growth programs across our segments as a percentage of net sales our rd expenses were 30 and 27 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

port de bouc facility disposition charges 

our 2008 results included a charge of 385 million 334 million after income taxes related to the divestiture of the port de bouc france facility to international chemical investors group sa effective december 31 2008 the charge was principally due to the disposition of longterm assets of 226 million and other charges totaling 159 million in 2009 we incurred 124 million in additional pretax charges 82 million after income taxes associated with the final contractual settlement of this disposition monetary obligations associated with these charges were substantially settled in 2009 using cash flow from operations 

restructuring and other charges 

the year ended december 31 2009 includes 116 million in pretax charges 76 million after income taxes for restructuring and other costs related principally to planned reductions in force and to the writeoff of certain assets at our arkansas facility our 2008 results include a charge amounting to 258 million 168 million after income taxes related to restructuring activities principally reductions in force at various locations across our operating segments the programs associated with these charges have and will continue to yield favorable impacts in our reported operating costs in 2009 and beyond we will fund the majority of the obligations associated with these charges with cash flow from operations 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for 2009 decreased 136 million from 2008 to 246 million due mainly to lower average interest rates on our march 2007 credit agreement 

other expenses income net 

other expenses income net for 2009 decreased 20 million from 2008 to a net expense of 14 million primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower average interest rates

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of the financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts where the company incurs 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

preproduction design and development costs under longterm supply contracts these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist conversely these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with accounting guidance that requires goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets to not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return borrowing costs and expected equity premiums the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 44 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

under authoritative accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2009 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the expected return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to indices such as the moody’s aa corporate bond index the hewitt topquartile and the citigroup pension discount curve as well as a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing country specific aagraded or better corporate bonds without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve may be based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments at december 31 2009 the weightedaverage discount rate decreased for the pension plans from 645 to 577 and for the other postretirement plans from 655 to 57 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2009 measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments for the year 2009 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 875 consistent with 2008 effective january 1 2010 the assumed rate of return on us pension plan assets has been reduced to 825 there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 70 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2009 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 39 from 411 for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 40 from 425 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2009 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2009 the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees remained unchanged for 2010 the assumed trend rate for pre65 coverage is 80 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 50 in the year 2019 the 2010 assumed trend rate for post65 coverage is 28 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 50 in the year 2020 

the effect of a 1 increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount a 1 decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 

 

  

 in december 2008 the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets this new guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 and requires additional disclosures regarding benefit plan assets including a the investment allocation decision process b the fair value of each major category of plan assets and c the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets we have adopted this guidance and have provided the additional disclosures required upon adoption of the 4253 million total pension and postretirement assets at december 31 2009 659 million or 155 are measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 gains losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets see note 17 “pension plans and other postretirement benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 44 

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008 all us federal income tax issues for the tax years 2005 through 2007 were resolved as of december 2009 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2002 during 2009 we completed the tax audit for the following tax jurisdiction and respective tax years germany 2002 through 2005 and belgium 2007 and 2008 for one of our belgian companies during 2008 we completed the tax audits for the following tax jurisdictions and respective tax years belgium 2005 through 2006 united kingdom 2003 and the netherlands 2004 through 2005 no significant tax was assessed as a result of these audits we were informed in january 2010 that the belgian tax authorities would commence an audit of another of our belgian companies for the years 2007 and 2008 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions relating to a number of issues up to approximately 10 million as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and closure of tax statutes 

we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving affect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team inhouse to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews coordinate the process for these reviews provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting a steering committee comprised of personnel from finance and shared services is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox 404 team status and updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business areas and our shared services group we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets funding working capital and repayment of debt in each of 2009 and 2008 we made a 250 million voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by funds from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our march 2007 credit agreement which is discussed below to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash balance increased by 555 million to 3088 million at december 31 2009 from 2533 million at december 31 2008 for 2009 our operations provided 3585 million of cash compared to 3272 million in 2008 this increase of 313 million is primarily due to improved working capital performance partially offset by a decrease in profitability cash flows from operating activities funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of 1008 million net repayments of debt of 1200 million and dividends to shareholders of 444 million 

net current assets decreased 618 million to 6788 million at december 31 2009 from 7406 million at december 31 2008 the decrease in net current assets was due primarily to a decrease in inventory partially offset by an increase in cash and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2008 were 2533 million up 1227 million from 1306 million at yearend 2007 for 2008 cash flows provided from operating activities of 3272 million funded investing activities of 1637 million which consisted principally of acquisitions and capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment remaining cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds from borrowings of 2071 million were used to purchase 1690 million of our common stock and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 423 million 

capital expenditures in 2009 of 1008 million were used for plant machinery and equipment improvements and were comparable to 2008 expenditures of 997 million we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 100 million in 2010 mainly due to increased capacity cost reduction and continuity of operations while we continue to closely monitor our capital spending and cash generation in light of the recent economic downturn seen in 2009 we are optimistic that as we enter into 2010 we will have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives additionally we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have outstanding 3250 million of 510 senior notes due in 2015 or the senior notes the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 

the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries we believe that as of december 31 2009 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture governing the senior notes 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

for additional funding and liquidity purposes we currently maintain a 6750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving senior credit facility which we refer to as the march 2007 credit agreement the march 2007 credit agreement provides for an additional 2000 million in credit upon additional loan commitments by our existing andor additional lenders the total spreads and fees can range from 032 to 0675 over the london interbank offered rate or libor applicable to the currency of denomination of the borrowing and are based on our credit rating as determined by the major rating agencies there were aggregate borrowings outstanding under the march 2007 credit agreement of 4100 million at december 31 2009 borrowings under the march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate which was a weighted average of 059 during the fourth quarter of 2009 

in march 2008 we exercised an option under the march 2007 credit agreement to extend the maturity date from march 2012 to march 2013 lenders representing 874 of the commitments or 590 million out of 675 million approved the extension no other changes to the agreement were part of the extension and no fees other than attorney fees were paid as a result of the extension 85 million and 590 million in commitments now have a maturity date of march 2012 and march 2013 respectively 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants i consolidated funded debt as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement as of the end of any fiscal quarter ii consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement must be greater than or equal to 7500 million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the us and iii with the exception of liens specified in our march 2007 credit agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the march 2007 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement we believe that as of december 31 2009 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the march 2007 credit agreement 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 7764 million at december 31 2009 compared to 9061 million at december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 we had the ability to borrow an additional 2650 million under our march 2007 credit agreement and 1892 million under other existing lines of credit 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 357 million at december 31 2009 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our projected contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment various take or pay and throughput agreements and obligations under our existing credit agreements based on projected borrowings in thousands 

 

  

    

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions we have determined that the expected 2010 contributions to our domestic nonqualified and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans should approximate 60 million we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount we have made 364 million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december 31 2009 

the liability related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties recorded in “other noncurrent liabilities” totaled 223 million and 813 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in “other assets” totaled 149 million and 399 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions their continued viability is not certain and could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments or to not renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit in recent quarters the capital markets have remained volatile as a result of adverse conditions that caused the consolidation failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies if as a result capital availability remains less prevalent we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would need or desire to do so which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions in addition our cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 

at december 31 2009 we had the ability to borrow in excess of 450 million under our march 2007 credit agreement and other existing lines of credit subject to various financial covenants under our march 2007 credit agreement with generally strong cash generative businesses and no significant debt maturities before 2013 we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position despite the current capital markets situation 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party or prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in cases in which we have been designated as a prp our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 363 million 416 million and 429 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2009 totaled approximately 156 million down 34 million from 190 million at december 31 2008 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 legal proceedings on page 20 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 114 million 214 million and 106 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling korean won chinese yuan and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign exchange contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by these parties we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available a forward contract may be employed to reduce exposure generally expiring within one year while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of 03 million at december 31 2009 we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10 change in select exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2009 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in an increase of 20 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of 17 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2009 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of 4392 million and 5440 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively these borrowings bore average interest rates of 083 and 192 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively a hypothetical 10 change approximately 8 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 04 million as of december 31 2009 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs our current interest rate spreads which were negotiated prior to the global recession will likely not be obtainable in the event that we would need to refinance our credit facilities 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market we purchase natural gas contracts when appropriate for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 

our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with major financial institutions such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are markedtomarket the unrealized gains andor losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2009 and 2008 there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding additionally any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

in 2004 we entered into treasury lock agreements or tlocks with a notional value of 2750 million to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85 of our january 2005 public offering of senior notes the tlocks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 425 the value of the tlocks resulted from the difference between 1 the yieldtomaturity of the 10year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the senior notes issued and 2 the fixed rate of approximately 425 the cumulative loss effect of the tlock agreements was 22 million and is being amortized over the life of the senior notes as an adjustment to the interest expense of the senior notes at december 31 2009 there were losses of approximately 11 million 07 million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss that remain to be expensed

customers 

our polymer additives segment offers more than 70 products to a variety of endmarkets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers lubricant manufacturers refiners and other specialty chemical companies 

sales of polymer additives in asia are expected to grow longterm due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states or us and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the us europe and the middle east in addition we have completed the purchase of 100 ownership in two previous joint venture manufacturing sites in china ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical and industry company limited and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals company limited and began flame retardant production at our nanjing site 

a number of customers of our polymer additives segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical and is currently below historical levels with timing of recovery uncertain 

competition 

our polymer additives segment serves the following markets the us asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the polymer additives marketplace 

competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers and resin systems in endproducts in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries which has caused us to expand our product portfolio to include bromine phosphorus and mineral chemistries that are common in over 80 of end uses today for other additives competition is introduced by lowcost antioxidant suppliers we have begun to offer our basic products from lower cost manufacturing sites 

we are a market leader in the brominated flame retardant business and our most significant competitors are chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd industrial products division or israel chemicals we are also a market leader in the phosphorusbased flame retardant business and in the mineralbased flame retardants business our most significant competitors in the phosphorusbased flame retardant business are israel chemicals jiangsu yoke technology co ltd and zhejiang wansheng chemical co ltd almatis kyowa chemical industry co ltd and nabaltec gmbh are our most significant competitors in the mineralbased flame retardants business we are a market leader in the plastic additives business and our most significant competitors are ciba holding ag chemtura corporation and songwon industrial co ltd 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our polymer additives operations are bromine bisphenola phenol benzene caustic soda phosphorus oxychloride aluminum trihydrate polystyrene isobutylene and phosphorous derivatives most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

the bromine we use in our polymer additives segment comes from two locations arkansas and the dead sea our brine reserves in arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited or jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has virtually inexhaustible reserves 

we entered into a range of phosphorus derivative supply agreements with rhodia sa as part of the acquisition of the rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business

our catalysts segment includes refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product categories 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

refinery catalysts our two main refinery catalysts product lines are hydroprocessing or hpc catalysts and fluidized catalytic cracking or fcc catalysts and additives 

hpc catalysts are primarily used to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products as well as to convert heavy feedstock into lighter more valuable products fcc catalysts assist in the cracking of petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as fuels and petrochemical feedstock our fcc additives are used to remove sulfur in gasoline and to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield and to boost octane in gasoline we offer more than 90 different hpc catalysts products and more than 70 different fcc catalysts and additives products to our customers 

polyolefin catalysts  we manufacture aluminum and magnesiumalkyls which are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates we also produce metallocenesinglesite catalysts which aid in the development and production of new polymers that increase impact strength clarity and melt characteristics of plastic films we are continuing to build on our organometallics base and to expand the portfolio of products and capabilities we offer our customers 

customers 

our catalysts segment customers include multinational corporations such as exxonmobil corporation royal dutch petroleum company and chevron corporation independent petroleum refining companies such as valero energy corporation and tesoro petroleum corporation and national petroleum refining companies such as saudi aramco mobil refinery company ltd petróleo brasileiro sa and petróleos mexicanos 

we estimate that there are currently approximately 450 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 2000 hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to three years 

competition 

our catalysts segment serves the following markets the us latin america asia europe and the middle east each of which is highly competitive product performance and quality price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract research and development product and process improvements specialized customer services the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and the maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace through our research and development we strive to differentiate our business by developing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

in our catalysts segment we are a market leader in the hpc and fcc catalysts markets and our major competitors in the hpc catalysts market are criterion catalysts and technologies and wr grace  coadvanced refining technologies our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market are wr grace  co and basf corporation some of the major catalysts competitors have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction our major competitors in the polyolefin market include akzo nobel nv chemtura corporation tosoh corporation and wr grace  co 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alpha olefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility certain critical raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility despite our mitigating efforts for example molybdenum prices increased more than fourfold in 2004 to an average of 1666lb and increased to 3220lb in 2005 this was followed by a decrease to 2495lb in 2006 then an increase to 3030lb in 2007 in 2008 these prices averaged 2930lb but we saw a significant decline in the fourth quarter to end the year at 985lb our profitability may be affected if we are unable to recover significant raw material costs from our customers 

fine chemicals 

our fine chemicals segment consists of two categories performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

performance chemicals performance chemicals include products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids mercury control paper manufacturing water purification glass manufacturing photography and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides disinfectants

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemical products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs 

our most significant pharmaceutical bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

we will continue to sell methyl bromide in our current markets throughout 2009 as current regulations allow with reduced criticaluse allowances compared to 2008 in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the us western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for “critical uses” where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by the us environmental protection agency or epa the us submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

customers 

the fine chemicals segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling and oil services water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2008 with an occupational injury and illness rate of 048 

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new requirements under the european commission’s proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach reach imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern  such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic or cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic or pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative or vpvb and endocrine disruptors will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product in 2008 one albemarle product was nominated by european regulators as a candidate for authorization hexabromocyclododecane or hbcd 

the reach regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs including the hiring of additional employees to coordinate the additional reporting requirements and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in their demand 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to them and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the us and similar foreign and state laws our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters in accordance with the guidelines of the aicpa statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” and sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” respectively when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated future developments and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 40

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse conditions in the global economy and the volatility and disruption of financial markets could negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products negatively impacting our operating results our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by the global recession including the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges currently affecting the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion further suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if the global recession continues for significant future periods or deteriorates significantly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

volatility and disruption of financial markets could affect access to credit 

the current difficult economic market environment is causing contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace this could potentially reduce our sources of liquidity and our customers’ sources of liquidity 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 

in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example our fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states we and our joint ventures currently have approximately 30 facilities located outside the united states including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling brazilian real korean won and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us if our contractual indemnity is not upheld our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

in the us a number of state legislatures are considering draft legislation which would impose limitations on or prohibit the use of certain brominated flame retardants for specific applications for example in 2007 the state of washington passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses after january 1 2008 and in televisions computers and residential upholstered furniture after january 1 2011 if a safer and technically feasible alternative is discovered the washington state department of ecology published a draft report in november 2008 that concluded that such alternatives exist the state of maine passed a bill that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses mattress pads and textiles used in residential furniture after january 1 2008 and in the casings of televisions and computers after january 1 2010 similar bills are currently under consideration in a number of other states and we expect additional states to consider similar measures in the future 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

additionally agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants including decabromodiphenyl ether hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants 

the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether which was banned for limited applications in the states of washington and maine as described above norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april 2008 except for certain transportation applications on april 1 2008 the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption as a consequence the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july 1 2008 in 2008 approximately 1 of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 

additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on an average interest rate of 35 and outstanding borrowings at february 12 2009 of 9490 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 333 million a hypothetical 10 change approximately 35 basis points in the average interest rate applicable to our total borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 33 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

conditions in the global credit markets have been volatile in recent months continued volatility and more stringent credit standards could impact our ability to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms and could result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition while current conditions in the global credit markets have affected some borrowers’ ability to raise additional capital or to refinance existing obligations to date the volatility in the global credit markets has had limited impact on us we exchanged and extended the maturity of our senior credit agreement in early 2007 before the current volatility manifested as a result currently we do not have any significant obligation maturity before 2013 when our march 2007 credit agreement matures existing availability under existing committed credit facilities are expected to be sufficient for our working capital and capital expenditure needs 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our march 2007 credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our march 2007 credit agreement the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future

could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 38 

notably while we have agreed upon rates and terms under our march 2007 credit agreement there is a risk that our banks might require us to renegotiate certain terms of our credit agreement should we need to raise additional debt for acquisitions or general corporate needs 

a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa2 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding these rating services have maintained our ratings outlook as “stable” however any of the events described above could negatively affect our ratings outlook 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

weatherrelated matters could impact our results of operations 

in 2005 and again in the third quarter of 2008 major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products if similar weatherrelated matters occur in the future it could negatively affect our results of operations at our sites in this region 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fails additionally severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 

as of december 31 2008 we had 4130 employees approximately 20 of our 2230 us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2010 and 2011 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the us the netherlands germany belgium france and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 92 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

during 2008 we made a 250 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately 78 funded on an internal revenue service or irs funding basis as of december 31 2008 while we do not expect significant cash contributions to be required we may choose to make additional voluntary pension contributions in 2009 contributions after 2009 could vary depending on factors such as asset returns thencurrent interest rates and legislative changes the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as an american chemistry council member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 3 2006 we received a notice of violation or nov from the epa region 4 regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg sc the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant we are currently engaged in discussions with the epa seeking to resolve these allegations but no assurances can be given that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both parties any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines penalties capital expenditures or some combination thereof at this time it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of our discussions with the epa or the financial impact which may result therefrom however we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the company 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability and premises liability litigation we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages as estimated by our general counsel we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

 we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forwardlooking statements should circumstances change except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k 

the following is a discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” on page 38 

overview and outlook 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals our products and services enhance the value of our customers’ endproducts by improving performance providing essential product attributes lowering cost and simplifying processing we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers including petroleum refiners utilities providers manufacturers of consumer electronics building and construction materials automotive parts packaging pharmachemicals and agrichemicals we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise flexible lowcost global manufacturing base and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

our plans for growth in our businesses are being impacted by the current poor conditions in the global economy but we believe that our businesses are well positioned to adapt to these changing global market conditions we expect to continue to deliver value to our shareholders through strategically managing our product portfolio for highergrowth and highermargin products and services continued focus on research and development investment in innovative technologies our financial discipline effective cost controls 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

and reductions where appropriate and our ongoing stewardship of our assets and financial position we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative yet commercially viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace on a segmentbysegment basis we expect continued nearterm weakness in our polymer additives segment as softness in demand in the electronics construction and automotive industries continues to pressure this segment’s performance particularly in our flame retardants portfolio industry destocking has driven downstream inventories down steeply while timing is uncertain we expect the tightening in inventory levels may provide improving volumes in our polymer additives segment as endmarket demand recovers we also expect the potential for more stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world may help drive growth in our polymer additives segment growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by longterm global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of clean air initiatives and new opportunities in alternative fuel technologies our fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions 

2008 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 2009 outlook 

polymer additives we expect the recent downturn in consumer electronics together with already lackluster demand in the automotive and construction sectors to impact volumes and profitability of our polymer additives segment through 2009 although we are taking steps to restructure our operations and cut costs we expect 2009 will be challenging until consumer demand returns and global markets rebound in the longer term the increasing standard of living around the globe should drive higher demand for electrical and electronic equipment and new construction this combined with the potential for increasingly stringent firesafety regulations and global climate initiatives should increase the need for insulation materials the timing of the return to growth in the global markets is uncertain 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we are continuing to increase our presence in china as we build a foundation for expanding our business in asia expansion of our now wholly owned antioxidants facility in shanghai is expected to come online in 2009 in addition our flame retardant plant in nanjing should allow us to increase operations as we produce phosphorousbased flame retardants at this site to serve the asiapacific construction and electronic markets 

new product development momentum continues in our polymer additives segment the trend in some electronic components toward halogenfree flame retardants while challenging our legacy products also creates numerous development opportunities with our diverse customer base we plan to begin commercializing sales of a new halogenfree product in one of our keygrowth markets and have several others in various stages of development we also plan to commercialize a new polyurea curative which offers greater cure speed flexibility 

catalysts  we expect revenue growth in our catalysts segment to be driven by global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of clean air initiatives while we continue to closely monitor developments in the global economy we expect our catalysts segment profit growth in 2009 to come primarily from new product introductions new markets that we penetrate fcc pricing improvements and the continued growth in our polyolefin catalysts business 

with continuing global demand for oil and consumer fuel and tightening fuel quality regulations we believe refiners will process more sour crudes which should require additional hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities further driving demand for these catalysts the hpc catalysts expansion at our bayport texas facility is now operational and delivering products this plant has added approximately 10000 metric tons to our capacity and increased our global hpc capacity including capacity at our joint venture nippon ketjen by approximately 30 we believe this will provide us with the capacity to meet the growth in demand that we expect in this business in the coming years we continue to believe we will need additional hpc capacity in the future to meet expected increased demand we must also continue to successfully pass through metals costs and ensure optimal inventory levels in periods of declining metals prices 

our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins to support the value these products bring to the market while we believe there remains room for further margin improvement we believe to be successful we must continue to deliver highperforming superior quality products to meet the growing demands of refiners processing increasingly heavy crudes we have seen incremental margin increases although we continue to face raw material cost pressures related to energy metals imported rare earths and transportation costs we believe however that our price increases should offset increasing raw material and energy costs but there is no guarantee that will occur 

we are focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced highthroughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the alternative fuels business which includes biodiesel canadian oil sands gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil prices increase 

fine chemicals our fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions in our performance chemicals sector in spite of the current economic pressures we expect stable growth in 2009 as we continue to expand the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement our two strategic areas of focus in our fine chemicals segment have been to maximize our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 

we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets as we supply bromine feed stocks to our polymer additives segment our profitability is generally impacted as market conditions change in that sector also we will continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last year allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and maximizing cash generation in addition we will continue to focus on tax efficiency however incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates we believe our global effective tax rate may be in the range of 18 to 19 but will vary based on the locales in which incremental income is actually earned we increased our quarterly dividend payout by 4 in 2009 to 0125 per share under our existing share repurchase program we expect to periodically repurchase shares in 2009 on an opportunistic basis in addition we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

polymer additives 

our polymer additives segment recorded net sales for 2007 of 9045 million down 159 million or 2 versus 2006 net sales declined in our flame retardant portfolio primarily due to reduced volumes in our tetrabrom product line partially offset by higher yearoveryear pricing in certain of our proprietary products and favorable foreign exchange rates net sales improved in stabilizers and curatives product lines due to the effects of improved pricing and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by slightly reduced volumes segment income decreased by 11 to 1307 million due mainly to lower tetrabrom volumes and increased raw material and other costs partially offset by improved pricing and favorable foreign exchange rates for 2007 as compared to 2006 

catalysts 

our catalysts segment recorded net sales for 2007 of 8942 million up 552 million or 7 versus 2006 this increase is a result of pricing improvements in fcc refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts partially offset by reduced volumes in refinery catalysts segment income increased 25 or 311 million to 1546 million due mainly to higher pricing and additional equity earnings in several of our catalysts segment joint ventures partially offset by increased raw material costs and a decrease in equity earnings from our nippon ketjen joint venture in addition our catalysts segment income for 2007 includes a 21 million pretax benefit from the elimination of an employee benefit plan 

fine chemicals 

our fine chemicals segment recorded net sales for 2007 of 5375 million down 716 million or 12 versus 2006 this decrease was due mainly to the disposition of our thann france facility a decline in our custom service products and is partially offset by the acquisition of the south haven michigan facility and improved pricing in our bromine portfolio and fine chemistry services business segment income for 2007 was 869 million up 247 million or 40 from 2006 due mainly to increased pricing improved plant production efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange rates 

corporate and other 

for 2007 our corporate and other expenses decreased 42 million or 8 to 504 million from 2006 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain employee benefit expenses partially offset by an increase in legal and consulting costs 

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates 

estimates assumptions and reclassifications 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of the financial statements 

certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing 1 the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter 2 the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and 3 the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes selling prices raw material prices labor and other employee benefit costs capital additions and other economic or market related factors significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events we use a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing our wacc calculation includes factors such as the riskfree rate of return borrowing costs and expected equity premiums the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and therefore are beyond our control we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 44 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

we follow the guidance of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of certain requirements of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132r” or sfas no 158 sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required under sfas no 158 we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the difference between a plan’s funded status and its balance sheet position prior to adoption of the standard is recognized net of tax as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2008 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to indices such as moody’s aa the international index company and iboxx as well as a yield curve derived from fixedincome security yields the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

country specific aagraded or better corporate bonds without special features or options which could affect the duration in some countries the yield curve may be based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments at december 31 2008 the weightedaverage discount rate was increased for the pension plans from 639 to 645 and for the other postretirement plans from 640 to 655 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2008 measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2008 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on pension plan assets remained at 871 there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 700 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets either our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2008 and 2007 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase changed to 403 from 408 respectively for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation remained at 425 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2008 and 2007 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2008 the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees decreased by 025 for 2009 the assumed trend rate for pre65 coverage is 85 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 50 in the year 2017 the 2009 assumed trend rate for post65 coverage is 12 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 50 in the year 2020 

the effect of a 1 increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit obligation by 01 million and would increase the service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount a 1 decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit obligation by 02 million and would decrease the service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the us in thousands 

 

  

 income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005 all us federal income tax issues for the tax years 2000 through 2004 were resolved as of december 2008 the irs is currently reviewing our income tax returns for the tax years 2005 through 2007 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2002 during 2008 we completed the tax audits for the following tax jurisdictions and respective tax years belgium 2005 through 2006 united kingdom 2003 and the netherlands 2004 through 2005 no significant tax was assessed for these audits the german tax authorities are examining tax years 2002 through 2005 and we anticipate a resolution during 2009 

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits are uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to a number of issues up to approximately 333 million as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and closure of tax statutes 

as of september 30 2006 and continuing in 2007 and 2008 we designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result recorded a tax benefit in 2006 of 16 million due to the reversal of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities we will not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries as a result of this designation our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

stockbased compensation expense 

the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model the fair value of these awards is determined after giving affect to estimated forfeitures such value is recognized as expense over the service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team inhouse to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews coordinate the process for these reviews provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting a steering committee comprised of personnel from finance and alliance services is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox 404 team status and updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retained an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets funding working capital and repayment of debt in 2008 we made a 250 million voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans historically cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by funds from operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our march 2007 credit agreement which is discussed below to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash balance increased by 1227 million to 2533 million at december 31 2008 from 1306 million at december 31 2007 for 2008 our operations provided 3157 million of cash compared to 2425 million in 2007 this increase of 732 million is primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in profitability and income taxes payable and an increase in pension and postretirement contributions cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of 1637 million which consisted principally of acquisitions and capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements remaining cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds from borrowings of 2071 million were used to purchase 1690 million of our common stock and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 423 million 

net current assets increased 901 million to 7406 million at december 31 2008 from 6505 million at december 31 2007 the increase in net current assets was due primarily to an increase in cash inventory and other current assets partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2007 were 1306 million down 189 million from 1495 million at yearend 2006 for 2007 cash flows provided from operating activities of 2425 million together with 1079 million of proceeds from borrowings and 219 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options were used primarily to cover operating activities repay debt of 1335 million fund capital expenditures totaling 987 million purchases of 1012 million of our common stock pay quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling 400 million and acquire additional interests of 179 million in our two antioxidant joint ventures in china ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical and industry company limited and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals company limited 

capital expenditures in 2008 of 997 million were used for plant machinery and equipment improvements and were comparable to 2007 expenditures of 987 million we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 1200 million in 2009 mainly due to increases in plant machinery and equipment in our catalysts and fine chemicals segments however we will be closely monitoring our willingness to fund that budget in light of the global economic situation and our cash generation as the year progresses we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have outstanding 3250 million of 510 senior notes due in 2015 or the senior notes the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 

the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries we believe that as of december 31 2008 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture governing the senior notes 

for additional funding and liquidity purposes we currently maintain a 6750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving senior credit facility which we refer to as the march 2007 credit agreement the march 2007 credit agreement provides for an additional 2000 million in credit if needed upon additional loan commitments by our existing andor additional lenders the total spreads and fees can range from 032 to 0675 over the london interbank offered rate or libor applicable to the currency of denomination of the borrowing and are based upon our credit rating from one of the major credit rating agencies there were aggregate borrowings outstanding under the march 2007 credit agreement of 4950 million at december 31 2008 borrowings under the march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at variable rates which was a weighted average of 307 during the fourth quarter of 2008 

in march 2008 we exercised an option under the march 2007 credit agreement to extend the maturity date from march 2012 to march 2013 lenders representing 874 of the commitments or 5900 million out of 6750 million approved the extension no other changes to the agreement were part of the extension and no fees other than attorney fees were paid as a result of the extension 850 million and 5900 million in commitments now have a maturityexpiration date of march 2012 and march 2013 respectively 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement as of the end of any fiscal quarter b consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement must be greater than or equal to 7500 million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the us and c with the exception of liens specified in our march 2007 credit agreement liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the march 2007 credit agreement would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined in the march 2007 credit agreement we believe that as of december 31 2008 we were and currently are in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the march 2007 credit agreement 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 9061 million at december 31 2008 compared to 7073 million at december 31 2007 in addition at december 31 2008 we had the ability to borrow an additional 1746 million under our march 2007 credit agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 576 million at december 31 2008 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment and various take or pay and throughput agreements in thousands 

 

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

 amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions we have determined that the expected 2009 contributions to our domestic nonqualified and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans should approximate 90 million we may choose to make additional pension contributions above this amount we have made 371 million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december 31 2008 

the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties recorded in “other noncurrent liabilities” totaled 813 million and 1072 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in “other assets” totaled 399 million and 500 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement should be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions their continued viability is not certain and could lead them not to honor their contractual credit commitments or renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit recently the capital markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the consolidation failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies if the capital markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited we may incur increased costs associated with borrowings in addition it is possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like or need to do so which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions while we believe that recent governmental and regulatory actions reduce the risk of a further deterioration or systemic contraction of capital markets there can be no certainty that our liquidity will not be negatively impacted in addition our cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of the current financial economic and capital market conditions and uncertainty 

on december 31 2008 we had approximately 56 of our cash in us treasury or equivalent securities the increased concentration of shortterm investments in us treasury or equivalent securities in part reflects our effort to mitigate the counterparty risk attendant to the aforementioned capital market conditions in addition we have untapped lines of credit in excess of 3190 million available with generally strong cash generative businesses and minimal significant debt maturities before 2013 we believe we have a solid liquidity position given the current financial market situation 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party or prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases our participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 416 million 429 million and 358 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2008 totaled approximately 190 million down 41 million from 231 million at december 31 2007 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 legal proceedings on page 19 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 214 million 106 million and 57 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in the future capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” or sfas no 141r which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date with limited exceptions this replaces the costallocation process in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas no 141r will impact the manner in which we account for future business combinations 

in december 2007 fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” or sfas no 160 which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest it also requires disclosure of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest sfas no 160 establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation it also requires a parent to recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent’s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and the related presentation and disclosure requirements are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented as a result upon adoption we expect to retroactively reclassify the “minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries” balance currently included in the “other noncurrent liabilities” section of the consolidated balance sheet to a new component of equity with respect to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries this adoption will impact the presentation of albemarle’s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position 1572 “partial deferral of the effective date of statement 157” which delayed the effective date of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the adoption of the deferred portion of sfas no 157 on january 1 2009 is not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statements

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling brazilian real korean won and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from timetotime of foreign exchange contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the other parties and no material loss would be expected from their nonperformance we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which generally expire within one year in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net liability position of 02 million at december 31 2008 we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous 10 changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2008 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of 08 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of 09 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2008 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities

we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of 5440 million and 3279 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively these borrowings bore average interest rates of 192 and 535 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively a hypothetical 10 change approximately 19 basis points in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 10 million as of december 31 2008 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

in 2004 we entered into treasury lock agreements or tlocks with a notional value of 2750 million to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85 of our january 2005 public offering of senior notes the tlocks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 425 the value of the tlocks resulted from the difference between 1 the yieldtomaturity of the 10year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the senior notes issued and 2 the fixed rate of approximately 425 the cumulative loss effect of the tlock agreements was 22 million and is being amortized over the life of the senior notes as an adjustment to the interest expense of the senior notes at december 31 2008 there were losses of approximately 13 million 08 million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss that remain to be expensed 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market we purchase natural gas contracts when appropriate for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 

our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with major financial institutions such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are markedtomarket the unrealized gains andor losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2008 and 2007 there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding additionally any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate but do not have a significant impact on results of operations

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern—such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative vpvb and endocrine disruptors—will be subject to an authorization process authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach came into effect in 2007 with the highest priority chemicals to be reviewed in approximately three years the regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs including the hiring of additional employees to coordinate the additional reporting requirements and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in their demand 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to them and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the united states and similar foreign and state laws our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not be material to operations 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters in accordance with the guidelines of the aicpa statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” and sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” respectively when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated future developments and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 40

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 

in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods in addition crop pricing and when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient

catalysts products and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states we and our joint ventures currently have approximately 30 facilities located outside the united states including facilities and offices located in austria australia belgium brazil france germany italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china russia saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro japanese yen and british pound sterling exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us if our contractual indemnity is not upheld our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

regulation or the threat of regulation of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

recently there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products which are used in a variety of applications concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

in the united states a number of state legislatures are considering draft legislation which would impose limitations on or prohibit the use of certain brominated flame retardants for specific applications for example in 2007 the state of washington passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses after january 1 2008 and in televisions computers and residential upholstered furniture after january 1 2011 if a safer and technically feasible alternative is discovered the state of maine passed a bill that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses mattress pads and textiles used in residential furniture after january 1 2008 and in the casings of televisions and computers after january 1 2010 similar bills are currently under consideration in a number of other states and we expect additional states to consider similar measures in the future 

additionally agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants including decabromodiphenyl ether hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants a number of actions are currently pending between the european union and certain of its member states whereby the european union is challenging the respective member state’s rights to impose limitations on or prohibit the use of certain brominated flame retardants 

the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether which was banned for limited applications in the states of washington and maine as described above sweden banned the use of decabromodiphenyl ether for use in nonelectronic applications as of january 1 2007 but the european commission is challenging this action in 2007 less than 2 of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether neither the maine nor the swedish legislation will have an adverse effect on our sales or profitability however additional government regulations including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on an average interest rate of 427 at february 15 2008 and outstanding borrowings at that date of 8855 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 378 million a hypothetical 10 change approximately 40 basis points in the variable interest rates applicable to a portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 18 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

conditions in the global credit markets have been volatile in recent months continued volatility and more stringent credit standards could impact our ability to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms and could result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition while current conditions in the global credit markets have affected some borrowers’ ability to raise additional capital or to refinance existing obligations to date the volatility in the global credit markets has had limited impact on us we exchanged and extended the maturity of our senior credit agreement in early 2007 before the current volatility manifested as a result currently we do not have any significant obligation maturity before 2012 when our march 2007 credit agreement matures existing availability under existing committed credit facilities are expected to be sufficient for our working capital and capital expenditure needs 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our march 2007 credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in our march 2007 credit agreement the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “financial condition and liquidity—longterm debt” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 38 

a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa2 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain

we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 

as of december 31 2007 we had 4130 employees approximately 20 of our 2230 us employees are unionized our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2008 2009 and 2010 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include

 although our pension plans are currently adequately funded events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the united states the netherlands germany belgium france and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 92 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2007 we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately 132 funded on an internal revenue service or irs funding basis as of december 31 2007 and as a result there are no required cash contributions to the plans in 2008 nor do we anticipate making discretionary contributions to the plans during 2008 however the actual amount of contributions could vary depending on factors such as asset returns thencurrent interest rates and legislative changes the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world as an american chemistry council member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 3 2006 we received a notice of violation or nov from the epa regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg sc the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant we are currently engaged in discussions with the epa seeking to resolve these allegations but no assurances can be given that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both parties any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines penalties capital expenditures or some combination thereof at this time it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of our discussions with the epa or the financial impact which may result therefrom however we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the company 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability and premises liability litigation we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages as estimated by our general counsel we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

overview and outlook 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals our products and services enhance the value of our customers’ endproducts by improving performance providing essential product attributes lowering cost and simplifying processing we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers including manufacturers of consumer electronics building and construction materials automotive parts packaging pharmachemicals and agrichemicals and petroleum refiners we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise flexible lowcost global manufacturing base and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to come from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment new construction and increasingly stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of clean air initiatives the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions

2008 outlook 

polymer additives we expect growth of our polymer additives segment to come from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment new construction and increasingly stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world in 2008 we expect modest volume growth while achieving pricing initiatives to offset raw material and energy costs that continue to rise 

we are increasing our presence in china as we build a foundation for expanding our business in asia our technology center in nanjing is now operational this center provides technical support for our polymer additives customers in the asia pacific region in addition the construction of our phosphorous flame retardant plant in nanjing is on schedule for a start up in the first half of 2008 we intend to produce phosphorous flameretardants at this site to serve the rapidly growing asiapacific construction and electronic markets 

new product development momentum continues in polymer additives the trend in some electronic components toward halogen free flame retardants is creating numerous development opportunities with our diverse customer base we are beginning to commercialize a new patent protected environmentally friendly form of one of our proprietary products we also recently introduced to the market a new technical innovation in our mineral flame retardant business 

catalysts  we expect revenue growth in our catalysts segment to be driven by global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of clean air initiatives we expect catalysts profit growth in 2008 will come primarily from new product introductions new markets that we penetrate fcc pricing improvements and the continued growth in our polyolefin catalysts business 

as oil demand remains elevated we believe refiners will process more sour crudes which will require additional hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities further driving demand for these catalysts the hpc catalysts expansion at our bayport texas facility is now operational delivering products this plant will add approximately 10000 metric tons to our capacity more than double the capacity at our bayport site and increase our global hpc capacity including capacity at our joint venture nippon ketjen by approximately 30 we believe this will provide us with the capacity to meet the strong growth in demand for 2008 and 2009 that we expect in this business we continue to believe we will need additional hpc capacity in 2009 and thereafter due to expected increased demand 

our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins to support the value these products bring to the market while we believe there remains room for further margin improvement we believe to be successful we must continue to deliver highperforming superior quality products to meet the growing demands of refiners processing increasingly heavy crudes in addition we expect to continue to see incremental margin benefits in future quarters due to the fcc price increases that were announced in 2007 our fcc business continues to be faced with high raw material costs increases related to energy metals imported rare earths and transportation costs we believe however that our price increases will offset increasing raw material and energy costs but there is no guarantee that will occur 

we are focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced highthroughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the alternative fuels business which includes biodiesel canadian oil sands gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil remains at historically high levels 

fine chemicals the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions we expect stable growth throughout 2008 in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement our two strategic areas of focus in fine chemicals have been to maximize our bromine franchise value and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 

we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets in addition we will continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last three years allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and repaying debt in 2008 in addition we will continue to focus on tax efficiency however incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates we believe our global effective tax rate may be in the range of 235 to 245 but will vary based on the locales in which incremental income is actually earned we have increased our quarterly dividend payout in 2008 to 012 per share under our existing share repurchase program we expect to accelerate the amount of shares repurchased in 2008 as compared to 2007 in february 2008 we repurchased 4000000 shares of our common stock in addition we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

results of operations 

the following data and discussion provides an analysis of certain significant factors affecting our results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income 

selected financial data 

 

  

 comparison of 2007 to 2006 

net sales 

for 2007 we recorded net sales of 23362 million a decrease of 323 million or 1 compared to net sales of 23685 for 2006 this decrease was due primarily to reduced volumes in all segments and the disposition of our thann france facility partially offset by improved pricingmix in all segments overall volumes declined 10 pricemix increased 7 and foreign currency increased 2 compared to 2006 

polymer additives’ net sales for 2007 decreased 159 million or 2 compared to 2006 primarily due to an 11 decline in volume partially offset by an improvement in pricemix of 7 and an increase of 2 related to foreign currency catalysts’ net sales increased 552 million or 7 due mainly to an 8 improvement in pricemix and an increase of 3 related to foreign currency 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

partially offset by a 4 decline in volume fine chemicals’ net sales decreased 716 million or 12 primarily due to the disposition of our thann france facility in addition to reduced volumes of 8 partially offset by improved pricemix of 4 and an increase of 2 in foreign currency for a detailed discussion of revenues and segment income before taxes for each segment see “segment information overview” below 

gross profit 

for 2007 our gross profit increased 717 million or 13 from 2006 to 6225 million due to improved pricing partially offset by reduced volumes and increased manufacturing and raw material costs our gross profit margin for 2007 increased to 266 from 233 in 2006 due partially to the disposition of our thann france facility which had historically low profit margins 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for 2007 our selling general and administrative or sga expenses increased 72 million or 3 from 2006 this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other employee benefit expenses of 42 million and outside legal and consulting services of 27 million as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 105 in 2007 versus 100 in 2006 

research and development expenses 

for 2007 our research and development or rd expenses increased 164 million or 35 from 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher investments in new catalysts to satisfy the needs in both traditional and alternative fuels markets and in new polymer additives and fine chemicals products as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 27 in 2007 versus 20 in 2006 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for 2007 decreased 57 million or 13 from 2006 to 383 million due to lower average outstanding debt levels as well as an increased amount of capitalized interest in 2007 as a result of our bayport texas plant expansion 

other income expenses net 

other income expenses net for 2007 increased 63 million from 2006 to 62 million primarily due to a 30 million foreign exchange adjustment on foreign denominated debt of jbc which occurred in 2006 and an increase in interest income of 16 million 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate fluctuates based on among other factors where income is earned the level of income relative to available tax credits and tax planning opportunities available to us for 2007 our effective income tax rate was 198 compared to 16 for 2006 the effective tax rate in 2007 reflects a 21 million benefit from an enacted tax rate reduction in germany as well as adjustments totaling 84 million identified in the completion of various income tax filings we believe the adjustments did not have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 in 2007 we recorded a valuation allowance of 94 million including 89 million relating to a capital loss carryforward that will more likely than not expire unused the 2006 period was impacted by the reduction in pretax income caused by the thann divestiture charge of 892 million and the associated tax benefit of 308 million or 345 on that charge excluding the thann charge and related tax impact the effective tax rate for 2006 was 148 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

the significant differences between the us federal statutory income tax rate on pretax income and the effective income tax rate for 2007 and 2006 respectively are as follows 

 

  

  minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests’ share of net income was 176 million in 2007 compared to 132 million in 2006 this increase of 44 million is due primarily to increased earnings of jbc primarily due to improved pricing and margins in addition the expense in 2006 includes a benefit for the minority interest portion of the foreign exchange adjustment on foreign denominated debt of jbc see other income expenses net above 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was 246 million for 2007 compared to 250 million in 2006 this decrease of 04 million is due primarily to lower equity earnings from our catalysts segment joint venture nippon ketjen as a result of decreased volumes this decrease is partially offset by additional equity earnings in our other catalysts segment joint ventures 

net income 

our net income increased 61 to 2297 million in 2007 from 1430 million in 2006 primarily due to improved margins and the fine chemicals segment thann divestiture charge of 892 million 584 million after income taxes in 2006 

segment information overview we have identified three reportable segments as required by sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” our polymer additives segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas our catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas our fine chemicals segment is comprised of the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas segment income represents operating profit adjusted for significant nonrecurring items and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments and is reduced by minority interests in income of our consolidated subsidiaries stannica llc jbc ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical and industry company limited and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals company limited segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and allocations for certain corporate costs

polymer additives 

the polymer additives segment recorded net sales for 2007 of 9045 million down 159 million or 2 versus 2006 net sales declined in our flame retardant portfolio primarily due to reduced volumes in our tetrabrom product line partially offset by higher year over year pricing in certain of our proprietary products and favorable foreign exchange rates net sales improved in stabilizers and curatives due to the effects of improved pricing and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by slightly reduced volumes segment income decreased by 11 to 1307 million due mainly to lower tetrabrom volumes and increased raw material and other costs partially offset by improved pricing and favorable foreign exchange rates for 2007 as compared to 2006 

catalysts 

our catalysts segment recorded net sales for 2007 of 8942 million up 552 million or 7 versus 2006 this increase is a result of pricing improvements in fcc refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts partially offset by reduced volumes in refinery catalysts segment income increased 25 or 311 million to 1546 million due mainly to higher pricing and additional equity earnings in several of our catalysts segment joint ventures partially offset by increased raw material costs and a decrease in equity earnings from our nippon ketjen joint venture in addition catalysts segment income for 2007 includes a 21 million pretax benefit from the elimination of an employee benefit plan 

fine chemicals 

fine chemicals segment net sales for 2007 were 5375 million down 716 million or 12 versus 2006 this decrease was due mainly to the disposition of our thann france facility a decline in our custom service products and is partially offset by the acquisition of the south haven michigan facility and improved pricing in our bromine portfolio and fine chemistry services business segment income for 2007 was 869 million up 247 million or 40 from 2006 due mainly to increased pricing improved plant production efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange rates 

corporate and other 

for 2007 our corporate and other expenses decreased 42 million or 8 to 504 million from 2006 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain employee benefit expenses partially offset by an increase in legal and consulting costs 

comparison of 2006 to 2005 

net sales 

for 2006 we recorded net sales of 23685 million an increase of 2610 million or 12 compared to net sales of 21075 for 2005 this increase was mainly due to improved pricing and increased volume in our polymer additives and catalysts segments improved pricing in our fine chemicals segment and the addition of our south haven michigan facility partially offset by the effects of the divestiture of our thann facility overall prices increased 10 and volumes grew 4 compared to 2005 

polymer additives’ net sales were 9204 million up 1226 million or 15 for 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 as prices rose 11 and volume grew 6 catalysts’ net sales were 8390 million up 1014 million or 14 due mainly to a 9 increase in prices and a 7 increase in volume fine chemicals’ net sales increased to 6091 million up 370 million or 6 primarily due to improved pricing of 10 however this increase was partially offset by reduced volumes of 2 for a detailed discussion of revenues and segment income before taxes for each segment see “segment information overview” below 

gross profit 

for 2006 our gross profit increased 1274 million to 5508 million or 30 from 2005 due to increased volume and improved pricing these increases were partially offset by increased raw material and manufacturing in addition our catalysts segment had higher manufacturing costs associated with a planned shutdown at our pasadena texas polyolefin catalysts plant our gross profit margin for 2006 increased to 233 from 201 in 2005 

selling general and administrative expenses 

for 2006 our sga expenses increased 181 million or 8 from 2005 this increase was primarily due to higher sga costs from increased consulting fees related to the implementation of a belgianbased european trading company of 25 million and increased wages and incentive compensation of 113 million as a percentage of net sales sga expenses were 100 in 2006 versus 104 in 2005

research and development expenses 

for 2006 our rd expenses increased 46 million or 11 from 2005 as a percentage of net sales rd expenses were 20 in each of 2006 and 2005 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for 2006 amounted to 440 million an increase of 20 million from 420 million in 2005 this increase was primarily due to the consolidation of jbc effective august 1 2005 and the impact of an additional 25 million on our interest and financing expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 resulting from the inclusion of the debt of jbc the higher interest and financing expenses were also impacted by higher rates on our average outstanding debt in 2006 interest and financing expenses for 2005 included the writeoff of 14 million of deferred financing expenses associated with a 450 million 364day bridge loan that we retired in january 2005 

other income expenses net 

for 2006 our other income expenses net was nominal but decreased 16 million from 2005 this decrease was primarily due to a foreign exchange adjustment of approximately 30 million on foreign denominated debt at jbc partially offset by an increase in interest income of 15 million 

income taxes 

our income taxes for 2006 were 22 million a decrease of 254 million or 92 from 2005 income taxes for 2006 benefited 222 million from earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the us statutory rate due to designating the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries as permanently reinvested as of september 30 2006 92 million from the impact of tax rate changes principally the netherlands and various states on our deferred tax liabilities and 88 million from foreign tax credits related to repatriation of high taxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries 

income taxes for 2005 benefited 56 million from the repatriation of overseas earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 known as the homeland investment act and 67 million from foreign tax credits related to repatriation of high taxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2005 we determined that certain of our reported income tax accounts were overstated based on our detailed reviews accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit of 76 million associated with the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to income tax rate changes in the netherlands in addition the deferred income tax account as recorded under accounting principles board or apb opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes—special areas” reflects an additional expense of 52 million related to the proper recording and identification of earnings and profits or ep adjustments in connection with acquired companies the net impact of these two adjustments amounting to an income tax benefit of 24 million did not have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 or any prior periods presented 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 16 versus 224 in 2005 excluding the thann charge and related tax impact the effective tax rate for 2006 was 148 the decrease from 2005 is due primarily to management’s decision to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries tax rate changes and the benefits from foreign tax credits associated with high taxed earnings from foreign operations the significant differences between the us federal statutory income tax rate on pretax income and the effective income tax rate for 2006 and 2005 respectively are as follows 

 

  

  minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests’ share of net income was 132 million in 2006 compared to 74 million in 2005 our minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries included minority ownership charges of 74 million for jbc for 2006 compared to 20 million for 2005 as jbc was an unconsolidated investment until august 2005 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments decreased 15 million to 250 million in 2006 from 265 million in 2005 due to the consolidation of jbc for the full year of 2006 partially offset by an increase in the equity income of our catalysts’ segment joint ventures of 53 million which had strong sales and improved pricing equity income of 76 million for our portion of jbc’s earnings was included in 2005 prior to august 1 at which time we began accounting for jbc as a consolidated subsidiary 

net income 

our net income increased 24 to 1430 million in 2006 from 1149 million in 2005 primarily due to increased sales improved margins and reduced taxes partially offset by the thann divestiture charge of 892 million 584 million after income taxes

polymer additives 

the polymer additives segment recorded net sales for 2006 of 9204 million up 1226 million or 15 versus 2005 our brominated mineral and phosphorous flame retardant portfolios experienced 6 volume increases and 12 pricing improvements net sales improved in stabilizers and curatives as volumes increased 6 and prices improved 5 excluding a 2005 special item gain of 18 million segment income increased 60 or 555 million to 1474 million due mainly to improved pricing and increased volume partially offset by increased manufacturing costs for 2006 as compared to 2005 

catalysts 

our catalysts segment had net sales for 2006 of 8390 million up 1014 million or 14 versus 2005 due mainly to a 12 pricing improvement and increased volume of 14 in refinery catalysts and 4 pricing improvement and increased volume of 12 in polyolefin catalysts pricing of hpc catalysts reflects certain metal costs which are largely passed through to our end customers these pass through charges have declined as metal prices have moderated resulting in revenue reductions in 2006 versus 2005 product margins however have increased excluding 2005 special item curtailment gains of 38 million related to benefit plan changes segment income increased 34 or 314 million to 1235 million due mainly to higher pricing and increased volume offset by increased raw material cost and higher manufacturing costs associated with a planned shutdown at our pasadena texas polyolefin catalysts plant for 2006 as compared to 2005 in addition equity income of our catalysts joint ventures increased 53 million compared to the same period last year due to strong sales and improved pricing 

fine chemicals 

fine chemicals segment net sales for 2006 were 6091 million up 370 million or 6 versus 2005 this increase was due mainly to pricing improvements of 13 across the bromine portfolio and higher prices and increased volume of 5 and 7 respectively in our fine chemistry services and the addition of the south haven michigan facility partially offsetting the revenue increase were volume reductions of 6 in our bromine portfolio and the divestiture of our thann facility excluding the thann divestiture charge of 892 million in 2006 and a special item charge of 14 million in 2005 fine chemicals segment income increased to 622 million up 163 million or 36 for 2006 from 2005 due to improved pricing partially offset by increased manufacturing and raw material costs 

corporate and other 

for 2006 our corporate and other expenses increased 58 million or 12 to 546 million from 2005 excluding a 2005 special item charge of 23 million this increase was primarily due to higher sga costs for consulting fees related to the implementation of a belgianbased european trading company and increased wages and incentive compensation partially offset by the minority interest portion of the foreign exchange adjustment on foreign currency denominated debt at jbc

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing 1 the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter 2 the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and 3 the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving cash flows consistent with the objective of measuring fair value based on reasonable and supportive assumptions we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” see note 10 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 43 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

we follow the guidance of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of certain requirements of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132 r” or sfas no 158 sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required under sfas no 158 we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the difference between a plan’s funded status and its balance sheet position prior to adoption of the standard is recognized net of tax as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets sfas no 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 and is to be applied prospectively amounts provided for years prior to 2006 contain delayed recognition differences between actual results and expected or estimated results based on the prior guiding principle of the standards the delayed recognition of actual results allowed for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 

during 2007 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions

in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to fixedincome security yields including high quality bonds moody’s aa and the international index company or iboxx aa corporate bond rates along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans the yield curve was produced for a universe containing usissued aagraded corporate bonds without special features or options which could affect the duration for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments at december 31 2007 the weightedaverage discount rate was increased for the pension plans from 578 to 639 and for the other postretirement plans from 581 to 640 to reflect market conditions as of the december 31 2007 measurement date 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2007 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on pension plan assets increased from 806 to 871 this increase resulted from the exclusion of our netherlands pension plan in the 2007 rate of return calculation as the netherlands defined benefit plan changed to a defined contribution plan in 2006 there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 700 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2007 and 2006 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 408 and 362 respectively for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 425 and 370 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2007 the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was increased by 025 for 2008 the assumed trend rate for pre65 coverage is 8 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 525 in the year 2011 the 2008 assumed trend rate for post65 coverage is 9 per year decreasing to an ultimate rate of 525 in the year 2012 

the effect of a 1 increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit obligation by 12 million and would increase the service and interest benefit cost components by 02 million a 1 decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit obligation by 09 million and would decrease the service and interest benefit cost components by 02 million 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the united states in thousands

income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses capital losses and certain tax credit carryforwards a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 

we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position once the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 likely to be realized interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2000 the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year 2004 in 2006 we received tax assessments from the irs for the years 2000 through 2002 we have taken the issues contested to the appeals process and anticipate a resolution in either 2008 or 2009 during 2007 we received tax assessments from the irs for the years 2003 through 2004 we have taken the issues contested to the appeals process and anticipate a resolution in either 2008 or 2009 

with respect to jurisdictions outside the us we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2002 the company received examination notifications from four jurisdictions united kingdom tax authorities are examining tax year 2003 the german tax authorities are examining tax years 2002 through 2005 dutch tax authorities are examining tax years 2004 and 2005 belgian tax authorities are scheduled to begin their examination of tax years 2005 and 2006 in the first quarter of 2008

while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position accordingly additional provisions on federal and foreign taxrelated matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

since the timing of resolutions andor closure of tax audits is uncertain it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that may occur within the next twelve months our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to a number of issues ranging from approximately 97 million to 372 million as a result of settlements with taxing authorities closure of tax statutes andor resolution of issues at appeals 

as of september 30 2006 we designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result recorded a tax benefit of 16 million due to the reversal of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities we will not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries as a result of this designation our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 

as further discussed in note 18 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 43 we asserted that we are permanently reinvested with respect to earnings derived from our investment in jbc for all periods beginning after september 30 2005 

stockbased compensation expense 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” or sfas no 123r prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stockbased awards under the intrinsic value method which followed the recognition and measurement principles of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock awards at fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and for stock options to the extent exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant compensation expense for performance unit awards was recognized based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the end of each quarterly reporting period until distribution to the extent restricted stock awards and performance unit awards were forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the modified prospective method does not require financial amounts for the prior periods presented in this form 10k to be restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing sharebased compensation the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” or sfas no 123 as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure” such value is recognized as expense over the service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses

the application of sfas no 123r had the following effect on december 31 2006 reported amounts relative to amounts that would have been reported using the intrinsic value method under previous accounting in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 the impact of sfas no 123r resulted in additional compensation expense related to stock options not fully vested as of january 1 2006 11 million this was more than offset by the benefit of not recording additional compensation expense during 2006 for outstanding performance unit awards which otherwise would have been required under previous accounting standards under those standards performance units were required to be recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period in accordance with sfas no 123r performance units are now based on a grant date fair value consequently our stockbased compensation expense associated with outstanding performance unit awards was favorably impacted by 132 million during 2006 as the fair value at grant date was lower than the fair value at the end of the reporting period or december 31 2006 

the following table illustrates the effects on net income and earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2005 as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 to stockbased employee awards in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in item 8 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team inhouse to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews coordinate the process for these reviews provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting a steering committee comprised of personnel from finance and alliance services is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox 404 team status updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it is an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us even stronger

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets funding working capital and repayment of debt cash to fund the needs of our business has been provided primarily by operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we expect business activity levels to continue to increase in 2008 the increase in business activity may cause our working capital needs to increase we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we expect our current cash balances and our availability under our march 2007 credit agreement which is discussed below to be sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash balance decreased by 189 million to 1306 million at december 31 2007 from 1495 million at december 31 2006 for 2007 our operations provided 2425 million of cash compared to 3763 million in 2006 this decrease of 1338 million is primarily due to an increase in inventory partially offset by collections of value added tax or vat receivables in our european trading company cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of 1329 million which consisted principally of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements and acquisition of additional interests in our two antioxidant joint ventures in china ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical and industry company limited and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals company limited remaining cash provided from operating activities together with proceeds from borrowings of 1079 million and the proceeds from stock option exercises of 219 million funded longterm debt repayments of 1335 million purchases of our common stock of 1012 million and quarterly dividends to shareholders of 400 million 

net current assets increased 1726 million to 6505 million at december 31 2007 from 4779 million at december 31 2006 the increase in net current assets was due primarily to an increase in inventory and trade accounts receivable a decrease in income taxes payable and current portion of longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in cash 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2006 were 1495 million up 909 million from 586 million at yearend 2005 for 2006 cash flows provided from operating activities of 3763 million together with 1343 million of proceeds from borrowings and 214 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options were used to cover operating activities repay debt of 2393 million fund capital expenditures totaling 998 million purchases of our common stock of 318 million pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of 316 million acquire the assets and fine chemistry services and pharmaceuticals business associated with the south haven michigan facility of dsm pharmaceutical products of 260 million fund investments amounting to 46 million pay dividends to minority interests of 68 million and increase cash and cash equivalents by 909 million 

capital expenditures in 2007 of 987 million were used to expand capacities at existing facilities and were comparable to 2006 expenditures of 998 million we expect our capital expenditures to be at comparable levels in 2008 we anticipate that future capital spending will be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we maintained a senior credit agreement with several banks and other financial institutions that consisted of a 3000 million revolving credit facility and a 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility in march 2007 we exchanged our prior senior credit agreement for a new fiveyear revolving unsecured senior credit facility which we refer to as the march 2007 credit agreement to improve operating flexibility and to take advantage of favorable market conditions the march 2007 credit agreement i exchanged both the 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility 3167 million outstanding at december 31 2006 and the 3000 million revolving credit facility for a 6750 million unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility ii provides for an additional 2000 million in credit if needed upon additional loan commitments by our existing andor additional lenders iii provides for the ability to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility under certain conditions at each anniversary of the closing date iv replaced the consolidated fixed charge coverage covenant and debt to capitalization ratio covenant with a maximum leverage ratio covenant and v reduced the interest rate spread and commitment fees applicable to the company’s borrowings under the credit facility the total spreads and fees can range from 032 to 0675 over the london interbank offered rate or libor applicable to the currency of denomination of the borrowing based upon our credit rating applicable from time to time from one of the major credit rating agencies the march 2007 credit agreement extends the maturity of the credit facility to march 2012 from july 2009 fees and expenses of 10 million were paid related to this new agreement there were aggregate borrowings outstanding under the march 2007 credit agreement of 2650 million at december 31 2007 borrowings under the march 2007 credit agreement bear interest at variable rates which was a weighted average of 535 at december 31 2007 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt as defined must be less than or equal to 350 times consolidated ebitda as defined as of the end of any fiscal quarter b consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined must be greater than or equal to 7500 million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states and c with the exception of liens specified in our march 2007 credit agreement liens may not attach to assets where the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility at our subsidiaries would exceed 20 of consolidated net worth as defined we believe that as of december 31 2007 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

in 2007 we repaid a majority of our variablerate foreign bank loans with excess operating cash and also redeemed the 110 million taxexempt variable interest industrial revenue bonds a nominal fee was paid related to the bond redemption 

we currently have 3250 million of 510 senior notes that are due in 2015 these notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 

the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries we believe that as of december 31 2007 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our senior notes covenants 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 7073 million at december 31 2007 compared to 6819 million at december 31 2006 in addition at december 31 2007 we had the ability to borrow an additional 4044 million under our march 2007 credit agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately 590 million at december 31 2007 none of these offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment and various take or pay and throughput agreements in thousands 

 

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

 

  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” on january 1 2007 the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties recorded in “other noncurrent liabilities” totaled 873 million and 1072 million at january 1 2007 and december 31 2007 respectively related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in “other assets” totaled 390 million and 500 million at january 1 2007 and december 31 2007 respectively we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 

liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our march 2007 credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future for flexibility we maintain a shelf registration statement that permits us to issue from time to time a range of securities including common stock preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt of up to 2200 million in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets which may require additional liquidity 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party or prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases our participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were 367 million 358 million and 306 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2007 totaled approximately 231 million down 65 million from 296 million at december 31 2006 

we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 legal proceedings on page 18 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 106 million 57 million and 95 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively for each of the next few years capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and working towards sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” or sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 in february 2008 the fasb decided to partially defer the implementation of sfas no 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for one year and to remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas no 157 the adoption of sfas no 157 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” or sfas no 159 sfas no 159 permits us to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value or the fair value option election of the fair value option is made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis and is irrevocable at the adoption date unrealized gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings if we were to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities we would report unrealized gains and losses due to changes in their fair value in earnings at each subsequent reporting date sfas no 159 is effective as of january 1 2008 however we are not electing to adopt sfas no 159 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” or sfas no 141r sfas no 141r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date with limited exceptions this replaces the costallocation process in accordance sfas no 141 “business combinations” which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas no 141r will impact the manner in which we account for future business combinations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” or sfas no 160 sfas no 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest it also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest sfas no 160 establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation it also requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent’s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and the related presentation and disclosure requirements are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented we have not yet determined what impact the adoption of sfas no 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb ratified the consensuses of emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 071 “accounting for collaborative arrangements” or eitf 071 the objective of eitf 071 is to define collaborative arrangements and to establish reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties eitf 071 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we have not yet determined what impact the adoption of eitf 071 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from timetotime of foreign exchange contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the other parties and no material loss would be expected from their nonperformance we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

 

 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which generally expire within one year in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of 005 million at december 31 2007 at december 31 2006 no such contracts were outstanding we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous 10 changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2007 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of 05 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of 06 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2007 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of 3279 million and 3330 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively these borrowings bore average interest rates of 535 and 554 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively a hypothetical 10 change approximately 50 basis points in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 18 million as of december 31 2007 we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

in 2004 we entered into treasury lock agreements or tlocks with a notional value of 2750 million to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85 of our january 2005 public offering of senior notes the tlocks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 425 the value of the tlocks resulted from the difference between 1 the yieldtomaturity of the 10year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and 2 the fixed rate of approximately 425 the cumulative loss effect of the tlock agreements was 22 million and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense at december 31 2007 there were losses of approximately 15 million 10 million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss that remain to be expensed 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market we purchase natural gas contracts when appropriate for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 

our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market the unrealized gains andor losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2007 and 2006 there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding additionally any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate but do not have a significant impact on results of operations

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

customers 

the polymer additives segment offers more than 70 products to a variety of endmarkets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers lubricant manufacturers refiners and other specialty chemical companies 

sales of polymer additives are growing rapidly in asia due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the united states europe and the middle east in addition we have joint venture manufacturing sites in china 

a number of customers of our polymer additives segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical 

competition 

the markets served by our polymer additives segment are highly competitive we invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services in order to compete effectively in the polymer additives marketplace 

competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers in endproducts in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries which has caused us to expand our product portfolio to include bromine phosphorus and mineral chemistries that are common in over 80 of end uses today for other additives competition is introduced by lowcost antioxidant suppliers we have begun to offer our basic products from lower cost sources and have pursued new blending technology to produce better more easily processed forms of antioxidant blends 

our most significant competitors in the brominated flame retardant business are chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd industrial products division or israel chemicals our most significant competitor in the phosphorusbased flame retardant business is supresta llc our competitors in the mineralbased flame retardants business are almatis kyowa hakko kogyo co ltd and nabaltec gmbh our most significant competitors in the plastic additives business are ciba specialty chemicals and akzo nobel 

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

the major raw materials we use in our polymer additives operations are bromine bisphenola phenol caustic soda phosphorus oxychloride aluminum trihydrate polystyrene isobutylene and phosphorous derivatives most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

the bromine we use in our polymer additives segment comes from our brine reserves in arkansas which are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited or jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has inexhaustible reserves 

our subsidiary martinswerk gmbh has certain contracts that require it to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate from its suppliers our annual requirements for aluminum trihydrate currently exceed these minimum purchase requirements we also entered into a range of phosphorus derivative supply agreements with rhodia sa as part of the acquisition of the rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business 

catalysts 

our catalysts segment includes refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product categories 

refinery catalysts our two main catalysts product lines are hydroprocessing or hpc catalysts and fluidized catalytic cracking or fcc catalysts and additives 

hpc catalysts are primarily used to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products as well as to convert heavy feedstock into lighter more valuable products fcc catalysts assist in the cracking of petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as fuels and petrochemical feedstock our fcc additives can be used to remove sulfur in gasoline 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

and to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units to increase lpg olefins yield and to boost octane in gasoline we offer more than 90 different hpc catalysts products and more than 70 different fcc catalysts and additives products to our customers 

polyolefin catalysts  we manufacture aluminum and magnesiumalkyls which are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins such as polypropylene and polyethylene used in plastic products elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates we also produce metallocenesinglesite catalysts which aid in the development and production of new polymers that increase impact strength clarity and melt characteristics of plastic films we are continuing to build on our organometallics base and to expand the portfolio of products and capabilities we offer our customers 

customers 

our catalysts segment customers include multinational corporations such as exxonmobil corporation royal dutch petroleum company and chevrontexaco corporation independent petroleum refining companies such as valero energy corporation and tesoro petroleum corporation and national petroleum refining companies such as saudi aramco mobil refinery company ltd petróleo brasileiro sa and petróleos mexicanos 

we estimate that there are currently approximately 450 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 2000 hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to three years we believe that our existing relationships with global petroleum refiners developed by our other business segments present opportunities to grow the market share of our new refinery catalysts business 

competition 

in the catalysts segment hpc and fcc catalysts competition is primarily from major catalysts companies our major competitors in the hpc catalysts market are criterion catalysts and technologies and wr grace  coadvanced refining technologies and our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market are wr grace  co and basf some of the major catalysts companies have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction our major competitors in the polyolefin market include akzo nobel nv axens nv basell service company bv chemtura corporation tosoh corporation univation technologies llc and wr grace  co 

we seek to enhance our competitive position by developing product and process improvements and specialized customer services through our research and development we strive to develop valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alpha olefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility certain critical raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility for example molybdenum prices increased more than fourfold in 2004 and remained at over 600 of the 10year average in 2005 and 2006 our profitability may be reduced if we are unable to pass along such price increases to our customers 

fine chemicals 

our fine chemicals segment consists of two product categories performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

performance chemicals performance chemicals include products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids paper manufacturing water purification glass manufacturing photography and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides disinfectants and sanitizers potassium and chlorinebased products used in industrial applications alkenyl succinic anhydride used in papersizing formulations and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications we sell these products to customers throughout the world for use in personal care products automotive insulation foundry bricks and other industrial products 

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemical products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services or fcs business offers custom 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs 

our most significant bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemicals potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

current regulations allow us to continue to sell methyl bromide into our current markets through 2007 with a reduction allowance for critical uses from our 2006 allowance amount in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the united states western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for critical uses where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by us environmental protection agency or the epa the united states submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

customers 

the fine chemicals segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies 

pricing for many of our fine chemicals is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

competition 

competition in the fine chemicals segment is intense and varies within each of our different product groups in the brominebased products groups we primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers chemtura corporation and israel chemicals as well as certain minor regional producers in pharmaceutical bulk actives ie ibuprofen and propofol we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation astrazeneca plc clariant ltd and cilag ag however there is increasing competition from asian sources we are seeking to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

raw materials 

the major raw materials we use in our fine chemicals operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alpha olefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

the bromine that we use in our fine chemicals segment comes from two primary sources arkansas and jordan the arkansas brine reserves are supported by an active brine rights leasing program where we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in addition through our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has inexhaustible reserves 

sales marketing and distribution 

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service we also use more than 50 selected distributors commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

research and development 

we believe that in order to generate revenue growth maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and processes based on proprietary technologies 

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer additives is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants and improving existing flame retardants to meet higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and value added plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

catalysts research is focused on the needs of both our refinery catalysts customers and our polyolefin catalysts customers refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the polyolefin area we are focused primarily on developing catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems to polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers 

the primary focus of our fine chemicals research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of biocides for industrial and recreational water treatment and other applications especially products based on bromine chemistry 

we spent 463 million 417 million and 313 million in accordance with financial accounting standards board or fasb statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 2 “accounting for research and development costs” in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively on research and development total research and development department spending was 580 million 530 million and 399 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trademarks is an important component of our business as of december 31 2006 we owned approximately 1600 active us and foreign patents and had over 1200 pending us and foreign patent applications in addition in connection with our july 2004 acquisition of the akzo nobel refinery catalysts business we obtained 50 interests in three joint ventures each of which has its own intellectual property portfolio in addition we have acquired rights under the patents and inventions of others through licenses and license our patents and inventions to third parties 

regulation 

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act or osha we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2006 with a low ohsa recordable injury rateillness rate of 057 over the past three years our osha recordable injury incidence rate has been in the top 10 of all mid and large size chemical companies who are members of the american chemistry council or the acc 

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new requirements under the european commission’s proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach reach will impose obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern—such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative vpvb and endocrine disruptors—will be subject to an authorization process per application authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product reach will come into effect in mid2007 with the highest priority chemicals to be reviewed in approximately three years the regulations will impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will likely require us to incur significant additional compliance costs including the hiring of additional employees to coordinate the additional reporting requirements and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand additionally customers may seek products that are not regulated by reach which could also result in a decrease in their demand 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to them and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the united states and similar foreign and state laws our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not be material to operations 

we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters in accordance with the guidelines of the aicpa statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” and sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” respectively when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated future developments and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 38 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

over the last three years we have devoted a significant amount of resources to acquisitions including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses and to joint ventures these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries the following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years 

on september 30 2006 we acquired the assets and fine chemistry services and pharmaceuticals business associated with the south haven michigan facility of dsm pharmaceutical products dsm a business group of royal dsm nv for approximately 260 million subject to final postclosing adjustments 

on july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of the akzo nobel refinery catalysts business for approximately 763 million including expenses at applicable exchange rates during 2004 and 2005 we increased the purchase price by approximately 230 million and 80 million respectively due primarily to payments to akzo nobel as part of the postclosing working capital adjustments during 2005 refinements were made in the determination of the final purchase price allocation versus the estimated allocation at december 31 2004 however none of the changes made to the december 31 2004 allocation were material to our financial position or results of operations as part of the acquisition we acquired 50 ownership of nonconsolidated joint ventures in brazil fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa japan nippon ketjen co ltd and france eurecat sa with affiliates in the united states saudi arabia and italy

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 

in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter in addition the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods 

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states we and our joint ventures currently have approximately 30 facilities located outside the united states including facilities and offices located in austria belgium brazil france germany italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china saudi arabia and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

 in addition certain of our joint ventures operate in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro japanese yen and british pound sterling exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us if our contractual indemnity is not upheld our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemicals potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

in addition there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities legislative bodies and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers or pbdes which are used as flame retardants we manufacture decabrompde a type of pbde compound in 2006 our net sales of decabrompde were less than 2 of total net sales government regulation including a ban on the use of decabrompde in certain applications if it occurs or the threat of regulation even if governmental regulation does not occur may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrompde 

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on an average interest rate of 524 at january 31 2007 and outstanding borrowings at that date of 7237 million our annual interest expense would be approximately 38 million a change of 0125 in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 1 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in the senior credit agreement the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

borrowings under our senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

baa3 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 

as of december 31 2006 we had 3560 employees approximately 20 of our 2150 us employees are unionized two of our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2007 and one expires in 2008 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although our pension plans are currently adequately funded events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the united states the netherlands germany belgium france and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 92 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

during 2006 we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately 125 funded on an irs funding basis as of december 31 2006 and as a result there are no required cash contributions to the plans in 2007 nor do we anticipate making discretionary contributions to the plans during 2007 however the actual amount of contributions could vary depending on factors such as asset returns thencurrent interest rates and legislative changes the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states or us and throughout the world as an acc member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 3 2006 we received a notice of violation “nov” from the us environmental protection agency region 4 “epa” regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg sc the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant we are currently engaged in discussions with the epa seeking to resolve these allegations but no assurances can be given that we will be able to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both parties any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines penalties capital expenditures or some combination thereof at this time it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of our discussions with the epa or the financial impact which may result there from however we do not expect any financial impact to have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability and premises liability litigation we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages as estimated by our general counsel we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend forwardlooking statements 

some of the information presented in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such forwardlooking statements are based on our current expectations which are in turn based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our current knowledge of our business and operations we have used words such as “anticipate” “believe” “could” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “may” “should” “will” and variations of such words and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements 

these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance therefore that our actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forwardlooking statements should circumstances change except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k 

the following is a discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” on page 35 

overview and outlook 

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals our products and services enhance the value of our customers’ endproducts by improving performance providing essential product attributes lowering cost and simplifying processing we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers including 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

manufacturers of consumer electronics building and construction materials automotive parts packaging pharmachemicals and agrichemicals and petroleum refiners we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise flexible lowcost global manufacturing base and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment new construction and increasingly stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of antipollution initiatives the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions 

2006 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 2007 outlook 

polymer additives growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment new construction and increasingly stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world in 2007 we expect stable volumes and continued pricing initiatives to offset raw material and energy costs that continue to rise we believe that in 2007 this segment may become our first billiondollar revenue market segment 

we are continuing our progress in china as a foundation for expanding our business in asia our technology center in nanjing is now operational this center provides technical support for our polymer additives customers in the asia pacific region in addition we plan to build a phosphorous flame retardant plant in nanjing which we believe could be fully operational in the second half of 2007 we intend to produce phosphorous flameretardants at this site to serve the growing asian construction and electronic markets 

catalysts  revenue growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be modest in 2007 as compared to 2006 being driven by global demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

fuel quality requirements as a part of antipollution initiatives we expect catalyst profit growth in 2007 will come primarily from new product introductions new markets that we penetrate fcc pricing improvements and the continued growth in our polyolefin catalyst business 

we expect conventional hpc catalysts volumes to remain stable for the entire year although refinery loading for new diesel sulfur specifications that went into effect in the united states on october 15 2006 is now complete we expect technology advantages and new product innovations will offset potential weakness in hpc in 2007 

as oil prices remain elevated we believe refiners will use more sour crudes which will require hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities further driving demand for these catalysts we have begun construction of our new hpc catalysts plant at bayport texas which is expected to be operational in second half of 2007 this plant will add approximately 10000 metric tons to our capacity we are evaluating whether additional capacity expansion in 2008 and 2009 may be needed due to expected increased demand 

our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins to support the value these products bring to the market in 2005 we announced the first significant price increase for these catalysts in over ten years and have focused in 2006 on achieving these increases in addition we expect to see incremental benefits in future quarters on our most recent fcc price increase that went into effect in january 2007 we believe that these price increases will help partially offset the increasing raw material and energy costs to manufacture these catalysts and will allow margin recovery and expansion for these catalysts 

we are focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced highthroughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the alternative fuels business which include biodiesel canadian tar sands gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil remains at historically high levels 

fine chemicals the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions we expect to continue the turnaround of our fine chemicals segment in 2007 as our revenue base is smaller following the sale of our thann france facility we expect profitability to improve in 2007 in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement our two strategic areas of focus in fine chemicals have been to maximize our bromine franchise value and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 

our goal is to profitably grow our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets 

we will also continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last three years allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical innovators in diverse industries we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

corporate and other the benefit of the belgianbased european trading company provides approximately 1 million monthly or 12 million annually in tax savings on a sustainable basis that began in the third quarter of 2006 as part of this trading company structure we have relocated certain of our longterm debt approximately 128 million from the us to europe where we believe we will be able to use lowertaxed foreign earnings to repay it locally in 2007 incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates we believe our global effective tax rate may approximate 23 but it will vary based on the locales in which incremental income is actually recognized we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and repaying debt in 2007 we have increased our quarterly dividend payout in 2007 to 0105 per share under our existing share repurchase program we expect to accelerate the amount of shares repurchased in 2007 as compared to 2006 we continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

results of operations 

the following data and discussion provides an analysis of certain significant factors affecting our results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income 

selected financial data 

 

   comparison of 2006 to 2005 

net sales 

for 2006 we recorded net sales of 2369 million an increase of 261 million or 12 compared to the net sales of 2108 for 2005 this increase was mainly due to improved pricing and increased volume in our polymer additives and catalysts segments improved pricing in our fine chemicals segment and the addition of our south haven facility partially offset by the effects of the divestiture of our thann facility overall prices increased 10 and volumes grew 4 compared to the same period last year 

polymer additives’ net sales were 920 million up 123 million or 15 for 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 as prices rose 11 and volume grew 6 catalysts’ net sales were 839 million up 101 million or 14 due mainly to a 9 increase in prices and a 7 increase in volume fine chemicals’ net sales increased to 609 million up 37 million or 6 primarily due to improved pricing of 10 however this increase was partially offset by reduced volumes of 2 for a detailed discussion of revenues and segment income before taxes for each segment and division see “segment information overview” below 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

gross profit 

for 2006 our gross profit increased 127 million to 551 million or 30 from 2005 due to increased volume and improved pricing these increases were partially offset by increased raw material and manufacturing in addition our catalysts segment had higher manufacturing costs associated with a planned shutdown at our pasadena texas polyolefin catalysts plant our gross profit margin for 2006 increased to 233 from 201 in 2005 

selling general and administrative and research and development expenses 

for 2006 our selling general and administrative expenses or sga and research and development expenses or rd increased 23 million or 9 from 2005 this increase was primarily due to higher sga costs from increased consulting fees related to the implementation of the belgianbased european trading company and increased wages and incentive compensation as a percentage of net sales sga and rd were 120 in 2006 versus 124 in 2005 

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for 2006 amounted to 44 million an increase of 2 million from 42 million in 2005 this increase was primarily due to the consolidation of jordan bromine company limited or jbc effective august 1 2005 and the impact of an additional 3 million on our interest and financing expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 resulting from the inclusion of the debt of jbc the higher interest and financing expenses were also impacted by higher rates on our average outstanding debt in 2006 interest and financing expenses for 2005 included the writeoff of 1 million of deferred financing expenses associated with a 450 million 364day bridge loan that we retired in january 2005 

other income expenses net 

for 2006 our other income expenses net was nominal but decreased 2 million from 2005 this decrease was primarily due to a foreign exchange adjustment of approximately 3 million on foreign denominated debt at jbc partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately 1 million 

income taxes 

our income taxes for 2006 were 2 million a decrease of 25 million or 92 from 2005 income taxes for 2006 benefited 22 million from earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the us statutory rate due to designating the undistributed earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries as permanently reinvested as of september 30 2006 9 million from the impact of tax rate changes principally the netherlands and various states on our deferred tax liabilities and 9 million from foreign tax credits related to repatriation of high taxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries 

income taxes for 2005 benefited 6 million from the repatriation of overseas earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 known as the homeland investment act and 7 million from foreign tax credits related to repatriation of high taxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2005 we determined that certain of our reported income tax accounts were overstated based on our detailed reviews accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit of 8 million associated with the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to income tax rate changes in the netherlands in addition the deferred income tax account as recorded under accounting principles board or apb opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes – special areas” reflects an additional expense of 5 million related to the proper recording and identification of earnings and profits or ep adjustments in connection with acquired companies the net impact of these two adjustments amounting to an income tax benefit of 2 million did not have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 or any prior periods presented 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 16 versus 224 in 2005 excluding the thann charge and related tax impact the effective tax rate for 2006 was 148 the decrease from 2005 is due primarily to management’s decision to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries tax rate changes and the benefits from foreign tax credits associated with high taxed earnings from foreign operations below is an explanation of the changes in effective income tax rates for the applicable years 

 

 minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests’ share of net income was 13 million in 2006 compared to 7 million in 2005 our minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries included minority ownership charges of approximately 7 million for jbc for 2006 compared to 2 million for 2005 as jbc was an unconsolidated investment until august 2005 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments 

equity in net income of unconsolidated investments decreased 1 million to 25 million in 2006 from 26 million in 2005 due to the consolidation of jbc for the full year of 2006 partially offset by an increase in the equity income of our catalysts’ segment joint ventures of 5 million which had strong sales and improved pricing equity income of 8 million for our portion of jbc’s earnings was included in 2005 prior to august 1 at which time we began accounting for jbc as a consolidated subsidiary 

net income 

our net income increased 24 to 143 million in 2006 from 115 million in 2005 primarily due to increased sales improved margins and reduced taxes partially offset by the thann divestiture charge of 89 million 58 million after income taxes 

segment information overview we have identified three reportable segments as required by sfas no 131 our polymer additives segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas our catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas our fine chemicals segment is comprised of the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas effective january 1 2006 we revised the way we evaluate the performance of our segment results to include the impact of the minority interest ownership in our consolidated subsidiaries termed “minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries” in our segment income segment income represents operating profit and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments and is reduced by minority interests in income of our consolidated subsidiaries stannica llc and jbc segment results for the year ended december 31 2005 have been reclassified to reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews our three segments the change in segment income resulted from the effect of the consolidation of jbc effective august 1 2005 and the related minority interest in income on our consolidated full year operating results consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews each segment segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses allocations for certain corporate costs equity in net income of unconsolidated investments and is reduced by minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries segment results including effective income tax rate calculations for 2005 have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the revisions this change in presentation had no impact on our reported net income for the years presented

catalysts 

our catalysts segment had net sales for 2006 of 839 million up 101 million or 14 versus 2005 due mainly to a 12 pricing improvement and increased volume of 14 in refinery catalysts and 4 pricing improvement and increased volume of 12 in polyolefin catalysts pricing of hpc catalysts reflects certain metal costs which are largely passed through to our end customers these pass through charges have declined as metal prices have moderated resulting in revenue reductions in 2006 versus 2005 product margins however have increased segment income increased 29 or 28 million to 123 million due mainly to higher pricing and increased volume offset by increased raw material cost and higher manufacturing costs associated with a planned shutdown at our pasadena texas polyolefin catalysts plant for 2006 as compared to 2005 which included special item curtailment gains of 4 million related to benefit plan changes in addition equity income of our catalysts joint ventures increased 5 million compared to the same period last year due to strong sales and improved pricing 

fine chemicals 

fine chemicals segment net sales for 2006 were 609 million up 37 million or 6 versus 2005 this increase was due mainly to pricing improvements of 13 across the bromine portfolio and higher prices and increased volume of 5 and 7 respectively in our fine chemistry services and the addition of the south haven facility partially offsetting the revenue increase were volume reductions of 6 in our bromine portfolio and the divestiture of our thann facility excluding the thann divestiture charge of 89 million in 2006 fine chemicals segment income increased to 62 million up 18 million or 40 for 2006 from 2005 inclusive of a special item gain of 1 million due to improved pricing partially offset by increased manufacturing and raw material costs 

corporate and other 

for 2006 our corporate and other expenses increased 3 million or 7 to 55 million from 2005 which included a 2 million special item charge this increase was primarily due to higher sga costs for consulting fees related to the implementation of a belgianbased european trading company and increased wages and incentive compensation partially offset by the minority interest portion of the foreign exchange adjustment on foreign currency denominated debt at jbc

interest and financing expenses 

interest and financing expenses for 2005 amounted to 42 million an increase of 25 million from 17 million in 2004 this increase was primarily due to a full year’s interest in 2005 on the debt outstanding that relates primarily to the july 2004 acquisition of the refinery catalysts business the higher interest and financing expenses were also impacted by higher rates on our average outstanding debt in 2005 

other income expenses net 

other income expenses net for 2005 amounted to 2 million in income an increase of 14 million from 2004 the increase is due to the absence of the 2004 eurodenominated hedging losses of 13 million associated with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business in 2004

summary of critical accounting policies 

estimates and assumptions 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables we also provide for claims receivables that are subject to legal proceedings 

depreciation depreciation is computed primarily by the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets we have a policy where our internal engineering group provides asset life guidelines for book purposes these guidelines are 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

reviewed against the economic life of the business for each project and asset life is determined as the lesser of the manufacturing life or the “business” life the engineering guidelines are reviewed periodically 

inventory obsolescence inventories are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine age movement and turnover reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

acquisition accounting we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

legal accruals we estimate the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that we may incur with respect to litigation claims and assessments 

performance and life cycle guarantees we provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees these guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered product must meet such as yield and product quality life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered product is guaranteed when either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated 

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing 1 the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter 2 the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and 3 the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 

claims receivable 

we record receivables for nontrade claims on a casebycase basis whenever management deems that the claim for recovery is probable recording of such receivables is preceded by the gathering and evaluation of factually supportable evidence and conditions surrounding the claim and is generally based on application of specific contractual terms with third parties from which the claim arises in accordance with gaap we evaluate these receivables for collectibility on a regular basis and we record provisions for uncollectible amounts when subsequent conditions indicate that collection of all or part of the receivable is not probable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets not be amortized 

we test goodwill for impairment using a twostep method by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving cash flows consistent with the objective of measuring fair value based on reasonable and supportive assumptions we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to thirtyfive years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets see note 9 “goodwill and other intangibles” 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

we follow the guidance of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans —an amendment of certain requirements of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132 r” sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets as required under sfas no 158 we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the difference between a plan’s funded status and its balance sheet position prior to adoption of the standard is recognized net of tax as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets sfas no 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 and is to be applied prospectively amounts provided for years prior to 2006 contain delayed recognition differences between actual results and expected or estimated results based on the prior guiding principle of the standards the delayed recognition of actual results allowed for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans the primary assumptions are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2006 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to fixedincome security yields including high quality bonds moody’s aa and the international index company or iboxx aa corporate bond rates along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans the yield curve was produced for a universe containing usissued aagraded corporate bonds all of which were noncallable nonputable and nonsinkable for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments at december 31 2006 the weightedaverage discount rate was increased for the pension plans from 546 to 578 and for the other postretirement plans from 561 to 581 as a result of higher market rates and a relatively flat yield curve for longterm high quality bonds 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2006 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from 831 to 806 and there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 700 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2006 and 2005 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 362 and 283 respectively for the pension plans the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 370 and 297 for the other postretirement plans at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2006 the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was increased the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2006 and 2005 for pre65 coverage was 9 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 in year 2010 and 2009 respectively the trend rate for post65 coverage was 10 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 in the year 2011 and 2010 respectively for 2007 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the trend rate for pre65 coverage is again increased to 9 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 in the year 2011 the trend rate for post65 coverage is increased to 10 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 in the year 2012 

the postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the netherlands who retire after august 2009 includes an assumed increase in benefits of 15 per year however we elected that effective january 1 2007 the netherlands postretirement medical benefits would lapse therefore this plan will be settled in january 2007 and we will have no future liabilities under this plan 

the effect of a 1 increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit cost components by 01 million and would increase the benefit obligation by 04 million a 1 decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit cost components by 01 million and would decrease the benefit obligation by 05 million 

a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the united states in thousands 

 

  income taxes 

we use the liability method for determining our income taxes under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates under this method the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 

deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 

we are subject to periodic audit of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter which result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income tax rules in the united states the internal revenue service has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year 2002 in 2006 tax assessments were received from the irs for the years 2000 through 2002 we have taken the issues contested to the appeals process our financial statements reflect the outcome we believe will ultimately result from this appeals process given the uncertainty that exists in the appeals process and the lack of assurances of the anticipated outcome for the years after 2002 our income tax returns are either under review by the irs or could be subject to the irs’ review 

prior to september 30 2006 except as otherwise noted it was our policy to record deferred income tax liabilities on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that were not deemed to be permanently reinvested in those operations as of september 30 2006 we designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result recorded a tax benefit of 16 million due to the reversal of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities we will not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries as a result of this designation our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been provided as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 

as further discussed in note 16 “income taxes” we asserted that we are permanently reinvested with respect to earnings derived from our investment in jbc for all periods beginning after september 30 2005 

investments 

we have investments in joint ventures nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities the majority of our investments are in joint ventures since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 although other factors such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate our share of the investee’s earnings is included in the consolidated statement of income as “equity in net income of unconsolidated investments” it is also included in our computation of segment income investments in marketable securities are accounted for as both availableforsale securities with changes in fair value included in “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and trading equities that are markedtomarket on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income joint ventures’ and nonmarketable securities’ results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 

internal control over financial reporting 

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp attests to our management’s assertion and provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in part i item 9a 

we have a dedicated sox 404 team in house to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews coordinate the process for these reviews provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting a steering committee comprised of personnel from finance and alliance services is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox 404 team status updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it is an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us even stronger 

financial condition and liquidity 

overview 

the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets funding working capital and repayment of debt cash to fund the needs of our business has been provided primarily by operations debt financing and equity issuances 

we expect business activity levels to continue to increase over the next twelve to twentyfour months the increase in business activity may cause our working capital needs to increase we have initiated a program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory we expect our current cash balances and our availability under our revolving credit facility which is discussed below to be sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash flow 

our cash balance increased by 909 million to 1495 million at december 31 2006 from 586 million at december 31 2005 for 2006 our operations provided 3763 million of cash compared to 1689 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in net income excluding the net thann divestiture charge as well as a net improvement in working capital accounts cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of 1451 million which consisted principally of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements the acquisition of the assets and fine chemistry services and pharmaceuticals business 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

associated with the south haven michigan facility of dsm pharmaceutical products dsm and thann facility divestiture payments remaining cash flows from operating activities together with proceeds from borrowings of 1343 million and the exercise of stock options of 214 million funded longterm debt repayments of 2393 million purchases of our common stock of 318 million and quarterly dividends to shareholders this resulted in net cash used by financing activity of 1435 million 

net current assets increased 262 million to 4779 million at december 31 2006 from 4517 million at december 31 2005 the increase in net current assets was due primarily to an increase in cash partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2005 were 586 million up 122 million from 464 million at yearend 2004 for 2005 cash flows provided from operating activities of 1689 million together with approximately 3247 million and 1479 million proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and common stock respectively 1920 million of proceeds from borrowings and 63 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options were used to cover operating activities repay debt of 7082 million fund capital expenditures totaling 701 million pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of 264 million fund investments amounting to 36 million pay dividends to minority interest of 34 million pay 23 million in financing costs and increase cash and cash equivalents by 122 million 

our foreign currency translation adjustments net of related deferred taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity on pages 45 and 46 increased from december 31 2005 primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro accumulated other comprehensive loss income also includes unrecognized losses and prior service benefit for our defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 158 

capital expenditures in 2006 of 998 million were approximately 42 higher than the 2005 level of 701 million to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales we expect our capital spending program to be approximately 1000 million in 2007 and 2008 capital spending in 2007 for environmental and safety projects is expected to be higher than that of 2006 which was slightly lower than that in 2005 driven by environmental regulations and our commitment towards sustainability goals we anticipate that future capital spending will be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

longterm debt 

we currently have 3250 million of 510 senior notes that are due in 2015 these notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 

the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 

for additional funding and liquidity purposes we currently maintain a senior credit agreement with financial institutions that consists of a 3000 million revolving credit facility and a 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility in june 2006 we amended our senior credit facilities to add certain additional subsidiary borrowers located outside the us and to allow borrowings by our foreign subsidiaries to be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar key terms of this agreement remain unchanged there was an aggregate of 3167 million equivalent outstanding under the fiveyear term loan facility at december 31 2006 the aggregate of 3167 million equivalent outstanding was comprised of 2208 million of borrowings denominated in us dollars borrowed by domestic subsidiaries and €727 million 960 million based on the applicable exchange rate on december 31 2006 of borrowings denominated in euros borrowed by a subsidiary in the netherlands borrowings under the fiveyear term loan facility bear interest at variable rates which was a weighted average of 561 for the year ended december 31 2006 as of december 31 2006 borrowings under the domestic portion of the 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility bore a variable interest rate of 610 per annum the 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

4500 million fiveyear term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of 74 million and €24 million 32 million based on the applicable exchange rate on december 31 2006 through june 30 2008 and quarterly payments of 589 million and €194 million 256 million based on the applicable exchange rate on december 31 2006 at september 30 2008 december 31 2008 and march 31 2009 

borrowings under our senior credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following financial covenants a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined must be greater than or equal to 125100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter b consolidated debt to capitalization ratio as defined at the end of any fiscal quarter must be less than or equal to 60 c consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined must be or greater than or equal to 7500 million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states and d with the exception of liens specified in our new senior credit agreement liens may not attach to assets where the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens at any time exceeds 10 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreements 

we believe that as of december 31 2006 we were and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants noncompliance with any one or more of the debt covenants may have an adverse effect on financial condition or liquidity in the event such noncompliance cannot be cured or should we be unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders renegotiation of the covenant through an amendment to the senior credit agreement may effectively cure the noncompliance but may have an effect on financial condition or liquidity depending upon how the covenant is renegotiated 

the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 6819 million at december 31 2006 compared to 7759 million at december 31 2005 in addition at december 31 2006 we had the ability to borrow an additional 4441 million under our various credit arrangements 

other obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment unused letters of credit and various take or pay and throughput agreements in thousands 

 

  liquidity outlook 

we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our senior credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future for flexibility we maintain a shelf registration statement that permits us to issue from time to time a range of securities including common stock preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt of up to 2200 million in addition as we have historically done we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses which may require additional liquidity

capitalization 

on january 20 2005 we completed the concurrent public offerings of 8976840 shares on a split adjusted basis of our common stock of which an aggregate of 976840 shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald jr and certain affiliates of the family and 3250 million of 510 senior notes due 2015 we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders our portion of the common stock offering sale after the inclusion of 1146000 overallotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters which was completed on january 28 2005 totaled 9146000 shares the shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of 1700 per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of 99897 of par we used the net proceeds from both of our offerings to repay the 4500 million 364day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

safety and environmental matters 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party or prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases our participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately 358 million in 2006 versus approximately 306 million in 2005 and 295 million in 2004 excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2006 totaled approximately 296 million up 07 million from 289 million at december 31 2005 

we believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded if any should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period see also item 3 legal proceedings on page 17 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 57 million 95 million and 111 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively for each of the next few years capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and working towards sustainability goals management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” or sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating what impact the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on our reported results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans —an amendment of certain requirements of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132 r” or sfas no 158 sfas no 158 requires companies to recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of their pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date the difference between a plan’s funded status and its balance sheet position prior to adoption of the standard is recognized net of tax as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets sfas no 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 the adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss income of 949 million offset primarily by a decrease in prepaid pension assets 1417 million and a decrease in noncurrent deferred tax liabilities 499 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb staff position “accounting for planned major maintenance activities” or fsp no aug air1 fsp no aug air1 addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities and amends certain provisions in the aicpa industry audit guide “audits of airlines” and apb opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” fsp no aug air1 prohibits the use of the accrueinadvance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods fsp no aug air1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the adoption of fsp no aug air1 is not expected to have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 

in september 2006 the staff of the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” or sab 108 sab 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements sab 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered is material sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not have any impact on our reported results of operations 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” or sfas no 123r prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stockbased awards under the intrinsic value method which followed the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion “apb” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock awards at fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and for stock options to the extent exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant compensation expense for performance unit awards was recognized based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the end of each quarterly reporting period until distribution to the extent restricted stock awards and performance unit awards were forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest the modified prospective method does not require financial amounts for the prior periods presented in this form 10k to be restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing sharebased compensation the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date and the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” such value is recognized as expense over the service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant to the extent restricted stock awards performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 

the application of sfas no 123r had the following effect on december 31 2006 reported amounts relative to amounts that would have been reported using the intrinsic value method under previous accounting in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 the impact of sfas no 123r resulted in additional compensation expense related to stock options not fully vested as of january 1 2006 11 million this was more than offset by the benefit of not recording additional compensation expense during 2006 for outstanding performance unit awards which otherwise would have been required under previous accounting standards under those standards performance units were required to be recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period in accordance with sfas no 123r performance units are now based on a grant date fair value consequently our stockbased compensation expense associated with outstanding performance unit awards was favorably impacted by 132 million during the current year as the fair value at grant date was lower than the fair value at the end of the reporting period or december 31 2006 

the following table illustrates the effects on net income and earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 to stockbased employee awards in thousands except per share amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from timetotime of foreign exchange contracts the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties however we do not anticipate nonperformance by the other parties and no material loss would be expected from their nonperformance we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which generally expire within one year in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2006 no such contracts were outstanding 

in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price which was denominated in euros as a result we incurred a net charge of approximately 128 million during the year ended december 31 2004 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings at december 31 2006 of 3330 million bearing an average interest rate of 554 a change of 0125 in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 04 million we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 

in 2004 we entered into treasury lock agreements or tlocks with a notional value of 2750 million to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85 of our january 2005 public offering of senior notes the tlocks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 425 the value of the tlocks resulted from the difference between 1 the yieldtomaturity of the 10year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and 2 the fixed rate of approximately 425 the cumulative loss effect of the tlock agreements was 22 million and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense at december 31 2006 there were unrealized losses of approximately 18 million 11 million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss income that remain to be expensed 

in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market we purchase natural gas contracts when appropriate for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 

our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market the unrealized gains andor losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive loss income to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2006 there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding additionally any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate but do not have a significant impact on results of operations

business segments 

  our operations are managed and reported as three operating segments polymer additives catalysts and fine chemicals 

  for financial information regarding our operating segments including revenues generated for each of the last three fiscal years from each of the product categories included in our operating segments and geographic areas see note 19 “operating segments and geographic area information” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 37 

polymer additives 

  our polymer additives segment consists of two product categories flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives 

  flame retardants our flame retardants help materials in a wide variety of finished products meet firesafety requirements some of the products that benefit from our flame retardants include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics printed circuit boards wire and cable electrical connectors foam seating in furniture and automobiles and textiles we compete in all of the major flame retardant markets brominated mineral and phosphorus our brominated flame retardants include products such as saytex ® and pyrochek ®  our mineralbased flame retardants include products such as martinal ® and magnifin ® and our phosphorusbased flame retardants include products such as antiblaze ® and ncendx ®  our strategy is to have a broad range of chemistries applicable to each major flame retardant application 

  stabilizers and curatives we produce plastic and other additives such as curatives antioxidants and stabilizers which are often specially developed and formulated for a customer’s specific manufacturing requirements our plastic additives products include curatives for polyurethane and epoxy system polymerization as well as for ultraviolet curing of various inks and coatings this business also produces antioxidants and stabilizers to improve the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins 

  our ethacure ® curatives are used in cast elastomers coatings reaction injection molding rim and specialty adhesives that are incorporated into products such as wheels tires and rollers our line of ethanox ® antioxidants is used by manufacturers of polyolefins to maintain physical properties during the manufacturing process including the color of the final product these antioxidants are found in applications such as slit film wire and cable food packaging and pipes 

  we also produce antioxidants used in fuels and lubricants our line of ethanox ® fuel and lubricant antioxidants are used by refiners and fuel marketers to extend fuel storage life and protect fuel systems and by oil marketers and lubricant manufacturers to extend the useful life of lubricating oils fluids and greases used in engines and various types of machinery 

  our joint venture stannica llc produces organic and inorganic tin intermediates used as a key raw material in the production of tin based pvc heat stabilizers tin stabilizers are used in the processing of rigid pipe window profiles siding fencing and some flexible packaging pvc applications pvc heat stabilizers help prevent the thermal degradation of pvc resins during periods of elevated temperature exposure such as during processing and help extend the useful life of finished products 

  customers 

  the polymer additives segment offers more than 70 products to a variety of endmarkets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers lubricant manufacturers refiners and other specialty chemical companies 

  sales of polymer additives are growing rapidly in asia due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the united states europe and the middle east in addition we have joint venture manufacturing sites in china 

  a number of customers of our polymer additives segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical however because our polymer additives products are used in many different industries and for a wide variety of uses there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings except with respect to certain consumer electronicsrelated flame retardants 

  competition 

  the markets served by our polymer additives segment are highly competitive we invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services in order to compete effectively in the polymer additives marketplace 

  competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers in endproducts in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries which has caused us to expand our product portfolio to include bromine phosphorus and mineral chemistries that are common in over 80 of end uses today for other additives competition is introduced by lowcost antioxidant suppliers we have begun to offer our basic products from lower cost sources and have pursued new blending technology to produce better more easily processed forms of antioxidant blends 

  our most significant competitors in the brominated flame retardant business are chemtura corporation and israel chemicals ltd industrial products division or israel chemicals our most significant competitor in the phosphorusbased flame retardant business is supresta llc our competitors in the mineralbased flame retardants business are almatis kyowa hakko kogyo co ltd and nabaltec gmbh our most significant competitors in the plastic additives business are ciba specialty chemicals akzo nobel and rohm and haas 

  raw materials and significant supply contracts 

  the major raw materials we use in our polymer additives operations are bromine bisphenola and phenol caustic soda phosphorus oxychloride aluminum trihydrate polystyrene isobutylene and phosphorous derivatives most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

  the bromine we use in our polymer additives segment comes from our brine reserves in arkansas which are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company limited or jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea 

  our subsidiary martinswerk gmbh has certain contracts that require it to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate from its suppliers our annual requirements for aluminum trihydrate currently exceed these minimum purchase requirements we also entered into a range of phosphorus derivative supply agreements with rhodia sa as part of the acquisition of the rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business 

catalysts 

  our catalysts segment includes refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product categories 

  refinery catalysts our two main catalysts product lines are hydroprocessing or hpc catalysts and fluidized catalytic cracking or fcc catalysts and additives 

  hpc catalysts are primarily used to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products as well as to convert heavy feedstock into lighter more valuable products fcc catalysts assist in the cracking of petroleum streams into derivative higher 

value products such as fuels and petrochemical feedstock our fcc additives can be used to remove sulfur in gasoline and to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in fcc units to increase lpg olefins yield and to boost octane in gasoline we offer more than 90 different hpc catalysts products and more than 70 different fcc catalysts and additives products to our customers 

  polyolefin catalysts  we manufacture aluminum and magnesiumalkyls which are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins such as polypropylene and polyethylene used in plastic products elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates we also produce metallocenesinglesite catalysts which aid in the development and production of new polymers that increase impact strength clarity and melt characteristics of plastic films we are continuing to build on our organometallics base and to expand the portfolio of products and capabilities we offer our customers 

  customers 

  the customers of our catalysts segment include multinational corporations such as exxonmobil corporation royal dutch petroleum company and chevrontexaco corporation independent petroleum refining companies such as valero energy corporation and tesoro petroleum corporation and national petroleum refining companies such as saudi aramco mobil refinery company ltd petróleo brasileiro sa and petróleos mexicanos 

  we estimate that there are currently approximately 450 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 2000 hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to three years we believe that our existing relationships with global petroleum refiners developed by our other business segments present opportunities to grow the market share of our new refinery catalysts business 

  competition 

  in the catalysts segment hpc and fcc catalysts competition is primarily from major catalysts companies our major competitors in the hpc catalysts market are criterion catalysts and technologies and wr grace  coadvanced refining technologies and our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market are wr grace  co and engelhard corporation some of the major catalysts companies have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction our major competitors in the polyolefin market include akzo nobel nv axens nv basell service company bv chemtura corporation tosoh corporation univation technologies llc and wr grace  co 

  we seek to enhance our competitive position by developing product and process improvements and specialized customer services through our research and development we strive to develop valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

  raw materials 

  the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alpha olefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin molybdenum nickel and cobalt most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility certain critical raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility for example molybdenum prices increased more than fourfold in 2004 and remained at over 600 of the 10year average in 2005 our profitability may be reduced if we are unable to pass along such price increases to our customers 

fine chemicals 

  our fine chemicals segment consists of two product categories performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

  performance chemicals performance chemicals include products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids paper manufacturing water purification glass manufacturing photography and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants biocides disinfectants and sanitizers potassium and chlorinebased products used in glass making and various other industrial applications alkenyl succinic anhydride used in papersizing formulations and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications we sell these products to customers throughout the world for use in personal care products automotive insulation foundry bricks and other industrial products 

  fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemical products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described below our fine chemistry services or fcs business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for companies we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs 

  our most significant bulk active is ibuprofen ibuprofen is widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen is formulated by pharmaceutical companies that sell in both the prescription and overthecounter markets this product competes against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

  our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

  in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemicals potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons and peppers 

  current regulations allow us to continue to sell methyl bromide into our current markets through 2006 with a reduction allowance for critical uses of 11 from our 2005 allowance amount in accordance with the montreal protocol and the us clean air act completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the united states western europe and japan took effect in 2005 methyl bromide however can continue to be used for critical uses where there are no other alternatives growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses once approved by us environmental protection agency or the epa the united states submits the application for approval by the parties to the montreal protocol the critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

  customers 

  the fine chemicals segment manufactures more than 100 products which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies 

  pricing for many of our fine chemicals is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

  competition 

  competition in the fine chemicals segment is intense and varies within each of our different product groups in the brominebased products groups we primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers chemtura corporation and israel chemicals in pharmaceutical bulk actives  ie  ibuprofen and propofol we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation astrazeneca plc clariant ltd and cilag ag however there is increasing competition from asian sources we are seeking to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

  raw materials 

  the major raw materials we use in our fine chemicals operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alpha olefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

  the bromine that we use in our fine chemicals segment comes from three primary sources arkansas jordan and israel chemicals the arkansas brine reserves are supported by an active brine rights leasing program where we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in addition through our 50 interest in jbc a consolidated joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea which has unlimited reserves finally we purchase bromine used in our facility in thann france from israel chemicals pursuant to a longterm contract 

sales marketing and distribution 

  we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service we also use more than 50 selected distributors commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

research and development 

  we believe that in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and processes based on proprietary technologies 

  our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer additives is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants and improving existing flame retardants to meet higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and value added plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

  catalysts research is focused on the needs of both our refinery catalysts customers and our polyolefin catalysts customers refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the polyolefin area we are focused primarily on developing catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems to polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers 

  the primary focus of our fine chemicals research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of biocides for industrial and recreational water treatment and other applications especially products based on bromine chemistry

  our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act or osha we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2005 with a company record low ohsa recordable injury rateillness rate of 037 over the past two years our osha recordable injury incidence rate was in the top 10 of all chemical companies who are members of the american chemistry council or the acc 

  our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new requirements under the european commission’s proposal for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach as proposed reach would impose obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance and perform chemical safety assessments additionally substances of high concern  such as carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic cmrs persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbts very persistent very bioaccumulative vpvb and endocrine disruptors  will be subject to an authorization process per application while it is uncertain when and in what form the reach proposal will become law the proposed new regulations would 

impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers importers downstream users of chemical substances and preparations and the entire supply chain our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union would likely require us to incur significant additional compliance costs including the hiring of additional employees to coordinate the additional reporting requirements and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand 

environmental regulation 

  we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to them and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

  liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the united states and similar foreign and state laws our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to us we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not be material to operations 

  we record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters in accordance with the guidelines of the aicpa statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” and sfas no 143 “ accounting for asset retirement obligations” respectively when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated future developments including developments affecting contractual indemnification rights we believe we have as well as contractual or other obligations that we may have and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 33 

other recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

  over the last three years we have devoted a significant amount of resources to acquisitions including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses and to joint ventures these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries the following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years 

  on july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of the akzo nobel refinery catalysts business for approximately 763 million including expenses at applicable exchange rates during 2004 and 2005 we increased the purchase price by approximately 23 million and 8 million respectively due primarily to payments to akzo nobel as part of the postclosing working capital adjustments during 2005 significant progress was made in the determination of the final purchase price allocation versus the estimated allocation at december 31 2004 however none of the changes made to the december 31 2004 allocation were material to our financial position or results of operations as part of the acquisition we acquired 50 ownership of nonconsolidated joint ventures in brazil fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa japan nippon ketjen co ltd and france eurecat sa with affiliates in the united states saudi arabia and italy 

  effective january 1 2004 we acquired the business assets customer lists and other intangibles of taerim international corporation for approximately 3 million and formed albemarle korea corporation which is located in seoul south korea 

  on december 2 2003 we acquired the bromine fine chemicals business of atofina chemicals inc for approximately 85 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities the acquisition included atofina’s production facility in port de bouc france as well as a longterm supply agreement with atofina for certain fine chemicals the acquisition provided us with flexibility in raw material supply and complemented our existing network of brominebased facilities 

  on july 23 2003 we acquired the phosphorusbased polyurethane flame retardants businesses of rhodia sa which included a production site in avonmouth in the united kingdom and supply contracts for flame retardants and intermediates manufactured at rhodia’s sites in charleston south carolina and in oldbury and widnes in the united kingdom the acquisition purchase price totaled approximately 81 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities 

  on january 21 2003 we acquired newmarket corporation’s formerly ethyl corporation fuel and lubricant antioxidants working capital patents and other intellectual property for approximately 27 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities 

employees 

  as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 3700 employees of whom approximately 2050 or 55 are employed in the united states approximately 1550 or 42 are employed in europe and approximately 100 or 3 are employed in asia approximately 20 of our us employees are unionized we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations 

baton rouge louisiana—united steel workers usw 

orangeburg south carolina—international brotherhood of teamsters—industrial trades division and 

pasadena texas—united steel workers usw sheet metal workers international association united association of journeymen  apprentices of plumbing and pipefitting industry and international brotherhood of electrical workers 

  we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than 10 years two of our bargaining agreements expire in 2007 and one expires in 2008 

  we have four works councils representing the majority of our european sites—amsterdam and amersfoort the netherlands thann and portdebouc france and bergheim germany—covering approximately 1400 employees in addition we have approximately 60 employees at our manufacturing facility in avonmouth united kingdom that are represented by unions through a current collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives is generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

  our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

  our raw material and energy costs increased significantly in 2005 the increases were primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 

  in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products   we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

  downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

  our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

  our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions which may prevent farming for extended periods 

  changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

  our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

  our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

  the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

  we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new 

products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

  our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

  we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

  we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

  our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states we and our joint ventures currently have 25 facilities located outside the united states including facilities and offices located in austria belgium brazil france germany italy japan jordan korea the netherlands the people’s republic of china saudi arabia and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency 

transportation and other shipping costs may increase 

intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce 

foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment including currency exchange controls 

unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur 

agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect 

compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome 

unexpected adverse changes in export duties quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses 

general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries 

foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes 

foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises and 

our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities 

  in addition certain of our joint ventures operate in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

  we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro japanese yen and british pound sterling exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

  we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

  in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

  violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 

  if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

  contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

  at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us in 2004 we commenced an arbitration proceeding against aventis sa concerning its obligations with respect to contamination at our thann france facility after aventis refused to accept our demands for indemnification under the contract pursuant to which we acquired the facility if our contractual indemnity is not upheld our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

  concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

  we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have marketed methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemicals potential to deplete the ozone layer completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january 1 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 

  in addition there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers or pbdes which are used as flame retardants we manufacture decabrompde a type of pbde compound in 2005 our net sales of decabrompde were less than 3 of total net sales government regulation if it occurs or the threat of regulation even if governmental regulation does not occur may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrompde 

  we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

  our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

  our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to react to changes in our industry or to implement our strategic initiatives 

  as of december 31 2005 we had total indebtedness of 8335 million 

  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us for example it could 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes 

limit our ability to secure additional financing to implement our strategic initiatives 

increase the amount of our interest expense because approximately half of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which if interest rates increase or our credit ratings decline will result in higher interest expense 

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt 

restrict us from making strategic acquisitions introducing new technologies or otherwise exploiting business opportunities 

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness and 

limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness among other things our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets or pay cash dividends 

  in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing our 510 senior notes due 2015 do not prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify 

  we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

  our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on an average interest rate of 517 at february 28 2006 and outstanding borrowings at that date of 8436 million our annual interest expense would be 436 million a change of 0125 in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 11 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

  restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

  our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in the senior credit agreement the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

  borrowings under our senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services or sp and moody’s investors services or moody’s sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa3 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

  our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

  our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

  the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

  we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

  we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

  we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or 

distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 

  if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

  the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

  some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 

  as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 3700 employees approximately 20 of our 2050 us employees are unionized two of our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2007 and one expires in 2008 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

  our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

  we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

  as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

unforeseen claims and liabilities including unexpected environmental exposures 

unforeseen adjustments charges and writeoffs 

problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities 

unexpected losses of customers of or suppliers to the acquired business 

difficulty in conforming the acquired business’ standards processes procedures and controls with our operations 

variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting 

inability to coordinate new product and process development 

loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions and 

challenges arising from the increased scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 

  although our pension plans are currently adequately funded events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

  we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the united states the netherlands germany belgium france and japan covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 80 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

  during 2005 we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately 130 funded on an irs funding basis as of december 31 2005 and as a result there are no required cash contributions to the plans in 2006 however the actual amount of contributions made subsequent to 2005 will depend upon asset returns thencurrent interest rates and a number of other factors the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly specifically if yearend accumulated obligations exceed assets we may elect to make a voluntary contribution over and above the minimum required in order to avoid additional minimum liability charges to our balance sheet and consequent reductions to shareholders’ equity these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

  the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

  chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states or us and throughout the world as an acc member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

  new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

  the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  on april 2 2004 albemarle overseas development company or aodc one of our wholly owned subsidiaries initiated a request for arbitration against aventis sa the predecessor in interest to sanofi aventis or aventis through the international chamber of commerce international court of arbitration paris france the dispute arises out of a 1992 stock purchase agreement or agreement between aodc and a predecessor to aventis under which 100 of the stock of potasse et produits chimiques sa now known as albemarle ppc or appc was acquired by aodc the dispute relates to a chemical facility in thann france owned by appc where the french government has required a detailed risk study of groundwater contamination and in 2005 instructed appc to conduct a number of additional tests and studies and take certain measures with respect to the containment of certain contamination at and the emission of certain materials from the thann facility by reason of certain intervening assignments of rights albemarle france sas another wholly owned subsidiary of albemarle corporation was substituted for adoc as the party in interest in the arbitration 

  the request for arbitration requests indemnification by aventis for certain costs incurred by appc in connection with any environmental claims of the french government for the appc facility and a declaratory judgment as to the liability of aventis under the agreement for costs to be incurred in the future by appc in connection with such claims under the terms of the agreement we believe that aventis is obligated to indemnify aodc and appc and hold them harmless from certain claims losses damages costs or any other present or prospective liabilities arising out of certain soil and groundwater contamination at the site in thann 

  arbitration hearings related to the question of liability took place in june 2005 and we currently expect a response from the arbitration panel in 2006 

  at this time it is not possible to predict what additional studies or measures if any the french government may require since these matters are in the initial stages and environmental matters are subject to many uncertainties we believe however that we are entitled to be fully indemnified by aventis for all liabilities arising from these matters but no assurance can be given that we will prevail in the arbitration if we do not prevail in the arbitration and the government requires additional remediation the costs of remediation could be significant 

  in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability and premises liability litigation we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages as estimated by our general counsel we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

  segments 

  our polymer additives segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas our catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas our fine chemicals segment is comprised of the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas effective january 1 2005 we revised the way we evaluate the performance of our segment results to reflect the manner in which the chief operating decision makers now review our three segments we now include the operating results of our joint ventures termed “equity in net income losses of unconsolidated investments” along with our operating profit which represents income before income taxes minority interests equity in net income losses of unconsolidated investments and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net and before interest and financing expenses and other income expenses net the change to segment income versus segment operating profit was brought about by the material effect of the refinery catalysts business joint ventures acquired in july 2004 on our consolidated operating results segment data continues to include intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses as well as allocations for certain corporate costs segment results including effective income tax rate calculations for years 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the revisions 

  in addition effective august 1 2005 we began consolidating our 50 ownership interest in jordan bromine company limited or jbc a jordanianamerican joint venture company that manufactures and markets bromine and bromine derivatives products from raw materials extracted from the dead sea we previously accounted for this investment on the equity basis however as a result of august 2005 amendments to the related joint venture agreement our management concluded that consolidation accounting for this investment was appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap this change in accounting has no impact on our net income segment results for the seven months ended july 31 2005 and years 2004 and 2003 were not restated for the impact of this change 

  other income expenses net 

  effective july 1 2005 we reclassified our minority ownership interest in stannica llc from “other income expenses net” to a separate disclosure line entitled “minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries” in the consolidated statements of income reclassifications have been made herein for years 2004 and 2003 totaling 51 million and 26 million respectively to reflect the change 

  the following is a discussion and analysis and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “financial condition and liquidity” on page 31 

overview and outlook 

  we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals our products and services enhance the value of our customers’ endproducts by improving performance providing essential product attributes lowering cost and simplifying processing we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers including manufacturers of consumer electronics building and construction materials automotive parts packaging pharmachemicals and agrichemicals and petroleum refiners we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise flexible lowcost global manufacturing base and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

  growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment new construction and increasingly stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of antipollution initiatives the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions 

2005 highlights 

refinery catalysts integration we focused on the integration of our new refinery catalysts business into our operations and culture our new catalysts segment represented approximately 35 of our 2005 net sales with one full year behind us we believe that this new segment is now fully integrated into our business model 

record safety and environmental performance we improved our safety performance by more than 15 in 2005 compared to 2004 in addition our manufacturing operations’ environmental performance improved over 25 

continued focus on cost savings we achieved our threeyear 500 million manufacturing cost savings goal primarily through workforce reductions plant cost reductions and raw material utilization reductions 

raw material headwinds we faced substantial increases in raw material and energy costs to offset these costs we worked diligently to avoid margin erosion by actively managing our supply chain increasing prices and implementing raw material surcharges for our products 

technology advances we continued to leverage our technological expertise by developing and introducing new products in 2005 sales from new products introduced in the last five years represented approximately 24 of our total net sales 

consolidation of jbc we consolidated this joint venture due to an amendment to the operating agreement 

decabrom exemption from rohs the european union exempted decabrom from its restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive after numerous scientific tests supported the heath safety of this flame retardant 

pension plan changes we announced plans to move away from a defined benefit pension plan for all employees beginning in 2011 all new employees are enrolled in a defined contribution plan 

debt reduction we reduced our total debt by over 1000 million lowering our debt to capitalization ratio to approximately 47 

increased dividends we increased our dividends for the 11 th consecutive year ending the year at an annual dividend rate of 064 per share 

2006 outlook 

  polymer additives polymer additives volumes were flat in 2005 after record growth in 2003 and 2004 we expect volumes in 2006 to meet or exceed those in 2005 we will continue our focus on restoring margins in this segment and will continue to drive price increases where warranted we announced 5 to 10 price increases for brominated flame retardants effective april 1 2006 and announced 12 mineral flame retardant increases effective the same date key raw materials needed to manufacture these products continue to rise forcing us to raise prices to offset these costs 

  we expect that our technology center in nanjing china will be operational in 2006 allowing us to provide polymer additives technical customer support in the asia pacific region we will also use this facility to repackage aluminum alkyls we believe that this location will provide us with solid footing in china to further expand our operations in this area 

  we will continue our efforts to educate manufacturers and the public about the safety and benefits of our flame retardants in early 2006 the us consumer product safety commission mandated flammability standards for mattresses that could support greater demand for the use of flame retardants depending on how manufacturers elect to flame retard their mattresses in addition various groups continue to evaluate the safety of brominated flame retardants and we intend to continue our support of sound scientific testing of these materials 

  catalysts  we expect hpc volumes to remain robust in 2006 as new diesel sulfur specifications go into effect midyear in addition as oil prices remain elevated refiners will use more sour crudes which will require hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities further driving demand for these catalysts we have begun construction on our new hpc plant at bayport texas which is expected to be operational in late 2006 this plant will add 10000 metric tons to our capacity 

  our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins by driving price increases to support the value these products bring to the market in 2005 we announced the first significant price increase for these catalysts in over ten years and will focus intently in 2006 on achieving these increases we believe that this 20 price increase along with announced surcharges will help offset the continuing raw material and energy costs to manufacture these catalysts and will allow margin recovery and expansion for this key catalyst 

  we are focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced highthroughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market 

  we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the rapidly growing gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets which remain viable as oil remains at historically high levels 

  fine chemicals we expect to continue the “turnaround” of our fine chemicals portfolio in 2006 we are implementing the announced shutdown of our seawater bromine facility in france and will continue evaluating other assets as we seek to improve the margins in this segment we are optimistic for the prospects of our single site plant in orangeburg south carolina that we recently converted into a multipurpose asset enabling us to take advantage of new products commercializing from our rd pipeline we will continue to explore other similar ways to profitably redeploy assets where possible 

  in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement our two strategic areas of focus in fine chemicals will be to maximize our bromine franchise value and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business our goal is to profitably grow our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets we will also continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last three years allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical innovators in diverse industries we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 

results of operations

  for 2004 our corporate and other expenses increased 95 million or 36 from 2003 this increase was due to higher employee incentive costs of 142 million which was offset in part by the impact of the absence of 2003 charges associated with the corporate allocation of a voluntary severance program of 28 million and a 25 million impairment charge on real estate held for sale 

  interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses for 2005 increased 246 million from 174 million in 2004 primarily due to a full year’s interest in 2005 on the debt outstanding that relates primarily to the july 2004 acquisition of the refinery catalysts business interest and financing expenses for 2004 increased 120 million from 54 million in 2003 due to higher average debt outstanding in 2004 related to the refinery catalysts business acquisition debt 

  other income expenses net other income expenses net for 2005 amounted to 15 million in income an increase of 137 million from 2004 the increase is due to the absence of the 2004 eurodenominated hedging losses of 128 million associated with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business in 2004 other income expenses net for 2004 amounted to expenses of 122 million an increase in expenses of 162 million from 2003 the increase is primarily attributable to eurodenominated hedging losses of 128 million associated with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business in 2004 and the absence of 27 million of interest income from an internal revenue service or irs income tax settlement in 2003 

  income taxes our income taxes for 2005 were 276 million an increase of 106 million or 62 from 2004 while income taxes for 2004 of 170 million increased 31 million or 22 from 2003 income taxes for 2005 benefited 56 million from the repatriation of overseas earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creaion act of 2004 known as the homeland investment act and 67 million from foreign tax credits related to repatriation of high taxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2005 we determined that certain of our reported income tax accounts were overstated based on our detailed reviews accordingly we recorded an income tax benefit of 76 million associated with the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to netherlands income tax rate changes in addition the deferred income tax account as recorded under accounting principles board or apb opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes – special areas” reflects an additional expense of 52 million related to the proper recording and identification of earnings and profits or ep adjustments in connection with acquired companies the net impact of these two adjustments amounting to an income tax benefit of 24 million did not have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 or any prior periods presented income taxes for 2004 benefited from 14 million related to the reversal of certain income tax reserves and the net favorable effect of 11 million in adjustments associated with the reconciliation of certain tax accounts income taxes for 2003 included the favorable benefit of 75 million related to the revaluation of reserve requirements as the irs closed audits related to tax years 1998 and 1999 as well as the impact of an income tax settlement with the irs related to tax years 1996 and 1997 received in the amount of 45 million the effective income tax rate for 2005 was 224 versus 235 in 2004 which was up from 151 in 2003 below is an explanation of the changes in effective income tax rates for the applicable years 

  minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries effective july 1 2005 we reclassified the minority ownership interest in stannica llc or stannica from “other income expenses net” to “minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries” or minority interests minority interests for 2005 includes the minority ownership charges for stannica for the full year and jbc for the five months beginning august 1 2005 reclassifications were made to minority interests for the minority ownership of stannica for the years 2004 and 2003 totaling 51 million and 26 million respectively to reflect the change

summary of critical accounting policies 

estimates and assumptions 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 

  allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables we also provide for claims receivables that are subject to legal proceedings 

  depreciation depreciation is computed primarily by the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets we have a policy where our internal engineering group provides asset life guidelines for book purposes these guidelines are reviewed against the economic life of the business for each project and asset life is determined as the lesser of the manufacturing life or the “business” life the engineering guidelines are reviewed periodically 

  inventory obsolescence inventories are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine age movement and turnover reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 

  recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

  acquisition accounting we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 

  income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

  legal accruals we estimate the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that we may incur with respect to litigation claims and assessments 

  performance and life cycle guarantees we provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees these guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered product must meet such as yield and product quality life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered product is guaranteed when either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated 

  environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing 1 the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter 2 the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and 3 the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

  actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

  we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 

claims receivable 

  we record receivables for nontrade claims on a casebycase basis whenever management deems that the claim for recovery is probable recording of such receivables is preceded by the gathering and evaluation of factually supportable evidence and conditions 

surrounding the claim and is generally based on application of specific contractual terms with third parties from which the claim arises in accordance with gaap we evaluate these receivables for collectibility on a regular basis and we record provisions for uncollectible amounts when subsequent conditions indicate that collection of all or part of the receivable is not probable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets no longer be amortized 

  we test goodwill for impairment using a twostep method by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving cash flows consistent with the objective of measuring fair value based on reasonable and supportive assumptions we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 

  definitelived intangible assets such as purchased technology patents customer lists and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to thirtyfive years we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets see note 8 “goodwill and other intangibles” 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

  we follow the guidance of sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards this delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans the primary assumptions are as follows 

discount rate —the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 

expected return on plan assets —we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets for these investments these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 

rate of compensation increase —for salaryrelated plans we project employees’ annual pay increases which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement 

rate of increase in the per capita of covered health care benefits —we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 

  during 2005 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

  in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to fixedincome security yields including high quality bonds moody’s aa and the international index company or iboxx aa corporate bond rates along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans the yield curve was produced for a universe containing usissued aagraded corporate bonds all of which were noncallable nonputable and nonsinkable for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments at december 31 2005 the weightedaverage discount rate was reduced for the plans from 549 to 544 as a result of decreased yields for longterm high quality bonds 

  in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2005 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from 836 to 831 and there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 700 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

  in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2005 and 2004 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 282 and 253 respectively for the pension plans 

  in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2005 the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was increased the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2005 for pre65 coverage was 9 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 while the trend rate for post65 coverage was 10 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2004 for pre65 coverage was 9 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the trend rate for post65 coverage was 11 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 for 2006 the trend rate for pre65 coverage is 9 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 the trend rate for post65 coverage is 10 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 5 the postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the netherlands who retire after august 2009 includes an assumed increase in benefits of 15 per year 

  the effect of a 1 increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the total service and interest components by 0043 million and would increase the benefit obligation by 0553 million a 1 decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the total service and interest components by 0057 million and would decrease the benefit obligation by 0714 million 

  a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions primarily in the united states 

income taxes 

  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts  we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter which result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income tax rules  we are subject to periodic audit of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the united states the internal revenue service has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year 1999 for the years after 1999 our income tax returns are either under review or could be subject to review 

  except as otherwise noted it is our policy to record deferred income tax liabilities on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested in those operations our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits or ep principles in general to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these ep amounts deferred taxes have not been recorded as they are essentially permanent in duration the determination of the amount of such unrecognized defered tax liability is not practicable 

  as further discussed in note 14 we have asserted that we are permanently reinvested with respect to earnings derived from our investment in jbc for all periods beginning after september 30 2005 

investments 

  we have investments in joint ventures nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities the majority of our investments are in joint ventures since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting significant influence is generally deemed to exist if 

we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 although other factors such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate our share of the investee’s earnings losses are included in the consolidated statement of income as “equity in net income losses of unconsolidated investments” it is also included in our computation of segment income investments in marketable securities are accounted for as both availableforsale securities with changes in fair value included in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and trading equities that are markedtomarket on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income joint ventures’ and nonmarketable securities’ results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 

internal control over financial reporting 

  section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 or sox 404 requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k filings our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp attests to our management’s assertion and provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we are required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” in part i item 9a 

  we have a dedicated sox 404 team in house to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews coordinate the process for these reviews provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting a steering committee comprised of personnel from finance and alliances services is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox 404 team status updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retain an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

  our sox 404 effort involves many of our employees around the world including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it is an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us even stronger 

financial condition and liquidity  

  our cash balance increased by 122 million to 586 million at december 31 2005 from 464 million at december 31 2004 for 2005 our continuing operations provided 1689 million of cash compared to providing cash of 1916 million in 2004 primarily due to increases in working capital as a result of operational growth of all of our operating segments cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of 780 million which consisted principally of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and common stock of 3247 million and 1479 million respectively funded longterm debt repayments of 7082 million and quarterly dividends to shareholders resulting in net cash used by financing activity of 692 million 

  working capital increased 781 million to 4517 million at december 31 2005 from 3737 million at december 31 2004 the increase in working capital is related to increased activity and is due primarily to an increase in cash accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 

  cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2004 were 464 million up 112 million from 352 million at yearend 2003 for 2004 cash flows provided from operating activities of 1916 million together with approximately 106 billion of proceeds from borrowings and 119 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options were used to cover operating activities make acquisitions totaling 7852 million net of cash acquired repay debt of 3414 million fund capital expenditures totaling 577 million pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of 253 million fund investments amounting to 129 million fund 128 million of realized eurodenominated hedging losses and pay 82 million of financing costs associated with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business purchase 27569 shares of our common stock and increase cash and cash equivalents by 112 million 

  we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our senior credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments 

  on october 13 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec covering 7000 million of securities the shelf registration will permit us to issue from time to time a range of securities including common stock preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt on january 20 2005 we completed the concurrent public offerings of 4488420 shares of our common stock of which an aggregate of 488420 shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald jr and certain affiliates of the family and 3250 million of 510 senior notes due 2015 we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these 

shares by the selling shareholders our portion of the common stock offering sale after the inclusion of 573000 overallotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters which was completed on january 28 2005 totaled 4573000 shares the shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of 3400 per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of 99897 of par we used the net proceeds from both offerings of 4698 million to repay the 4500 million 364day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business following the completion of the concurrent public offerings we had approximately 2200 million of securities available for issuance under the registration statement 

  the notes are our senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries 

  we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus 15 basis points plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 

  the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remain in breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 

  in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we entered into 1 a new senior credit agreement consisting of a 3000 million revolving credit facility and a 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility and 2 a 4500 million 364day loan agreement which we repaid with the net proceeds from our concurrent public offerings of shares of our common stock and senior notes 

  all of our borrowings in 2005 under the 3000 million revolving credit facility the 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility and 364day loan agreement bore interest at variable rates based on an average libor rate for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable rate currently 075  the applicable rate was variable based on the rating of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poors and moody’s as of december 31 2005 borrowings under the 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility bore a variable interest rate of 475 per annum as of december 31 2004 borrowings under the 3000 million revolving credit facility 4500 million fiveyear term loan facility and 364day loan agreement bore variable interest rates of 310 347 and 335 respectively per annum 

  borrowings under our senior credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following financial covenants a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined must be greater than or equal to 125100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter b consolidated debt to capitalization ratio as defined at the end of any fiscal quarter must be less than or equal to 60 c consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined must be or greater than or equal to 7500 million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states and d with the exception of liens specified in our new senior credit agreement liens may not attach to assets where the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens at any time exceeds 10 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreements at december 31 2005 our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was 193100 

  at december 31 2005 the noncurrent portion of our longterm debt amounted to 7759 million our longterm debt including the current portion and shortterm borrowings as a percentage of total capitalization amounted to 473 in addition we had the ability to borrow an additional 4360 million under our various credit arrangements 

  at december 31 2005 our foreign currency translation adjustments net of related deferred taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity on page 40 decreased from december 31 2004 primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 

  capital expenditures in 2005 of 701 million were higher than the 2004 level of 577 million our capital spending program in 2006 is expected to be approximately 1000 million with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales we expect our capital spending program to be approximately 800 to 900 million in 2007 and 2008 capital spending in 2006 for environmental and safety projects is expected to approximate that of 2005 which was somewhat higher than that in 2004 due to the increase in the number of manufacturing facilities we anticipate that future capital spending will be 

financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed if any provided by borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 

  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment unused letters of credit and various take or pay and throughput agreements 

capitalization 

  on january 20 2005 we completed the concurrent public offerings of 4488420 shares of our common stock of which an aggregate of 488420 shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald jr and certain affiliates of the family and 3250 million of 510 senior notes due 2015 we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders our portion of the common stock offering sale after the inclusion of 573000 overallotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters which was completed on january 28 2005 totaled 4573000 shares the shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of 3400 per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of 99897 of par we used the net proceeds from both of our offerings to repay the 4500 million 364day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

safety and environmental matters 

  we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

  among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party or prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases our participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

  our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately 306 million in 2005 versus approximately 295 million in 2004 and 237 million in 2003 excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2005 totaled approximately 289 million down 48 million from december 31 2004 

  we believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded if any should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period 

  capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 95 million 111 million and 97 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively for each of the next few years capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent regulatory requirements management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” or sfas no 151  sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handing costs and spoilage this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” which was the criterion specified in arb no 43 in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas no 151 is not expected to have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 

  in december 2004 fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” or sfas no 123r which supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” or apb no 25 and its related implementation guidance sfas no 123r will be effective as of the first annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 which to us will be march 31 2006 sfas no 123r will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense relating to our incentive plans this revision will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award we currently use the intrinsic value method from apb no 25 to measure compensation expense for stockbased awards to our employees under this standard we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our incentive plans under the new rules we are required to adopt a fairvaluebased method for measuring the compensation expense related to incentive stock awards the adoption of sfas no 123r is not expected to have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 

  in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” or fin 47 fin 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated fin 47 is effective no later than december 31 2005 we adopted fin 47 in 2005 without any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” or sfas no 154 sfas no 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fasb statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas no 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  in the normal course of operations we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of our business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and our ongoing manufacturing and funding activities as a result future earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of uncertain market conditions and we use both operational and financial market actions in our risk management activities which include the use of derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes we only enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments we do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings cash flows and fair values 

  shortterm exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies we cover certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 

  the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

  we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from timetotime of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of these contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 

  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which generally expire within one year in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income 

  our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of 001 million at december 31 2005 we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous 10 changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2005 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of 05 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of 06 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2005 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 

  in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price which was denominated in euros as a result we incurred a net charge of approximately 128 million during the year ended december 31 2004 

  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings at december 31 2005 of 4209 million bearing an average interest rate of 462  a change of 0125 in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 05 million we intend to use our senior credit agreement as the primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements which could expose us to changes in interest rates if various financial covenants are not met we manage our ratio of debttocapitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest cost of capital possible 

  our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements certain of which contain embedded derivatives to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 

  due to the increase in our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

  in 2004 we entered into treasury lock agreements or tlocks with a notional value of 2750 million to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85 of our january 2005 public offering of senior notes the tlocks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 425  the value of the tlocks resulted from the difference between 1 the yieldtomaturity of the 10year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and 2 the fixed rate of approximately 425  the cumulative loss effect of the tlock agreements was 22 million and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense at december 31 2005 there were unrealized losses of approximately 20 million 13 million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss that remain to be expensed 

  in addition certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market we purchase natural gas contracts when appropriate for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 

  our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 

  our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market the unrealized gains andor losses on them are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2005 there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding additionally any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate

acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

  

on july 31 2004 we acquired the refinery catalysts business of akzo nobel nv for approximately 763 million including expenses at applicable exchange rates pursuant to the terms of the international share and business sale agreement the sale agreement provides for a working capital adjustment based on the acquired business’ working capital on july 31 2004 as compared to a baseline working capital previously agreed upon by the parties in the fourth quarter of 2004 we adjusted the purchase price by approximately 23 million due primarily to a payment to akzo nobel as part of the postclosing working capital adjustments the purchase price allocation is not final at the time of this filing due to working capital and other contractual settlement issues with the seller as well as the establishment of final tangible and intangible asset values under review with third party valuation consultants however we do not expect the final purchase price accounting to differ materially from the amounts reported at december 31 2004 we expect the major elements of the purchase price allocation to be completed in the first quarter of 2005 with the exception of working capital and other contractual issues which are subject to final negotiation and settlement procedures pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement 

  

under the terms of the sale agreement we acquired two wholly owned subsidiaries of akzo nobel one in the united states and one in the netherlands sales marketing intellectual property and other assets used in the acquired business and 50 interests in three joint ventures fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa a brazilian joint venture nippon ketjen co ltd a japanese joint venture and eurecat sa a french joint venture with affiliates in the united states saudi arabia and italy as part of the acquisition we also agreed to assume the liabilities of the two acquired subsidiaries and certain liabilities of akzo nobel and its affiliates related to the acquired business we retained substantially all employees of the acquired business including all of the incumbent managers the sale agreement obligates akzo nobel to provide certain transition services to us for a period of up to one year following the completion of the acquisition the cost of these transition services was included in the acquisition purchase price 

  

business segments 

  

following the refinery catalysts business acquisition we transferred our existing polyolefin catalysts business from our polymer chemicals segment which we renamed polymer additives to a newly created catalysts segment which includes the assets we acquired from akzo nobel our operations are now managed and reported as three operating segments polymer additives catalysts and fine chemicals 

  

for financial information regarding our operating segments including revenues generated for each of the last three fiscal years from each of the product categories included in our operating segments and geographic areas see note 19 “operating segments and geographic area information” to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 beginning on page 38 

  

polymer additives 

  

our polymer additives segment consists of two product categories flame retardants and stabilizers and additives 

  

flame retardants our flame retardants help materials in a wide variety of finished products meet firesafety requirements some of the products that benefit from our flame retardants include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics printed circuit boards wire and cable electrical connectors foam seating in furniture and automobiles and textiles we compete in all the major flame retardant markets brominated mineral and phosphorus our brominated flame retardants include products such as saytex ® and pyrochek ®  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

our mineralbased flame retardants include products such as martinal ® and magnifin ® and our phosphorusbased flame retardants include products such as antiblaze ® and ncendx ®  our strategy is to have a broad range of chemistries applicable to each major flame retardant application although bromine products are the most costeffective option in many applications some customers require flame retardants that do not contain bromine or chlorine accordingly we acquired the mineralbased and phosphorusbased flame retardants businesses of martinswerk gmbh and rhodia sa 

  

stabilizers and additives we produce plastic and other additives such as curatives antioxidants and stabilizers which are often specially developed and formulated for a customer’s specific manufacturing requirements our plastic additives products include curatives for polyurethane and epoxy system polymerization as well as for ultraviolet curing of various inks and coatings this business also produces antioxidants and stabilizers to improve the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins 

  

our ethacure ® curatives are used in cast elastomers coatings reaction injection molding rim and specialty adhesives that are incorporated into products such as wheels tires and rollers our line of ethanox ® antioxidants is used by manufacturers of polyolefins to maintain physical properties during the manufacturing process including the color of the final product these antioxidants are found in applications such as slit film wire and cable food packaging and pipes 

  

we also produce antioxidants used in fuels and lubricants our line of hitec ® fuel and lubricant antioxidants are used by refiners and fuel marketers to extend fuel storage life and protect fuel systems and by oil marketers and lubricant manufacturers to extend the useful life of lubricating oils fluids and greases used in engines and various types of machinery 

  

major customer s 

  

the polymer additives segment offers more than 95 product groups to a variety of endmarkets we sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors such as polymer resin suppliers photographic companies and other specialty chemical companies as well as lubricant manufacturers and refiners 

  

sales of polymer additives are growing rapidly in asia due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the united states and europe to asia in response to this development we have established a sales and marketing network in china japan korea and singapore with products sourced from the united states europe and the middle east in addition we have a joint venture manufacturing site in china 

  

a number of customers of our polymer additives segment manufacture products for cyclical industries including the consumer electronics building and construction and automotive industries as a result demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical however because our polymer additives products are used in many different industries and for a wide variety of uses there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings except with respect to certain consumer electronicsrelated flame retardants 

  

competition 

  

the markets served by our polymer additives segment are highly competitive we invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services in order to compete effectively in the polymer additives marketplace 

  

competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers in endproducts in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries which has caused us to expand our product portfolio to include bromine phosphorus and mineral chemistries that are common in over 80 of end uses today for other additives competition is introduced by lowcost antioxidant suppliers we have begun to offer our basic products from lower cost sources and have pursued new blending technology to produce better more easily processed forms of antioxidant blends 

  

our most significant competitors in the brominated flame retardant business are great lakes chemical corporation and dead sea bromine group and our most significant competitor in the phosphorusbased flame retardant business is ripplewood holdings llc our major competitors in the mineralbased flame retardants business are almatis kyowa hakko kogyo co ltd and nabaltec gmbh our most significant competitor in the plastic additives business is ciba specialty chemicals 

  

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

  

the major raw materials we use in our polymer additives operations are bromine bisphenola and phenol caustic soda phosphorus oxychloride aluminum trihydrate polystyrene isobutylene and phosphorous derivatives most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

mitigate price volatility many of our customers operate under longterm supply contracts that provide for either the passthrough of raw material and energy cost changes or pricing based on shortterm “tenders” in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product 

  

the bromine we use in our polymer additives segment comes from our brine reserves in arkansas which are supported by an active brine rights leasing program we believe that we have in excess of 40 years of proven bromine reserves in arkansas in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company ltd a joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea 

  

our subsidiary martinswerk gmbh has certain contracts that require it to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate from its suppliers our annual requirements for aluminum trihydrate currently exceed these minimum purchase requirements we also entered into a range of phosphorus derivative supply agreements with rhodia sa as part of the acquisition of the rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business 

  

catalysts 

  

our catalysts segment includes refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts 

  

refinery catalysts our two main catalysts product lines are hydroprocessing or hpc catalysts and fluidized catalytic cracking or fcc catalysts and additives 

  

hpc catalysts are primarily used to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products fcc catalysts assist in the cracking of petroleum streams into derivative highervalue products such as gasoline diesel and raw material components we offer more than 90 different hpc catalysts products and more than 70 different fcc catalysts products to our customers 

  

polyolefin catalysts  we manufacture aluminum and magnesiumalkyls which are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins such as polypropylene and polyethylene used in plastic products elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates we also produce metallocenesinglesite catalysts which aid in the development and production of new polymers that increase impact strength clarity and melt characteristics of plastic films we are continuing to build on our organometallics base to expand the portfolio of products and capabilities we offer our customers and to pursue the development and commercialization of polymers based on metallocenesinglesite catalysts 

  

major customers 

  

the customers of our catalysts segment include multinational corporations such as exxonmobil corporation royal dutch petroleum company and chevrontexaco corporation independent petroleum refining companies such as valero energy corporation and tesoro petroleum corporation and national petroleum refining companies such as saudi aramco mobil refinery company ltd and petróleos mexicanos 

  

we estimate that there are currently approximately 455 fcc units being operated globally each of which requires a constant supply of fcc catalysts in addition we estimate that there are approximately 2000 hpc units being operated globally each of which typically requires replacement hpc catalysts once every one to three years we believe that our existing relationships with global petroleum refiners developed by our other business segments present opportunities to grow the market share of our new refinery catalysts business 

  

competition 

  

in the catalysts segment hpc and fcc catalysts competition is primarily from a select group of major catalysts companies our major competitors in the hpc catalysts market are criterion catalysts and technologies and wr grace  coadvanced refining technologies and our major competitors in the fcc catalysts market are wr grace  co and engelhard corporation some of the major catalysts companies have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction our major competitors in the polyolefin market include akzo nobel nv basell service company bv crompton corporation tosoh corporation univation technologies and wr grace  co 

  

we seek to enhance our competitive position by developing product and process improvements and specialized customer services through our research and development we endeavor to develop valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

raw materials 

  

the major raw materials we use in our catalysts operations include aluminum ethylene alpha olefins sodium silicate sodium aluminate kaolin molybdenum and cobalt carbonate most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to mitigate price volatility certain critical raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility for example molybdenum prices increased more than fourfold in 2004 our profitability may be reduced if we are unable to pass along such price increases to our customers 

  

fine chemicals 

  

our fine chemicals segment consists of four product categories performance chemicals pharmachemicals agrichemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates 

  

performance chemicals performance chemicals include products such as elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides and a number of bromine fine chemicals our products are used in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids paper manufacturing water purification glass manufacturing photography and various other industrial applications other performance chemicals that we produce include tertiary amines for surfactants and biocides and disinfectants and sanitizers potassium and chlorinebased products used in glass making and various other industrial applications alkenyl succinic anhydride used in papersizing formulations and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications we sell these products to customers throughout the world for use in personal care products automotive insulation foundry bricks and other industrial products 

  

pharmachemicals our bulk actives ibuprofen and naproxen are widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction bulk ibuprofen and naproxen are formulated by pharmaceutical companies for sale in both the prescription and overthecounter markets these products compete against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen we are one of the largest global producers of ibuprofen we also produce a range of intermediates used in the manufacture of a variety of overthecounter and prescription drugs 

  

agrichemicals our agrichemicals are sold to agrichemical manufacturers and distributors that produce and distribute finished agricultural herbicides insecticides fungicides and soil fumigants our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used with corn soybeans and other crops methyl bromide which is used as a soil fumigant and organophosphorus products which are used in the manufacture of insecticides we also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry 

  

in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1991 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer methyl bromide is injected into the soil by our customers before planting to eliminate bacteria soilborn pathogens nematodes fungus and weeds methyl bromide is used on highvalue crops such as strawberries tomatoes melons peppers and cut flowers 

  

current regulations allow us to continue to sell methyl bromide into our current markets through 2005 current regulations contemplate completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the united states western europe and japan in 2005 although certain aspects of the phaseout have been delayed under implementing regulations in these jurisdictions that permit the use of methyl bromide on a yeartoyear basis until a feasible alternative is available certain other markets for methyl bromide including quarantine and preshipment and chemical intermediate uses are not restricted by the montreal protocol 

  

fine chemistry services and intermediates in addition to supplying the specific fine chemical products and performance chemicals for the pharmaceutical and agricultural uses described above our fine chemistry services and intermediates or fcsi business offers custom manufacturing research and chemical scaleup services for downstream chemical and pharmaceutical companies we crosssell our fine chemistry services to our existing customers to whom we supply fine chemical products and performance chemicals while also offering fine chemistry services and intermediates to others in the fcsi markets we believe that these services position us to support customers in developing their new products such as new drugs 

  

major customers 

  

the fine chemicals segment manufactures more than 120 product groups which are used in a variety of endmarkets sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors including pharmaceutical agricultural drilling water treatment and photographic companies and to other specialty chemical companies 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

pricing for many of our fine chemicals is based upon negotiation with customers the critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer’s developmental process 

  

competition 

  

competition in the fine chemicals segment is intense and varies within each of our different product groups in the brominebased products groups we primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers great lakes chemical corporation and dead sea bromine group in the pharmaceutical bulk actives product groups  ie  ibuprofen and naproxen we primarily compete with a few major western competitors such as basf corporation however there is increasing competition from asian sources we are seeking to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new innovative products offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer 

  

raw materials 

  

the major raw materials we use in our fine chemicals operations include potassium chloride chlorine ammonia aluminum chloride alpha olefins methyl amines and propylene most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers 

  

the bromine that we use in our fine chemicals segment comes from two primary sources arkansas and jordan the arkansas brine reserves are supported by an active brine rights leasing program where we believe that we have in excess of 40 years of proven bromine reserves in addition through our 50 interest in jordan bromine company ltd a joint venture with operations in safi jordan we produce bromine from the dead sea 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

we have an international strategic account program that uses crossfunctional teams to serve large global customers this program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating value for customers and promoting postsale service we also use more than 50 selected distributors commissioned sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas some of which are subsidiaries of large chemical companies 

  

research and development 

  

we believe that in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must continually invest in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development we continue to seek increased margins by introducing valueadded products and processes based on proprietary technologies 

  

our research and development efforts support each of our business segments the focus of research in polymer additives is divided among new and improved flame retardants plastic and other additives and blends and curing agents flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants and improving existing flame retardants to meet higher performance requirements required by today’s polymer producers formulators and original equipment manufacturers plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and value added plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations 

  

catalysts research is focused on the needs of both our refinery catalysts customers and our polyolefin catalysts customers refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products in the polyolefin area we are focused primarily on developing catalysts cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems to polymer producers to meet the market’s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers 

  

the primary focus of our fine chemicals research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries another area of research is the development of biocides for industrial and recreational water treatment and other applications especially products based on bromine chemistry 

  

we spent 313 million 184 million and 165 million in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 2 “accounting for research and development costs” in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively on research and development total research and development department spending was 399 million 292 million and 264 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

intellectual property 

  

our intellectual property including our patents licenses and trademarks is an important component of our business as of december 31 2004 we owned approximately 1600 active us and foreign patents and had over 1000 pending us and foreign patent applications in addition in connection with the refinery catalysts business acquisition we obtained 50 interests in three joint ventures each of which has its own intellectual property portfolio in addition we have acquired rights under the patents and inventions of others through licenses and license our patents and inventions to third parties 

  

regulation 

  

our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations including those under the occupational safety and health act or osha we also are subject to similar state laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations for our nonus operations we devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees we maintain an active health safety and environmental program we finished 2004 with a record low ohsa recordable injury rateillness rate of 044 additionally we set a new record for consecutive days without a recordable injury of 180 days over the past 10 years we have consistently achieved an osha recordable injury incidence rate in the top 20 of all chemical companies who are members of the american chemistry council 

  

our business and our customers also may be subject to significant new regulations under the european commission’s registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals or reach proposal as proposed reach would impose obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports including testing data on each chemical substance perform chemical safety assessments and obtain premarket authorization with respect to certain substances of particularly high concern while it is uncertain whether when and in what form the reach proposal will become law the proposed new regulations would impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers and importers and to a lesser extent downstream users of chemical substances and preparations our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union would likely require us to incur significant additional compliance costs including the hiring of additional employees to coordinate the additional reporting requirements and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us key aspects of our operations are subject to them and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them 

  

liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of or exposure to such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property we are subject to such laws including the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla or superfund in the united states and similar foreign and state laws our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and based on information currently available to it has concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not be material to operations 

  

we record accruals for environmental matters in accordance with the guidelines of the aicpa statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated future developments including developments affecting contractual indemnification rights we believe we have as well as contractual or other obligations that we may have and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures we cannot assure you that as a result of former current or future operations there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities see “safety and environmental matters” in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 26

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

on april 2 2004 albemarle overseas development company a wholly owned subsidiary of our company initiated a request for arbitration against aventis sa through the international chamber of commerce international court of arbitration paris france the dispute arises out of a 1992 stock purchase agreement between a predecessor to albemarle overseas development and a predecessor to aventis under which 100 of the stock of potasse et produits chimiques sa now known as albemarle ppc was acquired by albemarle overseas development the dispute relates to a chemical facility in thann france owned by albemarle ppc under the terms of the agreement we believe that aventis is obligated to indemnify albemarle overseas development and albemarle ppc and hold them harmless from certain claims losses damages costs or any other present or prospective liabilities arising out of soil and groundwater contamination at the site in thann 

  

beginning in may 2000 the french government with respect to the management of pollution risk on the site of active industrial installations required albemarle ppc to conduct an environmental risk study of the thann facility in june 2002 the french government directed albemarle ppc to undertake a more detailed risk study of groundwater contamination the administrative process of the french government is still ongoing as of the present date albemarle overseas development has demanded indemnification from aventis for the cost of the studies but aventis has refused to pay 

  

the request for arbitration requests indemnification of albemarle overseas development by aventis for all costs incurred by albemarle ppc in connection with any environmental claims of the french government for the albemarle ppc facility and a declaratory judgment as to the liability of aventis under the agreement for costs to be incurred in the future by albemarle ppc in connection with such claims arbitration related to the question of liability is currently scheduled for june 2005 

  

at this time it is not possible to predict what the french government will require with respect to the thann facility since this matter is in its initial stages and environmental matters are subject to many uncertainties we believe however that we are entitled to be fully indemnified by aventis for all liabilities arising from this matter but no assurance can be given that we will prevail in this matter if we do not prevail in the arbitration and the government requires additional remediation the costs of remediation could be significant 

  

on june 4 2004 we initiated a petition for breach of contract and declaratory judgment against amerisure insurance company and amerisure mutual insurance company fka michigan mutual insurance company in the nineteenth judicial district court parish of baton rouge louisiana on the grounds of the defendants’ refusal to honor their respective obligations under certain insurance policies on which we were named an additional insured to reimburse us for certain damages incurred by us in the discontinuance of product support for and the withdrawal from a water treatment venture this proceeding has been removed to united states district court for the middle district of louisiana where it is currently pending we have also initiated formal discussions related to such damages with our primary general commercial liability carrier no assurance can be given that we will prevail in this matter 

  

in addition we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws such as superfund products liability and premises liability litigation we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages as estimated by our general counsel we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

overview 

  

we are a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of highlyengineered specialty chemicals our products and services enhance the value of our customers’ endproducts by improving performance providing essential product attributes lowering cost and simplifying processing we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers including manufacturers of consumer electronics building and construction materials automotive parts packaging pharmachemicals and agrichemicals and petroleum refiners we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity technical expertise flexible lowcost global manufacturing base and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 

  

growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment new construction and increasingly stringent firesafety regulations in many countries around the world growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of antipollution initiatives the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research product development and manufacturing functions 

  

acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

  

on july 31 2004 we acquired the refinery catalysts business of akzo nobel nv for approximately 763 million including expenses at applicable exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2004 we adjusted the purchase price by approximately 23 million due primarily to a payment to akzo nobel as part of the postclosing working capital adjustments we believe that this acquisition significantly enhances our business by giving us a strong new operating segment following this acquisition we transferred our 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

existing polyolefin catalysts business from our polymer chemicals segment which we renamed polymer additives to a newly created catalysts segment which also includes the assets we acquired from akzo nobel our operations are now managed and reported as three operating segments polymer additives catalysts and fine chemicals 

  

under the terms of the sale agreement we acquired two wholly owned subsidiaries of akzo nobel one in the united states and one in the netherlands sales marketing intellectual property and other assets used in the acquired business and 50 interests in three different joint ventures fábrica carioca de catalisadores sa a brazilian joint venture nippon ketjen co ltd a japanese joint venture and eurecat sa a french joint venture with affiliates in the united states saudi arabia and italy as part of the acquisition we also agreed to assume the liabilities of the two acquired subsidiaries and certain liabilities of akzo nobel and its affiliates related to the acquired business we retained substantially all employees of the acquired business including all of the incumbent managers 

  

the sale agreement provides for a working capital adjustment based on the acquired business’ working capital on july 31 2004 as compared to a baseline working capital previously agreed upon by the parties in the fourth quarter of 2004 we adjusted the purchase price by approximately 23 million due primarily to a payment to akzo nobel as part of the postclosing working capital adjustments the purchase price allocation is not final at the time of this filing due to working capital and other contractual settlement issues with the seller as well as the establishment of final tangible and intangible asset values under review with third party valuation consultants however we do not expect the final purchase price accounting to differ materially from the amounts reported at december 31 2004 we expect the major elements of the purchase price allocation to be completed in the first quarter of 2005 with the exception of working capital and other contractual issues which are subject to final negotiation and settlement procedures pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement 

  

in connection with the acquisition we entered into 1 a new senior credit agreement consisting of a 300 million revolving credit facility and a 450 million fiveyear term loan facility and 2 a 450 million 364day loan agreement we used the initial borrowings under the new senior credit agreement and the 364day loan agreement to consummate the acquisition refinance our thenexisting credit agreement and pay related fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith 

  

public offerings of common stock and senior notes 

  

on january 14 2005 we announced concurrent public offerings of 4488420 shares of its common stock and 325 million of senior notes the common stock offering sale after the inclusion of 573000 overallotment shares requested and sold by the company’s underwriters totaled 5061420 shares of which an aggregate of 488420 shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald jr and certain affiliates of the family we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders both offerings closed on january 20 2005 with a common stock sale price of 3400 per share and the sale of 325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the senior notes offering at the public offering price of 99897 of par we used the net proceeds from both offerings of 4698 million to repay the 450 million 364day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

  

outlook 

  

the 2004 refinery catalysts business acquisition was a significant event in our tenyear history the refinery catalysts business adds a number of foundation technologies to our portfolio including hpc catalysts and fcc catalysts as well as new products targeting the fast growing clean fuels catalysts market we expect that sales from innovative products such as these will contribute to our ability to turnover our portfolio of sales from new products roughly every five years 

  

in 2005 successful execution of our price increase strategies across the majority of our businesses will remain a key focus we expect continued pressure from raw material costs in 2005 particularly in bisphenola ethylene olefins chlorine and caustic and metals including molybdenum nickel and cobalt based upon the full year 2005 forecast we expect that our raw materials costs will increase approximately 40 to 50 million compared to 2004 business fundamentals are strong which should lead to solid cash flow and strong earnings with increases due in part to our success in increasing prices during the last half of 2004 however we are closely watching leading indicators in the electronics market for signs of a slowdown which could impact the extent of margin recovery 

  

in 2002 we launched a threeyear 50 million manufacturing cost reduction program to reduce our fixed cost base as of fourth quarter 2004 we achieved an annual run rate on savings equivalent to 37 million this program is being expanded to include our newly acquired facilities 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

with the successful completion of the common stock and notes offerings in january 2005 we substantially reduced our debt to capital rate and set interest costs by repaying the 450 million 364day loan at year’s end our debt to capital rate was approximately 57 and after the common stock and notes offerings our debt to equity ratio has been reduced to approximately 50 we intend to use future free cash flow to continue to reduce debt targeting a 45 debt to capital rate over the next twelve months we will continue to drive our business to generate cash and to further strengthen the balance sheet 

  

on december 16 2004 bp announced that it will close its linear alpha olefins plant in pasadena texas by the end of december 2005 according to bp effective february 28 2006 it will terminate certain operating and service agreements pursuant to which we provide operating and support services and certain utilities to bp and bp provides operating and support services and certain utilities to us at our facilities in pasadena texas for the year ended december 31 2004 these agreements resulted in net payments to us from bp of approximately 27264 we are currently negotiating with bp regarding the terms of the termination in addition we are working internally to develop a plan to mitigate the impact of the termination of these agreements 

  

polymer additives 

  

polymer additives experienced the eighth straight quarter of record net sales as a result of continued strong demand in our key markets with an average growth of approximately 6 per quarter our critical areas of focus will be in driving operating margin improvement executing development business growth plans in china increasing global flame retardant advocacy and continuing success in our new product development portfolio unless market demand materially declines we expect to continue our fouryear growth trend with yearoveryear increases in 2005 

  

catalysts 

  

during 2005 we expect to realize underlying growth in shipments of refinery catalysts and will continue our efforts to improve margins to offset increased raw material cost fcc catalysts volumes are expected to experience some temporary softening in early 2005 due to seasonal refinery turnarounds but we may begin to see an impact in the first quarter from our announced price increases we are seeing good demand for hpc catalysts in the first quarter despite the higher prices resulting from raw material inflation there are early indications that prices for molybdenum a key raw material may stabilize as we combine our current polyolefin catalysts business with the acquired refinery catalysts business we forecast that the catalysts segment will add more than 35 to our legacy net sales level on an annual basis in 2005 

  

the major global petroleum refineries continue to prepare for stricter fuel specifications including the upcoming onroad diesel sulfur specifications that will be implemented in 2006 these stricter specifications are leading to new capital expenditures by petroleum refineries to expand hydroprocessing capability while increasing overall demand for high performance catalysts the recently announced opening of a specialty zeolite facility in our pasadena texas complex which produces a full range of hydrotreating and fcc additives will allow us to utilize an innovative new process to address the increasing demand for additives that enhance light olefins production and the growing use of gasoline posttreatment for sulfur reduction 

  

fine chemicals 

  

during 2005 we expect to see increasingly high asset utilizations and margin improvement in the bromine products area critical areas of focus in this segment will continue to be fueling new product growth in life sciences and maximizing our longterm bromine franchise value new product sales increased 14 in 2004 and we expect this trend to continue in 2005 the impact of exiting the detergent zeolite business is now fully behind us 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we completed construction of a new chlorine production unit as part of our jordan bromine company jbc joint venture bromine production plant this facility which is expected to have an annual capacity of approximately 25000 metric tons should serve to lower raw materials costs and contribute to improved profitability for the venture in 2005

summary of critical accounting policies 

  

estimates and assumptions 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables we also provide for claims receivables that are subject to legal proceedings 

  

depreciation book depreciation is estimated based upon internal engineering studies which are conducted periodically engineering and manufacturing with the advice of specific product management review each project to make sure that assets to be capitalized are depreciated based upon the estimated product life andor individual asset life whichever is less 

  

inventory obsolescence inventories are viewed on a quarterly basis to determine age movement and turnover reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

recovery of longlived assets we evaluate the recovery of our longlived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

  

acquisition accounting we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 

  

income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

  

legal accruals we estimate the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that we may incur with respect to litigation claims and assessments 

  

performance and life cycle guarantees we provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees these guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered catalysts must meet such as yield and product quality life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered catalysts is guaranteed when either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated 

  

environmental remediation liabilities we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing 1 the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter 2 the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and 3 the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

  

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements our standard terms of delivery are included in our contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 

  

claims receivable 

  

we record receivables for nontrade claims on a casebycase basis whenever management deems that the claim for recovery is probable recording of such receivables is preceded by the gathering and evaluation of factually supportable evidence and conditions surrounding the claim and is generally based on application of specific contractual terms with third parties from which the claim arises in accordance with us gaap we evaluate these receivables for collectibility on a regular basis and we record provisions for uncollectible amounts when subsequent conditions indicate that collection of all or part of the receivable is not probable 

  

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

  

we follow the guidance of sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards this delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans the primary assumptions are as follows 

  

   

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

   

   

during 2004 we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 

  

in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to fixedincome security yields specifically high quality bonds moody’s aa corporate bond rate at december 31 2004 the weightedaverage discount rate was reduced for the plans from 608 to 549 as a result of decreased yields for longterm high quality bonds 

  

in estimating the expected return on plan assets we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2004 the weightedaverage expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from 873 to 835 and there was no change in the weightedaverage expected 700 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets our us defined benefit plan for nonrepresented employees was closed to new participants effective march 31 2004 we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march 31 2004 

  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2004 and 2003 the assumed weightedaverage rate of compensation increase was 253 and 254 respectively for the plans 

  

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2004 the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was decreased the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2004 for pre65 coverage was 9 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the trend rate for post65 coverage was 11 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2003 for pre65 coverage was 10 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the trend rate for post65 coverage was 12 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the netherlands who retire after august 2009 includes an assumed increase in benefits of 2 per year 

  

income taxes 

  

deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes using the liability or balance sheet method such temporary differences result primarily from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse we are subject to periodic audit of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the united states the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year 1999 for the years after 1999 the our income tax returns are either under review or could be subject to review by the irs 

  

in connection with our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 at december 31 2004 we determined that certain of our reported income tax accounts were overstated based on our detailed reviews net adjustments to reflect the reviews resulted in an increase in our net income of approximately 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 additionally we determined nonprofit and lossrelated differences in our taxable income calculations for certain of our past income tax returns relating mainly to depreciation adjustments recorded for purposes of determining taxable income these differences which amounted to approximately 94 million in deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31 2004 were apportioned between current income tax payable approximately 35 million and deferred income tax liabilities we believe that the increase in our net income of approximately 11 million and this reclassification entry has had an immaterial impact on our reported financial position 

  

investments 

  

we have investments in joint ventures nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities the majority of our investments are in joint ventures since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

these joint ventures they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 although other factors such as representation on the investee’s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate our shares of the investee’s earnings losses are included in the consolidated statement of income as “equity in unconsolidated investments” investments in marketable securities are accounted for as both availableforsale securities with changes in fair value included in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and trading equities that are markedtomarket on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income joint ventures’ and nonmarketable securities’ results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 

  

internal control over financial reporting 

  

section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 “sox 404” requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our 2004 annual report on form 10k our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp must attest to management’s assertion and provide its assessment on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in order to make our assertion we were required to identify material financial and operational processes document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls see “report of independent registered public accounting firm” in part i item 8 and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” part i item 9a 

  

we began preparing for our sox 404 initiative prior to january 1 2004 we formed a sox 404 team to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews coordinate the process for these reviews provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting we formed a steering committee comprised of personnel from finance and alliances services to set uniform guiding principles and policies review the progress of the initiative direct the efforts of the sox 404 team and update the audit committee of the board of directors on an ongoing basis we also retained an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 404 

  

the sox 404 effort involved many of our employees around the world including participation by the business areas and alliance services we viewed this evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise—it was an opportunity to assess critically the financial control environment and make it even stronger we incurred initial costs associated with our sox 404 initiative in 2004 and expect to incur costs in the future particularly as we coordinate the sox 404 evaluation with other regulatory requirements to review and evaluate the control environment 

  

management excluded the refinery catalysts business acquired from akzo nobel nv from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 because such business was acquired on july 31 2004 by us in a material purchase business combination the refinery catalysts business’ total assets and total revenues represent approximately 24 and 12 respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2004

we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our new senior credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses satisfy debt service obligations fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments 

  

on january 14 2005 we announced concurrent public offerings of 4488420 shares of our common stock and 325 million of senior notes the common stock offering sale after the inclusion of 573000 overallotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters totaled 5061420 shares of which an aggregate of 488420 shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald jr and certain affiliates of the family we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders both offerings closed on january 20 2005 with a common stock sale price of 3400 per share and the sale of 325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the senior notes offering at the public offering price of 99897 of par we used the net proceeds from both offerings of 4698 million to repay the 450 million 364day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with its acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

  

all of our borrowings under the 300 million revolving credit facility 450 million fiveyear term loan facility and 364day loan agreement bear interest at variable rates based on an average libor rate for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable rate currently 10 the applicable rate is variable based on the rating of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poors and moody’s as of december 31 2004 borrowings under the 300 million revolving credit facility 450 million fiveyear term loan facility and 364day loan agreement bore variable interest rates of 310 347 and 335 respectively per annum

at december 31 2004 our foreign currency translation adjustments net of related deferred taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity on page 40 increased from december 31 2003 primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro

our 510 senior notes due 2015 the offerings resulted in aggregate net proceeds of 4698 million we used the net proceeds from these offering to retire all of the indebtedness that we incurred under our 364day loan agreement to finance our acquisition of akzo nobel’s refinery catalysts business we used the remaining net proceeds from the offerings remaining for general corporate purposes including debt reduction as a result the amount outstanding under the 364day loan at december 31 2004 450000 has been classified as longterm debt in addition 325000 of this amount has been reflected in the debt maturities as due in 2015 consistent with the senior notes maturity date and the difference of 125000 has been reflected in the debt maturities as due in 2005 because the proceeds from the stock issuance in january 2005 were used to pay down this amount 

  

the notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding the notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness our subsidiaries 

  

we may redeem the notes before their maturity in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or 2 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the notes plus 15 basis points plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 

  

the principal amount of the notes become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 of the notes upon the occurrence of an event of default events of default include among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times failure to perform or remain in breach of covenants within prescribed periods an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain of our subsidiaries of 400 million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries

capitalization 

  

on january 20 2005 we completed the concurrent public offerings of 4488420 shares of our common stock of which an aggregate of 488420 shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald jr and certain affiliates of the family and 325 million of senior notes albemarle did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders our portion of the common stock offering sale after the inclusion of 573000 overallotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters totaled 4573000 shares both offerings closed on january 20 2005 with a common stock sale price of 3400 per share and the sale of 325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the senior notes offering at the public offering price of 99897 of par we used the net proceeds from both of our offerings to repay the 450 million 364day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 

  

presented below are three views of our capitalization as of december 31 2004 1 on an actual basis 2 on a pro forma basis adjusted to give effect to the sale of the 4573000 shares of our common stock sold at a public offering price of 3400 per share and

the application of the net proceeds and 3 on a pro forma basis further adjusted to give effect to the sale of 325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the senior notes offering at the public offering price of 99897 of par and the application of the net proceeds 

  

   

   

safety and environmental matters 

  

we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to our knowledge we are currently complying and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

  

among other environmental requirements we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases our participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled in de minimis situations our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

  

our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately 277 million in 2004 versus approximately 226 million in 2003 and 198 million in 2002 excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2004 totaled approximately 337 million up 46 million from december 31 2003 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

we believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded if any should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period 

  

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 110 million 97 million and 64 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively for each of the next few years capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent regulatory requirements management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 151 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handing costs and spoilage this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” which was the criterion specified in arb no 43 in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas no 151 will not have an effect on us 

  

in december 2004 fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas no 123r which supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance sfas no 123r will be effective as of the beginning of our 2005 third quarter which begins after the effective date of june 15 2005 sfas no 123r will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense relating to our incentive plans the amount at adoption is not expected to be significant this revision will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award we currently use the intrinsic value method from apb no 25 to measure compensation expense for stockbased awards to our employees under this standard we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants for issues under our incentive plans under the new rules we are required to adopt a fairvaluebased method for measuring the compensation expense related to incentive stock awards 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion 29 “sfas no 153”  this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 this statement amends apb 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange the adoption of sfas no 153 is not expected to have an effect on us 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position sfas 1091 application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 “fsp sfas 1091” and fasb staff position sfas 1092 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004 “fsp sfas 1092” the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” was signed into law on october 22 2004 the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010 in return the act also provides for a twoyear phase out of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion “eti” for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in a significant impact on the effective tax rate for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 based on current earnings levels in the longterm we expect that the new deduction will result in an increase of the annual effective tax rate by one percentagepoint based on current earnings levels in the years 20072009 with a return to near current tax levels in 2010 however due to the complexity of the act we have entered into contractual arrangements with an external resource to evaluate the overall impact of the act on our earnings forecast under the guidance in fsp sfas 1091 the deduction will be treated as a “special deduction” as described in sfas no 109 as such the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date rather the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return the act also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and as of today uncertainty remains as to how to interpret 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

numerous provisions in the act we are evaluating whether we can take advantage of this onetime benefit offered for repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and have no basis at this time for projecting any benefits 

  

risk factors 

  

you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information including the financial information contained in this annual report on form 10k 

  

our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 

  

in 2004 our raw material and energy costs increased approximately 27 and approximately 4 respectively compared to 2003 raw material costs and energy costs have continued to increase in 2005 the increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil chlorine and metals including molybdenum which is used in the refinery catalysts business we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 

  

in addition to raising prices raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

  

we face competition from other specialty chemical companies which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 

  

we operate in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers competition is based on several key criteria including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do as a result these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions additionally competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices which could affect our margins and profitability adversely our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position we could lose market share to our competitors 

  

downturns in our customers’ cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  

downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales many of our customers are in industries including the electronics building and construction and automotive industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions historically downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices and we may experience similar problems in the future a decline in economic conditions in our customers’ cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

  

our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 

  

our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced on average once every one to three years the sales of our hpc catalysts therefore are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on environmental conditions such as droughts which may prevent farming for extended periods 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

changes in our customers’ products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 

  

our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products for example many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price performance or other considerations we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements consequently it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use our business results of operations cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 

  

our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 

  

the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive we must successfully develop manufacture and market new or improved products as a result we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues additionally for any new product program there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs moreover new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 

  

we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products for example the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from largescale producers of pharmachemicals particularly from asian sources in our catalysts segment our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities including sulfur as a result our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined as new products enter the market our products may become obsolete or competitors’ products may be marketed more effectively than our products if we fail to develop new products maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

  

our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

protection of our proprietary processes methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business we generally rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights the patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies additionally some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and even if a patent application has been filed it may not result in an issued patent if patents are issued to us those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

  

we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes to redesign our products partially or completely to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

  

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states we and our joint ventures currently have 25 production facilities research and development facilities and administrative and sales offices located outside the united states including facilities and offices located in austria belgium brazil france germany italy japan jordan the netherlands the people’s republic of china saudi arabia and the united kingdom we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures accordingly our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent in international operations include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition certain of our joint ventures operate in highrisk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america unanticipated events such as geopolitical changes could result in a writedown of our investment in the affected joint venture our success as a global business will depend in part upon our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions by developing implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 

  

we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro japanese yen and british pound sterling exchange rates 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currencydenominated debt outstanding in addition to currency translation risks we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

  

we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

  

in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 

  

violations of environmental health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 

  

if we violate environmental health and safety laws or regulations in addition to being required to correct such violations we can be held liable in administrative civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances as well as personal injury property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved or even the entire loss such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue including for example entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property as well as entities that currently own or operate such property such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict we use and in the past have used hazardous substances at many of our facilities and we have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material we also have generated and continue to generate hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate the nature of our business including historical operations at our current and former facilities exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production storage use transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

  

contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 

  

at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators however in the event we make a claim the indemnifier may disagree with us in 2004 we commenced an arbitration proceeding against aventis sa concerning its obligations with respect to contamination at our thann france facility after aventis refused to accept our demands for indemnification under the contract pursuant to which we acquired the facility if those who currently or in the future disagree with us about the scope of their indemnity obligations prevail in their interpretation our accrual andor our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 

  

concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 

  

we manufacture a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups for example for many years we have produced methyl bromide a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant in recent years the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly driven by the montreal protocol of 1991 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical’s potential to deplete the ozone layer the current regulations contemplate completion of the phaseout of methyl bromide as a fumigant in 2005 although certain aspects of the phaseout have 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

been delayed under implementing regulations that permit the use of methyl bromide on a yeartoyear basis until a feasible alternative is available 

  

in addition there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers or pbdes which are used as flame retardants in light of concerns about their potential impacts on human health and the environment we manufacture decabrompde a type of pbde compound in 2004 our net sales of decabrompde were less than 4 of total net sales government regulation if it occurs or studies evaluating the possibility of regulation even if governmental regulation does not occur may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrompde 

  

we also manufacture naproxen a bulk active widely used to provide temporary pain relief and fever reduction recently an alzheimer’s disease prevention trial being conducted by an arm of the us national institutes of health found that patients taking naproxen had a greater incidence of cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke than patients taking a placebo in 2004 our net sales of naproxen were less than 1 of total net sales 

  

we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 

  

our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because in certain instances we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to react to changes in our industry or to implement our strategic initiatives 

  

in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we entered into 1 a new senior credit agreement consisting of a 300 million revolving credit facility and a 450 million fiveyear term loan facility and 2 a 450 million 364day loan agreement we used the initial borrowings under the senior credit agreement and the 364day loan agreement to consummate the acquisition refinance our thenexisting credit agreement and pay fees and expenses in connection therewith in addition on january 20 2005 we completed the public offering of 325 million aggregate principal amount of our 510 senior notes due 2015 we used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering together with the net proceeds from a concurrent public offering of 4573000 shares of our common stock to retire all of the indebtedness outstanding under our 364day loan agreement as of february 28 2005 we had total indebtedness of 8351 million and we had also guaranteed 352 million of indebtedness incurred by certain of our joint ventures 

  

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you for example it could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

   

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of the senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes do not prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify 

  

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside our control based on an average interest rate of 405 at february 28 2005 and outstanding borrowings at that date of 8351 million our annual interest expense would be 338 million a change of 0125 in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately 1 million our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all if we are unable to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or raise additional equity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 

  

our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility the failure to comply with the covenants in the senior credit agreement the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness including indebtedness incurred in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 

  

borrowings under our senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and moody’s investors services “moody’s” sp has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as bbb and moody’s has rated our senior unsecured longterm debt as baa3 sp andor moody’s may in the future downgrade our ratings the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement in addition the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

  

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing storage handling and transportation including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime transportation interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination in addition the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals accordingly these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties 

  

the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 

  

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered we may incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies including liabilities for environmental remediation in addition from time to time various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

commercially acceptable terms or in some cases have not been available at all in the future we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

  

we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate the refinery catalysts business or future acquisitions into our business which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 

  

as part of our business growth strategy we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources including available cash and borrowing capacity the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses furthermore we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 

  

as described under “business—acquisition of the refinery catalysts business” we acquired the refinery catalysts business on july 31 2004 successful integration of this business is important to our future 

  

the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are not required to assess the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting of the refinery catalysts business until fiscal 2005 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules of the sec promulgated thereunder require issuer annual reports to contain a report of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and an attestation of the issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm as to that management report the first management internal controls report as well as the first auditor attestation of that report is included in this annual report form 10k the sec has clarified that the staff will not object if management’s section 404 report does not cover the internal controls of companies or businesses acquired during the fiscal year of the report where it is not possible for management to conduct a timely assessment following the consummation of the acquisition based on the staff’s position we excluded the refinery catalysts business from our section 404 certification for 2004 therefore we will not be required to determine the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the refinery catalysts business until we complete our assessment for fiscal 2005

we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 

  

we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner based on our assessments we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 

  

if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business in addition because of the specialized and technical nature of our business our future performance is dependent on the continued service of and on our ability to attract and retain qualified management scientific technical marketing and support personnel competition for such personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

  

some of our employees are unionized represented by workers’ councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 3700 employees approximately 21 of our 2100 us employees are unionized two of our collective bargaining agreements expire in 2005 and one expires in 2007 in addition a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements for example most of our employees in europe are represented by workers’ councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment including salaries and benefits and staff changes and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees a strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 

  

our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 

  

we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan in that case our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture also differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

although our pension plans are currently adequately funded events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 

  

we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world including in the united states the netherlands germany japan and belgium covering most of our employees the us plans represent approximately 80 of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries 

  

during 2004 we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately 128 funded on an irs funding basis as of december 31 2004 and as a result there are no required cash contributions to the plans in 2005 however the actual amount of contributions made subsequent to 2004 will 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

depend upon asset returns thencurrent interest rates and a number of other factors the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly specifically if yearend accumulated obligations exceed assets we may elect to make a voluntary contribution over and above the minimum required in order to avoid additional minimum liability charges to our balance sheet and consequent reductions to shareholders’ equity these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 

  

the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 

  

chemicalrelated assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world as an acc member company we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard we have a corporate security standard and audits our facilities for compliance recent investments have been made to upgrade site security however federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities which may increase our overhead expenses 

  

new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 

  

the occurrence of extraordinary events including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage in addition available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or if available may be prohibitively expensive

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

in the normal course of operations we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and our ongoing manufacturing and funding activities as a result future earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of uncertain market conditions and we use both operational and financial market actions in our risk management activities which include the use of derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes we only enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments we do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings cash flows and fair values 

  

shortterm exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies we cover certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 

  

the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

  

we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from timetotime of foreign currency forward contracts the principal objective of these contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with global operating activities we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which generally expire within one year in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions the primary method to 

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures in the event a natural hedge is not available a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income 

  

in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price which was denominated in euros as a result we incurred a net charge of approximately 128 million during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2004 no such contracts were outstanding 

  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities we intend to use our senior credit agreement as the primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements which could expose us to changes in interest rates if various financial covenants are not met we manage our ratio of debttocapitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest cost of capital possible 

  

our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors historically we have not used futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements certain of which contain embedded derivatives to provide longterm protection against changes in metals prices we seek to limit our exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 

  

due to the increase in our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business we may enter into interest rate swaps collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we entered into treasury lock agreements “tlocks” with a notional value of 275 million to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85 of our january 2005 325 million notes offering the tlocks have fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 425 the value of the tlocks will depend on the difference between 1 the yieldtomaturity of the 10year us treasury security that has the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes when issued and 2 the fixed rate of approximately 425 the cumulative effect of the tlock agreements currently forecasted to be a charge of 2 million will be amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the interest expense of the notes at december 31 2004 there were unrealized losses of approximately 07 million 04 million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

  

our operations are exposed to market risk from changes in natural gas prices we purchase natural gas to meet our production requirements for a portion of our 12month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements by entering into natural gas futures contracts to help mitigate uncertainty and volatility 

  

our hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 

  

the natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 and are marked to market the unrealized gains andor losses are deferred and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2004 there were unrealized losses of approximately 05 million 03 million after income taxes any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings

polymer chemicals the polymer chemicals operating segment consists of a broad range of chemicals including flame retardants catalysts and polymer additives 

albemarle’s brominated mineralbased and phosphorus flame retardants are manufactured to help materials meet firesafety requirements in finished products that serve a variety of enduse markets including electronic enclosures wire and cable printed circuit boards electrical connectors construction and textiles 

the company’s catalyst business is the world’s largest manufacturer and marketer of aluminum alkyls that are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates the company continues to build on its organometallics base and expand the portfolio of products and capabilities it offers its customers pursuing the development and commercialization of polymers based on metallocenesinglesite catalysts 

albemarle also produces polymer additives such as curatives for polyurethane and epoxy system polymerization as well as for ultraviolet curing of various inks and coatings antioxidants and alkylated hindered phenolics are produced to maintain the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins 

  

fine chemicals the fine chemicals operating segment includes a broad range of chemicals including pharmachemicals agrichemicals fine chemistry services and intermediates and performance chemicals 

  

the company’s bulk actives ibuprofen and naproxen are widely used to provide fever reduction and temporary pain relief bulk ibuprofen and naproxen are formulated by pharmaceutical companies who sell to customers in both the prescription and overthecounter markets ibuprofen and naproxenbased products accounted for approximately 31 and 6 of the us overthecounter analgesic market in 2003 on a volume basis respectively these products compete against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen the company is one of the world’s largest producers of ibuprofen 

the company’s agrichemicals are sold to chemical companies that supply finished products to farmers governments and others these products include orthoalkylated anilines for the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used on corn soybeans and other crops methyl bromide used as a soil fumigant and organophosphorus products used as an insecticide methyl bromide one of the company’s products is regulated based on the montreal protocol of 1991 and the subsequent phaseout amendment in the epa clean air act

does not believe it has significant assets in countries in which those assets would be deemed to be exposed to substantial risk see item ii properties and note 18 “operating segments and geographic area information” of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 on page 46 

  

competition 

albemarle operates in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of other companies in most of its product lines in recent years albemarle has experienced increased competition from companies in asia and india competition is based on several key criteria dependent upon the product area including product performance and quality product price product availability and security of supply product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 

to remain competitive the company invests in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development the company continues to introduce valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies the company’s ability to compete will be dictated by its expertise and willingness to respond to the varied needs of industry through selective investment in its flexible manufacturing centers and through adaptations in current facilities to make new products these capabilities fit well with albemarle’s process technology background 

in the polymer chemicals arena competition can come from different polymers being substituted for use in end products in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities for flame retardants competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries and albemarle has expanded its product portfolio to include bromine mineral and phosphorus chemistries that are common in over 80 of end uses today for catalysts and additives competition is introduced by lowcost suppliers in antioxidants and other commoditylike products and by new methods of polymer production the company has begun to offer its basic products from lower cost sources and has pursued new blending technology to produce better more easily processed forms of antioxidant blends albemarle has been a leader in developing singlesite catalysts to assist major polymer producers in altering the properties of polymers to meet market needs 

in the fine chemicals segment there is increasing competition from largescale generic pharmaceutical products particularly from asian and indian sources the company is developing products for pharmaceuticals at early stages well prior to the phase where the product will be marketed generically in order to develop relationships and processes that may provide an opportunity to produce the larger quantities needed for patient sales initial successes in this area are promising while there are few physical barriers to entry in this approach albemarle’s reputation for research expertise and its strong history of developing process technology are important components in generating new opportunities for the company 

  

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

raw materials used by the company include potassium chloride bisphenola chlorine ethylene caustic soda aluminum trihydrate alpha olefins as well as electricity and natural gas as fuels most of which are readily available from numerous suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices the company believes are competitive the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools as appropriate to offset shortterm price fluctuations 

the company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves supported by an active brine rights leasing program in addition the company through its interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” produces bromine from extensive brine reserves in the dead sea evaporation pan system this bromine is used in derivative plants in jordan and in various regions in the world particularly in asia 

the company’s subsidiary martinswerk gmbh “martinswerk” has certain contracts that require martinswerk to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate from its suppliers the company also entered into a range of phosphorus intermediate supply agreements with rhodia sa and certain of its affiliated companies “rhodia” as part of the acquisition of the rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business 

  

major customers 

due to the diversity of product lines in which albemarle competes no major portion of overall sales or earnings was generated by one customer nor is the company overly reliant on contracts with any one public private or governmental entity although loss of one or more major customers could have a substantial financial impact 

a number of the company’s customers manufacture products for cyclical industries such as the agricultural pharmaceutical automotive electronics and building and construction industries as a result demand for the products of the company from customers in such industries also is cyclical however due to the diversity and size of the company’s operations there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings except for certain agricultural and pharmaceutical products and certain electronicsrelated

overview and outlook 

as albemarle enters 2004 the company is well positioned to further expand and diversify operations in 2003 revenue increased by 10 up 102 million from 2002 driven by our acquisitions favorable foreign exchange movement and the development and expansion of our base business this momentum is expected to continue in 2004 however the growth is expected to be moderated due to continued margin pressure and the maturation of selected products albemarle is in a strong financial position to capture new opportunities and further build our diversified global platform 

we expect to continue to strengthen our global platform through organic growth and acquisitions about 27 of our 2003 sales originated from businesses we acquired within the past five years these acquisitions were strategically aligned to support our product portfolio and were accretive to earnings within a year we continue to look for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives 

during 2004 we plan to provide resources to fuel the continuing research and development essential for growth new products developed within the past five years now account for almost 15 of net sales up from 12 in 2002 this past success has prompted a reevaluation of our earlier goal of 15 which may be increased to 20 of our portfolio by 2006 

our research programs not only include development of new products but also extend to the introduction of efficient process technology to support our manufacturing expertise our history in organometallic and bromine chemistry provides the foundation to serve new polymer pharmaceutical and other product areas we expect new 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

opportunities to result from the combination of our technical expertise coupled with our global marketing and distribution new developments include innovative brominebased products for use in water treatment catalysts for the next generation of ultrathin ultraclear ultrastrong polyolefin films and intermediates that support promising advances in drug delivery systems 

albemarle continues to grow geographically expanding our footprint in key growth regions of the world through acquisitions joint ventures new distribution channels and other methods in asia we have recently formed and launched our trading company to support growth in china and although our starting point is relatively low we have seen an 80 increase in chinese sales in 2003 versus 2002 further we are in the process of starting up our jointventure polyolefins catalyst plant near shanghai in january of 2004 we acquired a distribution and marketing company in korea providing direct access to many important customers in the region it is our belief that sales into asia will grow at a faster rate than other parts of the world 

the search for growth across a wide front is critical in recent years chemical industry earnings have been pinched between low demand caused by a worldwide economic slump and increasing raw material and energy prices for example our raw material and energy costs were up over 24 million compared to 2002 it is difficult to forecast the level and direction of pricing trends in raw materials and energy but we do see a continued bias toward higher costs in these areas as the economic recovery continues 

the company frequently reviews the impact of key raw materials and energy costs on our business and reports on their impact excluding any costs passed through to our customers ethylene increases of one cent per pound impact earnings per share “eps” by one and onehalf cents on an annual basis similarly chlorine increases of 10 per ton lower eps by two cents and a change in the price of alumina trihydrate of 10 per ton change eps by about seven cents natural gas increases of 1 per million btus reduce earnings about 10 cents per share including the impact on electricity costs all of these costs are calculated before taxes 

for many years we have faced everincreasing competition from asian manufacturers this trend is expected to continue our margins have been affected by more aggressive global competition and when this is combined with price pressures related to the slow economic recovery in the us manufacturing sector it is easy to see the need for a relentless pursuit of cost control and innovation we have also experienced the loss of key customers for certain of our products albemarle will continue the systematic construction of a global lowcost portfolio based on new technology—both internally developed and acquired—and serving our customers well this is the key to our future performance as we seek to realign our activities to these global changes 

as we enter 2004 the strength of the economy is one of the primary drivers of our business particularly as it relates to growth in consumer electronics and construction two important enduse markets for polymer chemicals this business is also expected to be positively influenced by a combination of internal development cost improvements and bolton acquisitions 

we also are monitoring closely the financial and competitive impact of foreign exchange movements overall the recent weakening of the united states dollar is positive for the company but this volatility always has sequential ramifications and the impact can change over time based on the 2003 sales mix albemarle has calculated the impact on net sales of movement in exchange rates of the dollar against significant sales currencies for the company a movement of 1 in the japanese yen will affect dollar sales figures by about 700000 on an annual basis the european union’s euro’s fluctuation of 1 against the dollar will change albemarle sales by about 3 million on an annual basis 

  

fine chemicals 

our fine chemicals business is expected to be influenced by many of the same factors in 2004 as in 2003 raw material and energy cost issues and the continued decline of certain product volumes in the us 

on the positive side we expect continued improvement in our inorganic bromine business where albemarle has attained a strong global position 

our brominebased products are now integrated back to key raw materials in two major regions of the world which gives us the flexibility to serve customers from arkansas in the united states or safi in jordan in addition the many fine chemicals that have bromine as a component are being developed and supplemented by our research and development teams in the us europe and asia and we expect to continue to benefit from the focus on bromine compounds with a secondhalf rise in demand for bromine in 2003 we were able to increase prices for some of our products this is a very positive sign for 2004 should the broader economic recovery continue 

our jordan bromine company joint venture on the dead sea continues to perform above expectations this venture will provide the company with low cost raw materials and derivatives for many years serving as an important geographic base to support albemarle’s sales into europe and asia also the december 2003 acquisition of the atofina bromine chemicals business will provide an enhanced manufacturing base and additional products 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

the other key growth element in fine chemicals is the investment we are making in the development of potential new products many in conjunction with major pharmaceutical firms we have evolved our own strategy to focus earlier in the process particularly on pharmaceuticals and we have found strong interest among a growing list of customers as evidenced by inquiries and quotes offered for our services we now have a pipeline of over 80 new opportunities in precommercial products while there is no guarantee that any of these products have commercial viability our experience suggests that these efforts will drive much of our organic growth 

this development pipeline provides albemarle with several channels to participate in different points of a product life cycle and creates opportunities to manufacture the next generation of largevolume products the company’s contract research laboratory scaleup and flexible manufacturing capabilities provide the infrastructure to produce highvalue niche products in our pipeline 

in addition to general economic pressures shipments of certain fine chemicals segment products such as methyl bromide and other agricultural chemicals are expected to decline over the next few years based on regulatory decisions that impact the marketing life or distribution reach of these products for example methyl bromide a soil fumigant is scheduled to be phased out of use in the united states by the beginning of 2005 except for critical uses and other limited exemptions there are efforts underway to postpone the phase out based on the lack of available substitutes in the market in addition in january 2004 our zeolites unit serving the us domestic detergent builders industry was idled the company is evaluating alternative uses for this asset 

the increasing strength of asian competitors most directly affects the fine chemicals segment particularly in the larger quantity generic pharmaceutical products just as the company has done in the united states we are seeking to combat these competitive issues through increased marketing efforts product enhancements cost control sourcing initiatives and joint ventures these competitive pressures are not new issues to the company or the chemical industry but it is often difficult to predict the impact on our customers 

  

polymer chemicals 

the polymer chemicals segment is expected to continue strong growth due to favorable economic conditions a broad product range and a series of strategic acquisitions over the past few years in 2003 two of the company’s three acquisitions involved the polymer chemicals segment 

  

in the catalysts and additives area the new fuel and lube antioxidants business brought in approximately 23 million in annual net sales to the albemarle portfolio the new phosphorus flame retardant business with sales of about 55 million annually was added in july the two lines were quickly integrated into the company’s portfolio and both are expected to achieve the goal of being accretive to earnings within one year of their purchase 

in the second half of 2003 catalysts and curatives volumes improved reflecting strength in downstream polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene and other related plastics markets overall flame retardant volumes were up at doubledigit levels compared to the corresponding period in 2002 pricing for flame retardants held steady for the year versus the prior year strong volume trends in polymer chemicals may indicate overall economic improvement and there are signs the trend could continue into 2004 

in light of the improving economic environment we completed construction of a tetrabrom flame retardant production unit in jordan and provided qualification samples to many european and asian customers capacity in this unit is about 12000 metric tons and the successful startup in jordan gives albemarle through its joint venture substantial flexibility in meeting customer needs around the world 

also the acquisition of the phosphorus flame retardant business added a third critical technology to albemarle’s flame retardant line our bromine mineral and phosphorus based products provide us with the ability to offer a variety of solutions to our flame retardant customers and solidifies our strategy to become the premier fullservice flame retardant company 

we continue to look for acquisitions in the polymer chemicals segment that provide a strategic and financial fit 

  

corporate 

our drive to expand our global business platform is supported by a strong balance sheet and cash flow during 2003 the cash flow from operations provided the fuel for 118 million in acquisitions 53 million of new capital including joint ventures 18 million of stock repurchases and 26 million dividends paid we continue to have adequate financial headroom to pursue acquisitions and are positioned to raise additional funding if the need arises 

the outlook for 2004 is to follow similar themes—growthoriented expenditures for acquisitions and capital dividend payments and selective stock repurchases when warranted 

our pension plan is well funded with pension assets of 406 million at the end of 2003up from 334 million at the start of the year we have been able to take advantage of good stock and bond market performance during 2003 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

we also have taken steps to reduce our future pension liability by closing the defined pension benefit plan to new employees in the united states beginning in april 2004 new employees will have the opportunity to participate in a defined contribution plan 

management continues to exercise control over costs in all areas and expects to increase funding for research and development as administrative costs are diminished in other areas there is significant activity around improving and streamlining our transaction capabilities through the formation of an alliance services group within the company as one example of the benefits of this program we were able to generate orders from albemarle systems within 18 hours of the closing of one recent acquisition in europe 

we have continued to evaluate many acquisition opportunities brought to the market as the industry continues to restructure while we will consider equity dilution for larger acquisitions we are steadfast in our focus on adding value this approach results in conservative valuations for possible acquisitions and an intention to preserve a strong balance sheet our dedication to creating wealth for our shareholders is a constant 

in summary as albemarle enters the next decade we believe the company is well positioned to grow and create additional value for our shareholders the company has the underlying technologies products and organization to participate in the everchanging global chemical industry the company has put in place strategies to grow the business and control costs and believes there is an equal balance between the positive developments within the company and the external forces that moderate growth and profitability

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company estimates losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 

depreciation — book depreciation is estimated based upon internal engineering studies which are conducted periodically engineering and manufacturing with the advice of specific product management review each project to make sure that assets to be capitalized are depreciated based upon the estimated product life andor individual asset life whichever is less 

inventory obsolescence — inventories are viewed on a monthly basis to determine age movement and turnover reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value

revenue recognition 

sales are recognized when the revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition in financial statements” net sales are recognized as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer which usually occurs at the time shipment is made the majority of the company’s sales are sold fob “free on board” shipping point or on an equivalent basis other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements albemarle’s standard terms of delivery are included in its contracts of sale order confirmation documents and invoices revenue from services is recognized when performance of the services has been completed the company has a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 

  

  

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

the company follows the guidance of sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards this delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans the primary assumptions are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

during 2003 the company made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for salaryrelated plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits the company consults with actuaries when selecting each of these assumptions 

in selecting the discount rate consideration is given to fixedincome security yields specifically high quality bonds moody’s aa corporate bond rate at december 31 2003 the discount rate was reduced for the plans from 660 to 615 as a result of decreased yields for longterm high quality bonds 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected longterm allocation of plan assets to these investments at december 31 2003 the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from 925 to 875 and there was no change in the expected 700 return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

in projecting the rate of compensation increase the company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates at december 31 2003 the assumed rate of compensation increase was reduced from 375 to 256 for the plans 

in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits the company considers past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends at december 31 2003 the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was decreased the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2003 for pre65 coverage was 10 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the trend rate for post65 coverage was 12 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2002 for pre65 coverage was 11 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 the trend rate for post65 coverage was 13 per year dropping by 1 per year to an ultimate rate of 6 

  

income taxes 

deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes using the liability or balance sheet method such temporary differences result primarily from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 

  

investments 

the company has investments in joint ventures nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities the majority of the company’s investments are in joint ventures since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting the company’s shares of the investee’s earnings losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of “other income net including minority interest” investments in marketable securities are accounted for as availableforsale securities with changes in fair value included in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets joint ventures’ and nonmarketable securities’ results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis

cash flows provided from operating activities which rose for the third straight year amounted to 1501 million together with 1196 million of proceeds from borrowings from credit agreements 44 million of proceeds from the liquidation of a nonmarketable security and 126 million of existing cash and cash equivalents were used to cover operating activities in 2003 make three acquisitions totaling 1178 million see other matters on page 4 for details of the acquisitions repay debt of 837 million fund capital expenditures and investments in joint ventures and nonmarketable securities of 411 million and 120 million respectively pay dividends to common shareholders of 232 million and purchase approximately 700000 shares of the company’s common stock for 176 million 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2002 were 478 million which represented an increase of 172 million from 306 million at yearend 2001 

for 2002 cash flows provided from operating activities were 1448 million which together with 2813 million of proceeds from borrowings primarily from the company’s primary credit agreements and an increase in working capital of approximately 71 million excluding foreign currency translation were used to cover operating activities in 2002 payoff the company’s previous revolving credit facility of 160 million cover repayment of debt of 1026 million purchase approximately 4 million shares of the company’s common stock for 931 million fund capital expenditures of 384 million pay dividends to common shareholders of 230 million and increase cash and cash equivalents by 172 million 

the company anticipates that cash provided from operating activities in the future will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses debt service obligations dividend payments to common shareholders and to fund most if not all of its capital expenditures 

the company has a threeyear unsecured credit agreement dated september 10 2002 with a group of lenders providing for 375 million in revolving credit facilities the “credit agreement” borrowings under the company’s credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following financial covenants a consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined must be greater than or equal to 300100 b consolidated leverage ratio as defined must be less than or equal to 350100 c consolidated tangible domestic assets as defined must be equal to or greater than 750 million for the company to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states d with the exception of liens specified in the credit agreement liens may not attach to assets with a value of more than 10 of consolidated net worth as defined in the agreement as of december 31 2003 the company was in compliance with 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

these covenants an increase in pricing level for outstanding interest rates and commitment fees which are based on the company’s debttocapitalization ratio would not accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness thereunder however an increase in our debttocapitalization ratio would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under the credit agreement 

in addition at december 31 2003 the company had the flexibility to borrow up to a total of 837 million 246 million outstanding at december 31 2003 under its various other credit arrangements 

the noncurrent portion of the company’s longterm debt amounted to 2284 million at december 31 2003 compared to 1903 million at the end of 2002 at december 31 2003 and 2002 the company had the ability to refinance its borrowings through credit lines with domestic financial institutions and foreign banks with borrowings under its credit agreement which matures on september 10 2005 

the company’s total longterm debt including the current portion as a percentage of total capitalization at december 31 2003 was approximately 264 in addition the company has commitments in the form of guarantees for 50 of the loan amounts outstanding which at december 31 2003 amounted to 283 million of its 50owned joint venture company jbc jbc entered into the loans in 2000 to finance construction of certain bromine and derivatives manufacturing facilities on the dead sea the company’s total loan guarantee commitment for jbc is 50 of the jbc’s total loans which could amount to 46 million if jbc makes all of its allowable draws 

at december 31 2003 the company’s foreign currency translation adjustments net of related deferred taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity on page 21 increased from december 31 2002 primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 

capital expenditures in 2003 of 411 million were higher than the 2002 level of 384 million the company’s capital spending program is expected to be in the 5060 million range over the next few years with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be slightly more in 2004 than the current year future capital spending is expected to be financed primarily with cash provided from operating activities with the balance if necessary provided by additional debt the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions of facilities andor businesses particularly in areas where its knowhow adds value 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment unused letters of credit and various take or pay and throughput agreements 

  

   

environmental matters 

the company is subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to the company’s knowledge it is currently complying and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances compliance with existing federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 

among other environmental requirements the company is subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases the company’s participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

many cases settled in de minimis situations the company’s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters the company’s records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

the company’s environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately 21 million in 2003 versus approximately 177 million in 2002 and 144 million in 2001 excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2003 totaled approximately 291 million down 23 million from december 31 2002 

the company believes that most of the amount it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded if any should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects for the company including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 45 million 44 million and 26 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively for each of the next few years capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent regulatory requirements management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of operations the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and the company’s ongoing manufacturing and funding activities as a result future earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk the company has established policies procedures and internal processes governing its management of uncertain market conditions and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities which include the use of derivative instruments the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings cash flows and fair values 

shortterm exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 

the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 

the company’s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of less than 001 million at december 31 2003 the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous 10 changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2003 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of 04 million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of 05 million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2003 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages the worldwide exposure of its interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through its regular operations and financing activities the company utilizes a credit agreement as its primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements which could expose the company to changes in interest rates if various financial covenants are not met the company manages its ratio of debttocapitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest interest rate possible a hypothetical change of 100 basis points in the company’s effective interest rate on its variable interest rate longterm debt at december 31 2003 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately 23 million 

raw materials used by the company are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors the company does not use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however management seeks to limit its exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available and seeks price increase limitations through contracts 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in natural gas prices related to its production requirements during 2003 the company began entering into natural gas futures contracts “contracts” of upto 50 of its 12 month rolling forecast of its north american consumption to help manage its exposure the contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas 133 and are marked to market the unrealized gains andor losses are deferred and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction at december 31 2003 there were unrealized gains of approximately 008 million 005 million after tax in accumulated other comprehensive income any unrealized gains andor losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings

the company produces the majority of its products in the united states but also has production facilities in france germany and the united kingdom and has aluminum alkyls produced for it by bp plc or its affiliates “bp” at the company’s former feluy belgium plant the processes and technologies for many of these products were developed in the company’s or its predecessor’s ethyl corporation “ethyl” research and development laboratories the company also has interests in certain joint venture production facilities in japan people’s republic of china jordan and austria 

the company’s worldwide chemicals operations are reported as two separate and distinct operating segments polymer chemicals and fine chemicals 

the polymer chemicals’ operating segment consists of a broad range of chemicals including flame retardants catalysts and polymer additives 

albemarle’s brominated mineralbased and phosphorus flame retardants are manufactured to help polymer materials meet firesafety requirements in finished products which serve a variety of end use markets including electronic enclosures wire and cable printed circuit boards electrical connectors and construction 

the company’s catalyst business is the world’s largest supplier of aluminum alkyls which are used as cocatalysts in the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene elastomers alpha olefins such as hexene octene and decene and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates the company has production units at pasadena texas orangeburg south carolina baton rouge louisiana feluy belgium which is leased to bp and a 50owned joint venture in japan the company has continued to build on its organometallics base and expand the portfolio of products and capabilities it offers its customers pursuing the development and commercialization of polymers based on metallocenesinglesite catalysts 

the company also produces polymer additives such as curatives for polyurethane and epoxy system polymerization as well as for ultraviolet curing of various inks and coatings which are products used to control polyurethane and epoxy system polymerization also produced are antioxidants and alkylated hindered phenolics that are used to maintain the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins 

the fine chemicals’ operating segment includes pharmachemicals agrichemicals fine chemistry services and intermediates and performance chemicals included in performance chemicals are elemental bromine alkyl bromides inorganic bromides and a number of bromine fine chemicals applications for these brominebased performance chemicals primarily exist in chemical synthesis oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids water purification glass making cleaning products and photographic chemicals the company continues to expand its bromine production capabilities completing the bromine and bromine derivative facilities in safi jordan with joint venture partner arab potash company limited in late 2002 the jordan joint venture capacities will supplement the company’s current and extensive brine field bromine and bromine derivatives at the magnolia arkansas facilities other performance chemicals products include tertiary amines for surfactants and biocides disinfectants and sanitizers potassium and chlorinebased products used in glass making and various other industrial applications zeolite a sodium alumina silicate used as a phosphate replacement in laundry detergent builders alkenyl succinic anhydride asa used in papersizing formulations urea formaldehyde resins used in coating applications and aluminum oxides used in a wide variety of refractory ceramic and polishing applications these products have many varied customers they are sold to suppliers for use in household institutional and industrial cleaners personal care products coatings automotive insulators foundry bricks and other industrial products 

the company’s pharmachemicals bulk actives ibuprofen and naproxen are widely used to provide fever reduction and temporary relief of aches and pains and menstrual cramps bulk ibuprofen and naproxen are formulated by pharmaceutical companies who sell to customers in both

the prescription and overthecounter markets ibuprofen and naproxenbased products accounted for approximately 31 and 8 of the us overthecounter analgesic market in 2002 on a volume basis respectively they compete against other painkillers including aspirin and acetaminophen the company is one of the world’s largest producers of ibuprofen albemarle produces pharmaceutical intermediates at several plant sites subsidiary albemarle ppc sas “appc” operates a plant in thann france which produces more than thirty different intermediates used in the production of pharmaceutical actives and intermediates the intermediates produced at this facility are primarily but not exclusively brominated products the company’s cgmp pilot plant in dayton ohio produces pharmaceutical intermediates for a wide array of potential drugs under clinical trial 

the dayton ohio facility the pilot plant at the tyrone pennsylvania facility the process development center in baton rouge louisiana and the plant in thann france form the capability base for the company’s contract research and custom manufacturing businesses these business areas provide research and scaleup services primarily to innovative life science companies the flexible custom manufacturing capabilities of the commercial units at the tyrone pennsylvania plant are well suited for the scaleup of many of these and other product offerings the later stages of these products can be standardized in tyrone or be targeted for manufacturing in one of the company’s dedicated production sites this breadth of scaleup capability across a variety of sites positions albemarle to access new fine chemicals opportunities in the life sciences and other major end markets 

the company’s agrichemicals are sold to chemical companies that supply finished products to farmers governments and others these products include orthoalkylated anilines for the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides used on corn soybeans and other crops methyl bromide with its primarily use as a soil fumigant and organophosphorus products for insecticide use the company is in year two of a fiveyear environmental protection agency “epa” program to phase down the home use of certain endmarket products that use albemarle’s organophosphorus agrichemical intermediates in addition methyl bromide is regulated based on the montreal protocol of 1991 and the subsequent phaseout amendment in the epa clean air act 

appc is one of the world’s largest producers of organic and inorganic brominated compounds used mainly in pharmaceutical photographic and agricultural chemical intermediates appc also operates an electrolysis unit to produce highpurity caustic potash and potassium carbo nate used in the glass water treatment cleaning product and food industries appc strengthens the company’s position in fine chemicals and provides additional manufacturing capabilities in europe 

in the fine chemicals’ product lines most plants operated at similar rates to those experienced in 2001 with the largest exception being the magnolia arkansas brominebased performance chemicals’ facilities which have improved to near full utilization in 2002 

in polymer chemicals’ product lines most of the company’s plants operated at somewhat higher capacity utilization in 2002 than during 2001 however the aluminum alkyls plants operated at rates below those in 2001 

the company operates on a worldwide basis with i manufacturing plants located in france germany and the united kingdom in addition to facilities in the united states and has interest in certain joint venture production facilities in japan people’s republic of china jordan and austria ii offices and distribution terminals in belgium france japan and singapore as well as the united states and iii offices in shanghai and beijing china the company does not believe it has significant assets in countries in which those assets would be deemed to be exposed to substantial risk see note 17 “operating segments and geographic area information” of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 on page 39 

  

competition 

albemarle operates in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a number of other companies in most of its product lines some markets involve a significant number of competitors while others involve only a few the competitors of the company are varied in terms of size resources and market share competition generally is based on product performance and availability reputation for quality price and customer service and support the degree and nature of competition depends on the type of product involved 

in general the company competes on the basis of the quality and price of its products and customer services by maintaining a broad range of products and by focusing resources on products in which the company has a competitive advantage it endeavors to improve its reputation for quality products competitive prices and excellent customer service and support competition in connection with the company’s products requires continuing investments in research and development product and process improvements and specialized customer services through research and development the company continues to seek to increase margins by introducing valueadded products and products based on proprietary technologies

raw materials and significant supply contracts 

raw materials used by the company include ethylene potassium chloride aluminum orthotoluidine bisphenola chlorine phenol isobutylene caustic soda toluene diphenyl oxide alumina trihydrate dimethlyamine phthalic anhydride polystyrene alpha olefins maleic anhydride ethanol phosphorus sulfuric acid and nitrogen as well as electricity and natural gas as fuels most of which are readily available from numerous suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices the company believes are competitive 

the company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves supported by an active leasing program the company has supply agreements with the dead sea bromine group of companies the contracts essentially cover the bromine requirements for the production of bromine fine chemicals for thann in addition the company through its interest in jordan bromine company limited “jbc” produces bromine from extensive brine reserves in the dead sea evaporation pan system this bromine is supplied to part of the company’s european operations and to derivative plants in jordan 

the company’s subsidiary martinswerk gmbh “martinswerk” has certain contracts which require martinswerk to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate from its suppliers this is expected to continue as the company or its subsidiaries expect to continue or expand purchases of aluminum trihydrate 

  

major customers 

due to the diversity of product lines in which albemarle competes no major portion of overall sales or earnings was generated by one customer nor is the company overly reliant on contracts with any one public private or governmental entity although loss of one or more major customers could have a substantial financial impact 

a number of the company’s customers manufacture products for cyclical industries such as the agricultural pharmaceutical automotive electronics and building and construction industries as a result demand for the products of the company from customers in such industries also is cyclical however due to the diversity and size of the company’s operations there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings except for certain agricultural and pharmaceutical products and certain electronicsrelated flame retardants in addition the profitability of sales of certain products depends on the level of industry growth and our plant capacity utilization 

  

other matters

results of operations 

net sales by operating segments for the three years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

   

net sales 

net sales for 2002 grew to 9802 million up 633 million 69 from 9169 million in 2001 polymer chemicals’ net sales in 2002 were up 645 million 140 due to higher shipments 461 million partially offset by lower pricing 157 million in flame retardants and the increase in net sales of 297 million resulting from the may 31 2001 acquisition of martinswerk gmbh “martinswerk” and higher shipments 69 million offset in part by lower pricing 25 million in catalysts and additives fine chemicals’ net sales in 2002 were down 12 million 03 primarily due to lower shipments in agrichemicals and fine chemistry services 291 million product mix in performance chemicals 61 million offset in part by the company’s midyear 2001 acquisitions of martinswerk and the custom and fine chemicals businesses of chemfirst inc “chemfirst” 337 million 

net sales for 2001 amounted to 9169 million down 06 million 01 from 9175 million in 2000 polymer chemicals’ net sales were down 390 million in 2001 78 primarily due to lower shipments 470 million and pricing 42 million which includes the unfavorable net effects of foreign exchange in flame retardants and lower shipments in catalysts and additives 253 million offset in part by higher net sales of 395 million resulting from the may 31 2001 acquisition of martinswerk fine chemicals’ net sales in 2001 were up 383 million 92 due to the company’s may 31 2001 and july 1 2001 acquisitions of martinswerk and the custom and fine chemicals businesses of chemfirst 594 million offset in part by lower shipments and unfavorable pricing in surface actives zeolites and the unfavorable net effects of foreign exchange 

  

operating costs and expenses 

cost of goods sold in 2002 increased 494 million 71 from 2001 the increase is primarily due to operating costs associated with increased shipments over 2001 in flame retardants and the company’s acquisitions of martinswerk and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses lower pension income as well as a charge of approximately 26 million 83 million net of probable insurance recovery of 57 million related to the discontinuance of product support for and the withdrawal from a water treat ment venture this increase is partially offset by favorable plant utilization and production costs and the favorable effects of foreign exchange transaction gains of approximately 17 million in 2002 versus foreign exchange transaction gains of approximately 05 million in 2001 gross profit margin decreased to 240 in 2002 from 241 in 2001 overall albemarle’s average 2002 raw material costs were significantly lower than 2001 energy costs in 2002 were lower than 2001 

cost of goods sold in 2001 increased 495 million 77 from 2000 primarily due to higher costs related to lower utilization of existing plant facilities and the higher costs associated with the company’s acquisitions of martinswerk and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses offset in part by lower employeerelated costs in 2001 resulting from workforce reductions which occurred during 2000 and the favorable effects of foreign exchange transaction gains of approximately 05 million in 2001 versus foreign exchange transaction losses of approximately 08 million in 2000 with the result that the gross profit margin decreased to 241 in 2001 from 296 in 2000 overall albemarle’s average 2001 raw material costs were comparable to 2000 energy costs in 2001 were slightly higher than 2000 

selling general and administrative expenses combined with research and development expenses “sga” in 2002 increased 73 million 61 from 2001 higher employeerelated costs for 2002 as well as a 35 million increase in recurring sga associated with the company’s midyear 2001 acquisitions of martinswerk and the custom and fine chemicals businesses of chemfirst are the primary reasons for this increase the 2002 increase in sga compares to a decrease of 86 million 66 in 2001 from 2000 primarily due to lower employee incentive award costs and the realignment of corporate research and development efforts as well as the benefits of cost reduction efforts offset in part by a 79 million increase in recurring sga associated with the company’s midyear acquisitions in 2001 as a percentage of net sales sga were 131 in 2002 versus 132 in 2001 and 141 in 2000 

  

operating profit 

operating profit by operating segments for the three years ended december 31 are as follows 

  

   

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

the company’s operating profit in 2002 increased 71 million 72 from 2001 reduced raw material and favorable manufacturing costs and plant utilization higher shipments in flame retardants as well as the favorable integration of martinswerk contributed to this increase the increase is partially offset by lower pricing lower shipments in fine chemicals agrichemicals and fine chemistry services product lines a charge of approximately 26 million related to the discontinuance of product support for and the withdrawal from a water treatment venture and a charge of 15 million related to workforce reductions sga in 2002 increased 73 million 61 from 2001 primarily due to higher employeerelated costs as well as a 35 million increase in recurring sga associated with the midyear 2001 acquisitions 

the company’s operating profit in 2001 including a 2001 workforce reduction charge of 21 million decreased 517 344 from 2000 primarily due to lower shipments the effects of lower utilization of existing plant facilities and the negative net effects of foreign exchange in the company’s european and asia pacific regions versus 2000 offset in part by an increase in operating profit associated with the company’s acquisitions of martinswerk and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses the operating profit decrease in 2001 versus 2000 was also impacted by the net effect of 2000 special items consisting of a onetime 150 million noncash pension settlement gain “pension settlement gain” and a workforce reduction charge of 69 million excluding special items in the 2001 and 2000 periods 2001 operating profit decreased 415 million from 2000 sga decreased 86 million 66 from 2000 primarily due to lower employee incentive award costs and the realignment of corporate research and development efforts as well as the benefits of cost reduction efforts offset in part by a 79 million increase in recurring sga associated with the company’s midyear acquisitions during 2001 

polymer chemicals’ operating results for 2002 increased 77 million 128 versus 2001 primarily due to higher shipments in flame retardants 159 million which includes the impact of the acquisition of martinswerk and favorable raw material costs 132 million the increase was partially offset by lower pricing 198 million primarily in flame retardants and a first quarter 2002 reclassification of bad debt expense from corporate and other expenses 20 million 

polymer chemicals’ operating results in 2001 decreased 441 million 425 primarily due to lower shipments in flame retardants 187 million and catalyst and additives 122 million the effects of lower utilization of existing plant facilities net of lower spending 101 million and the unfavorable results of foreign ex change 70 million offset in part by the impact of the acquisition of martinswerk 47 million in 2001 versus 2000 polymer chemicals’ operating results for 2000 included allocations for a pension settlement gain of 55 million and a workforce reduction charge of 31 million excluding the special items in 2001 and 2000 polymer chemicals’ operating results for 2001 decreased 414 million 408 from the corresponding period in 2000 

fine chemicals’ operating results for 2002 decreased 08 million 13 versus 2001 lower pricing 137 million primarily in performance chemicals lower shipments 109 million primarily in agrichemicals and fine chemistry services and a charge of approximately 26 million 83 million net of probable insurance recovery of 57 million related to the discontinuance of product support for and the withdrawal from a water treatment venture were the major factors in the decrease the decrease was partially offset by favorable raw material 137 million and manufacturing costs 128 million primarily due to increased production in the detergent builders product line 

fine chemicals’ operating results in 2001 decreased 93 million 131 primarily due to lower shipments and lower pricing in surface actives zeolites and the unfavorable results of foreign exchange 16 million offset in part by improved performance in agrichemicals and pharmachemicals 119 million as well as the impact of the acquisitions of martinswerk and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses fine chemicals’ operating results for 2000 included allocations of a pension settlement gain of 57 million and a workforce reduction charge of 31 million excluding the special items in 2001 and 2000 fine chemicals’ operating results for 2001 decreased 66 million 97 from the corresponding period in 2000 

corporate and other expenses in 2002 decreased 02 million 09 versus 2001 this decrease is attributable to a first quarter 2002 reclassification of bad debt expense to the polymer chemicals’ segment operating profit 20 million partially offset by a higher employee incentive provision and a charge of 15 million related to workforce reductions in 2002 

corporate and other expenses in 2001 which included a charge of 15 million related to the fourth quarter workforce reduction decreased 17 million 69 versus 2000 primarily due to lower employee incentive award costs and the benefit of cost reduction efforts in 2001 corporate and other expenses for 2000 included higher incentive award costs higher consulting costs and a 7 million workforcereduction charge in 2000 offset in part by the allocation of 38 million related to the pension settlement gain excluding the workforce reduction charges in both periods and the pension settlement gain in 2000 corporate and other expenses decreased 65 million

interest and financing expenses in 2002 decreased 05 million from 2001 which followed a 05 million decrease from 2000 to 2001 2002 interest and financing expenses were impacted by an overall lower average interest rate for the year versus 2001 partially offset by higher average debt outstanding during 2002 the higher debt in 2002 reflected the impact of the two acquisitions during 2001 as well as the repurchase of 4000000 common shares in february 2002 2001 interest and financing expenses were significantly impacted by an overall lower average interest rate for the year versus 2000 despite higher average debt outstanding during 2001 the higher debt in 2001 was associated with the two acquisitions during the year 

  

other income net 

other income net decreased to 34 million in 2002 from 43 million in 2001 primarily due to the minority interest of 21 million in the company’s majorityowned subsidiary stannica llc “stannica” partially offset by interest received in the amount of 20 million related to a favorable income tax settlement in 2002 other income net increased to 43 million in 2001 from 33 million in 2000 primarily due to earnings from investments see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies—investments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 on page 22 

  

income taxes

summary of critical accounting policies 

  

estimates and assumptions 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements listed below are the estimates and assumptions that the company considers to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company estimates losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 

recovery of longlived assets — the company evaluates the recovery of its longlived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 

acquisition accounting — the company estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 

income taxes — the company assumes the deductibility of certain costs in its income tax filings and estimates the future recovery of deferred tax assets 

legal accruals — the company estimates the amount of potential exposure it may have with respect to litigation claims and assessments 

environmental remediation liabilities — the company estimates and accrues the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on sitespecific facts and circumstances cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of the company’s contribution to the environmental matter ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and iii the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility 

insurance accrualsreceivables — the company records and assumes the recoverability of insurance receivables and potential impact of insurance claims based on the company’s estimates after considering advice from inhouse and outside legal counsel as well as outside consultants 

actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the company uses in the preparation of its financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

sales revenue is recognized when 1 ownership and all rewards and risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer 2 the price is fixed and determinable and 3 collectibility is reasonably assured revenue from services is recognized when performance of the services has been completed 

  

property plant and equipment 

accounts include costs of assets constructed or purchased related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on significant capital projects during their construction periods expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized but expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred the cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed

from the respective accounts and gains or losses thereon are included in income depreciation is computed primarily by the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets 

the company evaluates historical and expected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related business segments or fair value of property plant and equipment to determine the future recoverability of any property plant and equipment recorded recorded property plant and equipment is reevaluated on the same basis at the end of each accounting period whenever any significant permanent changes in business or circumstances have occurred which might impair recovery 

the costs of brine wells leases and royalty interests are primarily amortized over the estimated average life of the field on a yearly basis for all fields this approximates a unitsofproduction method based upon estimated reserves and production volumes 

  

pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

annual costs of pension plans are determined actuarially based on financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” the company’s policy is to fund us pension plans at amounts not less than the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and generally for obligations under its foreign plans to deposit funds with trustees andor under insurance policies annual costs of other postretirement plans are accounted for based on sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” the policy of the company is to fund postretirement health benefits for retirees on a payasyougo basis there are significant assumptions used in determining amounts including the discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase and assumed health care trend rate these assumptions are based on the company’s estimates after considering advice from a major actuarial consulting firm and using the consistent application of certain indexes 

  

income taxes 

deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes using the liability or balance sheet method such temporary differences result primarily from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 

  

investments 

the company has investments in joint ventures nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities the majority of the company’s investments are in joint ventures since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting the company’s share of the investee’s losses earnings are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other income net investments in marketable securities are accounted for as availableforsale securities with changes in fair value included in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets joint ventures’ and nonmarketable securities’ results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 

  

2003 outlook 

as we began 2002 we noted the slow global economy and the significant effect during 2001 on our polymer chemicals’ segment particularly the electronics and the plastics markets which suffered from diminishing consumer demand throughout 2001 at that time we were hopeful that market conditions would improve in 2002 after a difficult first half 

this situation again appears to be the case as we enter 2003 during 2002 we successfully overcame many of the obstacles thrown in our path by the economy and heightened global competition the company saw an increase in demand generally for the flame retardants sold into the polymer markets in 2002 however a sluggish 2002 holiday season in the united states raises concern about the prospects of a difficult first half in 2003 added to the concern of the global economy for the polymer chemicals’ segment is the continuing uncertainty in the agricultural market that began to affect albemarle’s fine chemicals’ segment in the second half of 2002 albemarle management cautions that the first half of 2003 will likely resemble the fourth quarter of 2002—a good period for shipments but presenting a challenge to the company to maintain focus on cost reductions selective price increases and volume gains in order to deliver growth 

albemarle actively manages contract and spot buying programs for raw materials and energy costs to limit the risks and maximize the benefits of such purchases to the company in 2002 the environment was favorable for many raw materials and the company posted significant savings compared to 2001 as we enter 2003 many suppliers are reviewing their pricing and while the company is protected in many cases by longterm contracts the 2002 performance of our sourcing team will be harder to replicate in 2003 generally the following key raw materials and energy cost annualized effects exclusive of any corresponding increases in selling price should be considered

ethylene – a 01lb price increase would impact earnings per share “eps” by 15 cents chlorine similarly – 10ton change  2 cents eps and natural gas – 1mm btu change  10 cents eps change including electricity impacts 

the company continues to generate good cash flow albemarle ended the year with a strong balance sheet and our net debt of 143 million is similar to the start of the year during 2002 we paid dividends of approximately 23 million made stock purchases of about 93 million incurred capital spending of 41 million including the investment in jbc and made a yearend contribution of 17 million to our pension fund this is a total of 176 million we believe we can continue to sustain such a level going forward and we remain cautious in our approach to uses of cash in 2003 and beyond priorities for investing in the business include capital expenditures and quality acquisitions that are synergistic to the company we will also maintain our strong dividend policy and will evaluate the repurchase of outstanding shares the company currently has authorization to repurchase over 4 million shares 

in 2002 we continued workforce reductions where appropriate as part of albemarle’s ongoing efforts to control costs the company will continue to search for similar opportunities during 2003 capital spending should be similar to 2002 levels in the range of 40 million and the effective income tax rate will remain around 30 albemarle forecasts a continuing reduction of pension income for 2003 compared to 2002 however modifications in other areas of employee benefits programs could offset a portion of this impact 

going into 2003 we will continue to monitor the effect that currency fluctuations could have on our business 

our polymer chemicals’ segment’s potential in 2003 is colored by an uncertain world for example the electronic printed wiring board booktobill ratio remains below one an important production ratio for the industry but the number of shipments and bookings used in the calculation increased at the end of 2002 even though “demand uncertainty” is the watchphrase of the day the company believes that first quarter 2003 will show improvement over the fourth quarter of 2002 

albemarle’s jbc joint venture began 2003 as a bromine plant however jbc is poised to bring on additional capacity of a key flame retardant if market conditions dictate the company is expanding the diversification benefits from the halogenfree flame retardant products added through the martinswerk acquisition and our joint venture polymeradditivescom the markets for mineral flame retardants include a number of areas that are not currently being served with brominated flame retardants 

in the organometallics area specifically new catalysts the company is optimistic that it will see continued growth as the polyolefin producers commercialize new products albemarle’s technical expertise and manufacturing position in singlesite activators provides a platform for success in this business in the base business in 2002 the company overcame the loss of certain aluminum alkyls business with additional sales in new catalysts and a number of other products stannica a 60 majorityowned subsidiary that supplies organotin intermediates became operational on april 1 2002 stannica has more than met albemarle’s high expectations giving the company access to an important heat stabilizer market 

albemarle’s sales in asia were up 17 in 2002 compared with 2001 this geographical region is an important growth area for both the polymer and fine chemicals’ segments there is an active program to enhance growth initiatives in the area and a great percentage of business leadership time will be committed to the region in 2003 2003 will be the first fullyear of operation of the albemarle chemicals shanghai company ltd a chinese company which the company believes will have a much larger impact in the region in coming years based upon existing sales and supply efforts joint ventures in the region and the anticipated growth of the market in china 

albemarle acquired ethyl’s phenolic antioxidant business as we entered 2003 this business is a 20million revenue product area the acquisition builds upon the company’s core strength in orthoalkylation chemistry and is a natural fit with the existing customer base albemarle previously served this business as a contract manufacturer for ethyl this acquisition allows us to go further downstream to drive growth in this product area it is an example of the momentum our bolton acquisition program has seen over the last several years and we are very pleased with this business as we begin integrating it into our additives portfolio 

in the fine chemicals segment albemarle made important strategic progress in 2002 despite the flat profit results in 2003 agricultural products face a downturn in the overall agricultural economy and the company remains cautious regarding whether this market has seen its bottom in addition tough conditions in the custom chemicals manufacturing market provided a challenge for this product area performance chemicals and pharmaceutical products continue to provide good growth prospects in 2003 higher chlorine costs have continued to confront this business overall pricing while mixed in 2002 is expected to improve in 2003 

uncertain agricultural chemicals demand raw material price inflation and competitive custom manufacturing markets could affect our efforts this leads us to be cautiously 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

optimistic about delivering profit increases for fine chemicals however continued discipline in driving cost reductions selective price increases and volume gains will be required to offset these headwinds the company has plans to address each of these areas albemarle believes that increased benefits from its new product efforts and success in filling flexible manufacturing assets also can be accomplished leading the company to forecast positive performance in fine chemicals in 2003 

fine chemicals ended 2002 with three straight quarters of sequential sales growth an expanded new product pipeline the full integration of the chemfirst custom fine chemicals business and martinswerk acquisitions and a successful startup of the jbc bromine and derivatives manufacturing capacities albemarle began to market commercial sales from jbc which the company believes will gather momentum in 2003 this startup was ahead of schedule and under budget and marks a major milestone in the strategy of global leadership in brominerelated businesses additionally the nonflame retardant products from the martinswerk acquisition the aluminum specialties should continue to be important contributors to overall fine chemicals’ profit growth 

the acquisition of chemfirst custom fine chemicals manufacturing products and assets has enabled significant and positive fundamental changes to the way albemarle is driving its fine chemicals’ business the company’s previously limited offering to the global life sciences market is now much more substantial covering a broad array of offerings and services—active ingredients intermediates custom manufacturing and contract research albemarle’s reception with customers has grown the new product pipeline has filled and the global flexible manufacturing assets are poised to benefit despite lessthantargeted profit results in 2002 from the acquired assets the capabilities have led the company to pull similar global capabilities together into a new business area fine chemistry services  intermediates which it believes holds significant promise for profitable growth for albemarle 

finally albemarle has focused great attention on the recently enacted sarbanesoxley act and related rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange as one example the company has installed an internal disclosure and controls committee and it intends to stay at the forefront of any corporate governance and financial control initiatives 

  

financial condition and liquidity 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2002 were 376 million which represents an increase of 70 million from 306 million at yearend 2001 

  cash flows provided from operating activities were 1448 million which together with 2813 million of proceeds from borrowings primarily from the company’s primary credit agreements and an increase in working capital of approximately 54 million excluding foreign currency translation were used to cover operating activities in 2002 payoff the company’s previous revolving credit facility of 160 million cover repayment of debt of 1128 million purchase approximately 4 million shares of the company’s common stock for 931 million fund capital expenditures of 384 million pay dividends to common shareholders of 230 million and increase cash and cash equivalents by 70 million 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2001 were 306 million which represented an increase of 113 million from 193 million at yearend 2000 

cash provided from operating activities was 1439 million which together with 1282 million of proceeds from borrowings were used to cover operating activities in 2001 including an increase in working capital of 45 million excluding foreign currency translation and acquire martinswerk and the custom and fine chemicals businesses of chemfirst inc 1132 million fund capital expenditures repay 541 million of longterm debt pay quarterly dividends to common shareholders of 238 million fund the company’s additional investment in joint ventures purchase 417505 shares of the company’s common stock for 76 million and increase yearend cash and cash equivalents by 113 million 

the company anticipates that cash provided from operating activities in the future will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses debt service obligations dividend payments to common shareholders and to fund most if not all of its capital expenditures 

on september 10 2002 the company entered into a new threeyear unsecured credit agreement with a group of lenders providing for 375 million in revolving credit facilities the “credit agreement” to replace its former competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement “credit facility” which matured on september 29 2002 borrowing under the credit agreement is conditioned upon compliance with financial and other covenants as set forth in the related agreement including covenants relating to leverage measured as the ratio of debt and interest to adjusted earnings an increase in pricing level based on the company’s debttocapitalization ratio would not accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness thereunder however an increase in our debttocapitalization ratio would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under the credit agreement 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

in addition at december 31 2002 the company had the flexibility to borrow up to a total of 82 million 335 million outstanding at december 31 2002 under its various other credit arrangements 

the noncurrent portion of the company’s longterm debt amounted to 1801 million at december 31 2002 compared to 124 million at the end of 2001 the debt level at december 31 2001 amounting to 1579 million was reflected as current due to the maturity date of the credit facility at december 31 2002 the company had the ability to refinance its borrowings through uncommitted credit lines with domestic financial institutions and foreign banks with borrowings under its credit agreement which matures on september 10 2005 

the company’s total longterm debt including the current portion as a percentage of total capitalization at december 31 2002 was approximately 241 in addition the company has commitments in the form of guarantees for 50 of the loan amounts outstanding which at december 31 2002 amounted to 208 million of its 50owned joint venture company jbc jbc entered into the loans in 2000 to finance construction of certain bromine and derivatives manufacturing facilities on the dead sea the company’s total loan guarantee commitment for jbc is 50 of the total loans which loans could amount to 811 million if jbc makes all of its allowable draws 

at december 31 2002 the company’s foreign currency translation adjustments net of related deferred taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity on page 20 increased from december 31 2001 primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 

capital expenditures in 2002 of 384 million were lower than the 2001 level of 499 million the company’s capital spending program is expected to be in the 4055 million range over the next few years with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be more in 2003 than the current year future capital spending is expected to be financed primarily with cash provided from operating activities with the balance if necessary provided by additional debt the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions of facilities andor businesses particularly in areas where our knowhow adds value 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations for capital projects lines of credit investments and various take or pay and throughput agreements 

  

  

   

environmental matters 

the company is subject to federal state local and foreign requirements regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment to the company’s knowledge it is currently complying and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances such compliance with federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle 

among other environmental requirements the company is subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party “prp” and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites management believes that in most cases the company’s participation is de minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled by the company or its predecessor company ethyl in de minimis prp matters the company’s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis prp matters the company’s records indicate that unresolved exposures should be immaterial the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

the company’s environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately 177 million in 2002 versus approximately 144 million in 2001 and 122 million in 2000 excluding depreciation of previous 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

capital expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2002 totaled approximately 321 million up 24 million from december 31 2001 

there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess of amounts already recorded could be up to 106 million before income taxes however the company believes that most of the amount it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations but could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period 

capital expenditures for pollutionabatement and safety projects for the company including such costs that are included in other projects were approximately 44 million 26 million and 42 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively for each of the next few years capital expenditures for these types of projects are likely to be equivalent to current year expenditures management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollutionabatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of operations the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and the company’s ongoing manufacturing and funding activities as a result future earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty the company has established policies procedures and internal processes governing its management of 

  

  

  

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries 

  

  

  

uncertain market conditions and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities which include the use of derivative instruments the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings cash flows and fair values 

shortterm exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 

the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize their impact on earnings of future periods 

the company’s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of 03 million at december 31 2002 the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous 10 changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december 31 2002 with all other variables held constant a 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of 04 million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of 04 million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 

the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december 31 2002 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 

when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 

the company is exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition the company manages the worldwide exposure of its interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through its regular operations and financing activities the company utilizes a credit agreement as its primary source of financing which could expose the company to changes in interest rates if various financial covenants are not met the company manages its ratio of debttocapitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest interest rate possible 

raw materials used by the company are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply conditions political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors the company does not use futures options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures however management seeks to limit its exposure by entering into longterm contracts when available

albemarle corporation and subsidiaries

      agrichemical intermediates are sold to chemical companies that supply
finished products to farmers governments and others these products include
orthoalkylated anilines for the acetanilide family of preemergent herbicides
used on corn soybeans and other crops and organophosphorus products for
insecticide use in 2000 the epa initiated a program that will phase down the
home use end market products over a fiveyear period that use albemarles
organophosphorus agrichemical intermediates in 2001 the company absorbed the
impact of some of these products that were voluntarily withdrawn
      the company continues to expand its bromine production capabilities with
the anticipated completion in late 2002 of a bromine unit and facilities for
production of calcium bromide sodium bromide and hydrogen bromide in safi
jordan with albemarles jointventure partner the arab potash company limited
the company continued its expansion of brine field and bromine capacities at the
companys magnolia arkansas facility that it started in 1995 the result of
the current phase of the program will be an approximate 36 bromine production
capacity increase over 1995 year end
      uv curing business acquired by acquisition in 2001 includes a complete
line of additives initiators synergists and inhibitors supporting primarily
the printing and laminates markets this industry is rapidly growing 810 as
uv cured coatings provide a more environmentally friendly coating solution than
solvent based coatings
      the companys subsidiary albemarle ppc appc operates a plant in
thann france appc is one of the worlds largest producers of organic and
inorganic brominated compounds used mainly in pharmaceutical photographic and
agricultural chemical intermediates appc also operates an electrolysis unit to
produce highpurity caustic potash and potassium carbonate used in the glass
water treatment cleaning product and food industries appc strengthens the
companys position in fine chemicals and provides additional manufacturing
capabilities in europe
      in polymer chemicals product lines most of the companys plants operated
at considerably lower capacity utilization in 2001 than during 2000 however
the aluminum alkyls plants operated at rates similar to 2000 in the fine
chemicals product lines most plants operated at somewhat lower rates in 2001
than during 2000 with the exception of the ibuprofen and inorganic bromides
plants which operated near capacity
      the company operates on a worldwide basis with i manufacturing plants
located in france germany and the united kingdom in addition to facilities in
the united states and has interest in certain joint venture production
facilities in japan peoples republic of china and austria ii offices and
distribution terminals in belgium france japan and singapore as well as the
united states and iii offices in shanghai and beijing china the company does
not believe it has significant assets in countries in which those assets would
be deemed to be exposed to substantial risk see note 17 operating segments
and geographic area information of notes to the consolidated financial
statements in item 8 on page 34


competition

the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace competing against a
number of other companies in most of its product lines some markets involve a
significant number of competitors while others involve only a few the
competitors of the company are varied in terms of size resources and market
share competition generally is based on product performance and availability
reputation for quality price and customer service and support the degree and
nature of competition depends on the type of product involved
      in general the company competes on the basis of the quality and price of
its products as well as customer services by maintaining a broad range of
products and by focusing resources on products in which the company has a
competitive advantage the company endeavors to improve its reputation for
quality products competitive prices and excellent customer service and support
competition in connection with the companys products requires continuing
investments in research and development product and process improvements and
specialized customer services through research and development the company and
its subsidiaries continue to seek to increase margins by introducing valueadded
products and products based on proprietary technologies


raw materials

raw materials used by the company include ethylene potassium chloride
aluminum orthotoluidine bisphenola chlorine phenol isobutylene caustic
soda toluene diphenyl oxide alumina trihydrate dimethlyamine phthalic
anhydride polystyrene alpha olefins maleic anhydride ethanol phosphorus
sulfuric acid and nitrogen as well as electricity and natural gas as fuels
most of which are readily available from numerous suppliers and are purchased or
provided under contracts at prices the company believes are competitive the
company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves
supported by an active leasing program the company has supply agreements with
the dead sea bromine group of companies the contracts essentially cover the
bromine requirements for the production of bromine fine chemicals in the thann
and portdebouc france facilities and provide additional bromine if requested
for the companys other bromine needs in addition the companys affiliate
martinswerk gmbh martinswerk has certain contracts which require
martinswerk to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate
page                                                                    page 4
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries

from its suppliers this is expected to continue as the company or its
affiliates expect to continue or expand purchases of aluminum trihydrate

major customers

due to the diversity of product lines in which the company competes no major
portion of the companys overall sales or earnings was generated by one customer
nor is the company overly reliant on contracts with any one public private or
governmental entity although loss of one or more major customers could have a
substantial financial impact
      a number of the companys customers manufacture products for cyclical
industries such as the agricultural pharmaceutical automotive electronics and
building and construction industries as a result demand for the products of
the company from customers in such industries also is cyclical due to the
diversity and size of the companys operations there is little seasonal
variation in revenues or earnings except for certain agricultural and
pharmaceutical products and certain electronicsrelated flame retardants
      in addition the profitability of sales of certain of the companys
products depends on the level of industry growth and our plant capacity
utilization in zeolites our volumes and margins were lower in 2001 versus 2000
due to a new competitor entering the us market we addressed some of the
impact through cost reductions while seeking opportunities to expand into other
applications utilizing these assets


other matters

the following financial data and discussion provides an analysis of certain
significant factors affecting the results of operations of the company for years
ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 in addition a discussion of
consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included
under a separate heading financial condition and liquidity on page 12

materially from its expectations factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations include without limitation the timing of orders
received from customers the gain or loss of significant customers competition
from other manufacturers changes in the demand for the companys products
increases in the cost of the product changes in the markets in general
fluctuations in foreign currencies and significant changes in new product
introductions resulting in increases in capital project requests and approvals
leading to additional capital spending

net sales

net sales for 2001 amounted to 9169 million down 06 million 01 from
9175 million in 2000 polymer chemicals net sales were down 390 million
78 primarily due to lower shipments 470 million and pricing 42
million which includes the unfavorable net effects of foreign exchange in
flame retardants and lower shipments in catalysts and additives 253 million
offset in part by higher net sales of 395 million resulting from the may
31 2001 acquisition of martinswerk gmbh fine chemicals net sales were up
383 million 92 due to the companys may 31 2001 and july 1 2001
acquisitions of martinswerk gmbh and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals
businesses 594 million offset in part by lower shipments and unfavorable
pricing in surface actives zeolites and the unfavorable net effects of foreign
exchange
     net sales for 2000 amounted to 9175 million up 716 million 85
from 8459 million in 1999 polymer chemicals net sales were up 517 million
115 primarily due to higher shipments 681 million partially offset by
lower pricing 158 million in flame retardants fine chemicals net sales
were up 199 million 50 primarily due to higher shipments 335 million
partially offset by lower pricing 131 million in performance chemicals and
pharmachemicals


operating costs and expenses

cost of goods sold in 2001 increased 495 million 77 from 2000 primarily
due to higher costs related to lower utilization of existing plant facilities
and the higher costs associated with the companys acquisitions of martinswerk
gmbh and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses offset in part by
lower employeerelated costs in 2001 resulting from workforce reductions which
occurred during 2000 and the favorable effects of foreign exchange transaction
gains of approximately 05 million in 2001 versus foreign exchange transaction
losses of approximately 08 million in 2000 with the result that the gross
profit margin decreased to 241 in 2001 from 296 in 2000 overall
albemarles average 2001 raw material costs were comparable to 2000 energy
costs in 2001 were slightly higher than 2000
     cost of goods sold in 2000 increased 571 million 97 from 1999
primarily due to operating costs associated with increased shipments over 1999
higher raw material and energy costs and the unfavorable effects of foreign
exchange transaction losses of approximately 08 million in 2000 versus foreign
exchange transaction gains of approximately 60 million in 1999 offset in
part by improved plant utilization in some flame retardant businesses and
lower employeerelated costs in 2000 resulting from workforce reductions which
occurred during 1999 with the result that the gross profit margin decreased to
296 in 2000 from 304 in 1999 overall albemarles average 2000 raw material
costs were significantly higher than 1999 energy costs in 2000 were
significantly higher than 1999 due primarily to higher natural gas pricing
     selling general and administrative expenses combined with research and
development expenses sga in 2001 decreased 86 million 66 from 2000
primarily due to lower employee incentive award costs and the realignment of
corporate research and development efforts as well as the benefits of cost
reduction efforts offset in part by a 79 million increase in recurring
selling general and administrative expenses and research and development
expenses associated with acquisitions during 2001 the 2001 decrease in sga
compares to a decrease of 27 million 20 in 2000 from 1999 due primarily
to lower employeerelated costs in 2000 resulting from workforce reductions
which occurred during 1999 and lower outside research and development contracted
services in 2000 offset in part by higher incentive award costs accrued in
2000 attributable to the companys improved performance in 2000 versus 1999 and
by higher consulting costs as a percentage of net sales sga were 132 in
2001 versus 141 in 2000 and 156 in 1999

reduction charge of 21 million decreased 517 344 from 2000 primarily
due to lower shipments the effects of lower utilization of existing plant
facilities and the negative net effects of foreign exchange in the companys
european and asia pacific regions versus 2000 offset in part by an increase
in operating profit associated with the companys acquisitions of martinswerk
gmbh and the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses the operating
profit decrease in 2001 versus 2000 was also impacted by the net effect of 2000

reduction charge of 69 million increased 360 million 316 from 1999
primarily due to higher net sales the operating profit increase in 2000 versus

interest and financing expenses and other income

interest and financing expenses in 2001 decreased 05 million from 2000 and
decreased 24 million in 2000 from 1999 2001 interest and financing expenses
were significantly impacted by an overall lower average interest rate for the
year versus 2000 despite higher average debt outstanding during 2001 the higher
debt in 2001 was associated with the two acquisitions during the year whereas
there was lower average debt outstanding partially offset by a higher interest

2002 outlook

we believe that 2002 will be another challenging year for us with business
starting rather slowly as world events stabilize and the global economy
continues to recover from the malaise that has carried over from 2001 many of
our customers end uses most notably in the electronics and the polymers
markets have suffered from a slowdown in consumer demand throughout 2001 and
into 2002 we expect to see market conditions remaining very difficult in the
first half of this year and we hope for a pickup in demand in the latter half
of 2002 energy and raw material costs in 2001 declined throughout the year and
appear at this time early 2002 to have reached a bottom which could allow us
favorable cost opportunities in most of our businesses this year we have a
concern that the strong dollar especially against the weaker japanese yen
could have a significant negative impact especially in our flame retardants
business where the japanese market is an important one we expect that benefits
from our martinswerk and chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses
acquisitions will continue as we build on the successful integration of both
operations into our ongoing businesses in addition we expect that an agreement
with atofina chemicals inc atofina in forming an organotin intermediates
joint venture should be completed by the second quarter of 2002 our
acquisitions and joint ventures provide business diversification and leverage in
our current business and technology we remain hopeful that we will be
successful with additional acquisitions or joint ventures this year
     in polymer chemicals pricing in flame retardants continues to be a concern
as long as we have soft demand and excess supply in the marketplace
consequently we expect downward price pressure to continue in tetrabrom one
of our large volume flame retardant products we estimate the industry is
currently operating at about 70 of existing capacity accordingly we have
elected to delay the start up of our tetrabrom joint venture plant in jordan
that was initially planned in fourthquarter 2002 we believe this is the
prudent thing to do given the weakness in demand however we have all the
equipment for this plant either in jordan or on order so we have the ability to
bring this plant on line in six to nine months if market conditions dictate its
needed we are enjoying the diversification benefits from the halogenfree flame
retardant products added through our martinswerk acquisition and our joint
ventures eg polymeradditivescom the markets for these mineral flame
retardants products are not as closely tied to electronics as is our brominated
line
     in our organometallics area specifically in new catalysts we are
optimistic that we will see growth as the polyolefin producers commercialize new
generation products which will utilize our strong technical and manufacturing
position in single site activators in our base business we are assessing the
impact of a customers decision to discontinue certain of its products that
utilize aluminum alkyls
     overall for polymer chemicals we believe we have done a good job of coping
with the various challenges in 2001 using effective business and cost management
and in 2002 we will continue our tight control stay focused on our strategies
and keep our customers satisfied
     in fine chemicals 2001 was a very good year exceeding expectations in
many areas a portfolio approach to our fine chemicals business helped offset
generally negative economic trends strategic implementation of our fine
chemistry services business formed from the chemfirst custom and fine chemicals
businesses acquisition began yielding results in building our new products
pipeline the number of opportunities that customers in the life sciences arena
are bringing to us for evaluation and development encourages us however we
recognize this will be a longterm process
     a number of important initiatives will continue to improve our fine
chemicals profitability in 2002 first we will continue to globalize our
ibuprofen business and benefit from investments in quality improvement cost
reduction and plant expansion projects second we are beginning the
implementation of a fivefold program that we anticipate will improve the return
on our naproxen business third we are working to gain real market synergy in
the agrichemicals market fourth we are continuing to expand our brominebased

water treatment business into both the recreational and industrial markets a
small business today growing at doubledigit rates the startup of our jordan
joint venture bromine and derivatives plant at the end of this year will
facilitate entry into new global bromine fine chemical markets preservation of
lowcost bromine supply is strategically very important to our future
     we were pleased with the performance of our fine chemicals business in
2001 we plan to continue in 2002 to expand our pharmaceutical and agrichemicals
businesses on a global basis and are working to populate our pipeline of new
products primarily from the life sciences sector we are also continuing to work
on a variety of cost reduction and profit improvement initiatives and will
continue to navigate through a large array of acquisition opportunities for
those deals that make sense for us financially as well as strategically

future will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses debt service
obligations dividend payments to common shareholders and to fund most if not
all of its capital expenditures
     the noncurrent portion of the companys longterm debt amounted to 124
million at december 31 2001 compared to 977 million at the end of 2000 at
december 31 2000 the company had the ability to refinance its borrowings under
uncommitted credit lines with domestic financial institutions and foreign banks

agreement credit agreement which matures on september 29 2002 therefore
these amounts were classified as longterm debt at december 31 2001 these
amounts are reflected in the accompanying financial statements on page 15 as
current debt all uncommitted credit lines will resume being reflected as
longterm debt as soon as the new credit agreement is in place
     the companys total longterm debt including the current portion as a
percentage of total capitalization at december 31 2001 was approximately
223 in addition the company has commitments in the form of guarantees for
50 of the loan amounts outstanding which at december 31 2001 amounted to

agreement of its size and nature including financial covenants requiring the
company to maintain consolidated indebtedness as defined of not more than 60
of the sum of the companys consolidated shareholders equity as defined and
consolidated indebtedness the amount and timing of any borrowings will depend
on the companys specific cash requirements the company is currently meeting

longterm credit agreement before september 29 2002 with terms comparable to
its existing credit agreement
     the companys foreign currency translation adjustments net of related

level of 522 million the companys capital spending program is expected to be
in the 4555 million range over the next few years with expenditures expected
to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in
sales capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be
more than the current year future capital spending is expected to be financed
primarily with cash provided from operating activities with the balance if
necessary provided by additional debt the company continues to evaluate
potential acquisitions of facilities andor businesses particularly in areas
where our knowhow adds value

     contractual obligations for plant construction purchases of equipment
unused lines of credit and various take or pay and throughput agreements
amounted to approximately 85323 and 65592 at december 31 2001 and 2000
respectively


environmental matters

the company is subject to federal state local and foreign requirements
regulating the handling manufacture and use of materials some of which may be
classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the
discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the
environment to the companys knowledge it is currently complying with and
expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing
environmental laws regulations statutes and ordinances such compliance with
federal state local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected
to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position
of albemarle
     among other environmental requirements the company is subject to the
federal superfund law and similar state laws under which the company may be
designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a
share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites
management believes that in most cases the companys participation is de
minimis further almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are
quite mature and have been investigated studied and in many cases settled by
the company or its predecessor company in de minimis prp matters the companys
policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned
settlement enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further
liability as a prp except for remote contingencies in other than de minimis
prp matters the companys records indicate that unresolved exposures should be
immaterial the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp
costs because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental
matters the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental
liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations
     the companys environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense
were approximately 144 million in 2001 versus approximately 122 million in
2000 and 136 million in 1999 excluding depreciation of previous capital
expenditures and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are
charged against accrued liabilities which at december 31 2001 totaled
approximately 302 million up 187 million from december 31 2000 primarily
due to the may 31 2001 acquisition of martinswerk gmbh bergheim germany in
which the company assumed approximately 167 million of additional government
regulated environmental liabilities as a part of the purchase price
     there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess
of amounts already recorded could be up to 97 million before income taxes
however the company believes that most of the amount it may be required to pay
in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts

item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

in the normal course of operations the company is exposed to changes in
financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions
in diverse foreign currencies and the companys ongoing manufacturing and
funding activities as a result future earnings cash flows and fair values of
assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty the company has established
policies procedures and internal processes governing its management of
uncertain market conditions and uses both operational and financial market
actions in its risk management activities which include the use of derivative
instruments the company does not use derivative instruments for trading
purposes the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic
analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future
earnings cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of
the derivative instruments the company does not hedge its exposure to market
risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market
conditions on earnings cash flows and fair values
     shortterm exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are
primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the
company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using
forward contracts
     the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange
rate exposure are the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and the us
dollar in certain of its foreign locations in response to the greater
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods the company
has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize their impact
on earnings of future periods
     the companys financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange
risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset
position of 01 million at december 31 2001 the company conducted a
sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio
assuming instantaneous 10 changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their
levels as of december 31 2001 with all other variables held constant a 10
appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an
increase of 01 million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging
contracts a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies
would result in a decrease of 02 million in the fair value of foreign currency
exchange hedging contracts
     the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio
represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of
december 31 2001 without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated
transactions
     when those anticipated transactions are realized actual effects of
changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on
earnings and cash flows in future periods
